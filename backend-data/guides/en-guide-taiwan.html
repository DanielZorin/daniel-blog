It's time to take look at Taiwan. Unlike previous countries, I only spent two weeks in Taiwan, which seemed not enough to me. How interesting it is that perception changes! If you think about it, in Europe I was only in Portugal once for two weeks in a row, and in most countries, even the sum of all visits will not reach 14 days.

Route day by day:
Taipei - 5 nights
Hualien - 2 nights
Kaohsiung - 3 nights
Chiayi - 2 nights
Taichung - 1 night

<b>Visa</b>
Citizens of all third world countries need a visa to Taiwan. The procedure for obtaining is approximately the same as for a Schengen visa: application form, plane tickets, hotel reservation, work certificate or bank statement. I read that in Moscow they issue visas for 14 days, so I played it safe and took tickets so that it would be no more than 14 days. But in fact, I was given a visa for 30 days, and it was very sad to leave. I got the visa in South Korea, at the consulate in Busan. A visa officially costs $50, but in Busan they only accept Korean won, and in fact it turns out to be a little more.

<b>Money</b>
The currency is called the Taiwan dollar, but in order not to confuse it with the American dollar, I will call it the yuan, because in Chinese writing it is called that ("yuan" is the counting word for any currency in Chinese), on banknotes and coins the word "dollar" is not written anywhere. One dollar = 30 yuan.
I withdrew money from an ATM, the limit is large, as much as 20,000 yuan can be withdrawn at a time, which was enough for me and even left over. You can also easily change money at the bank, including buying foreign currency.
The daily budget in Taiwan was almost exactly $50 (for two), this is due to the fact that there was little time and a lot of travel. If I stayed in Taiwan for a month, the cost would be $40.

<b>Language</b>
In Taiwan, they speak a Chinese dialect that is very far from Beijing; it is almost as difficult to understand as the dialect of the nearest Chinese city of Xiamen. Unsimplified hieroglyphs are used, which are more complex than both Chinese and Japanese, this is a little confusing at first.
The English language is pretty good; at train stations, markets, shops, and on buses you can almost always speak English. Many menus of even the cheapest establishments have been translated. In reality, I almost never used dictionaries on my phone, which worked all the time in China.

<b>Accomodation</b>
Accommodation in Taiwan costs $15-20 per day, but its quality is very high, as in China (and not as in the Philippines). You can find a hotel if you walk along the alleys around the train station; everywhere you can find a decent place for 450-600 yuan (and a single room from 350). Except for Taipei, I did not notice such hotels there, although it is quite possible that I did not know where to look for them.

In Taipei and Hualien, I rented a room through airbnb, which is cheaper than through booking.com, where prices start at $40. I used airbnb for the first time; in Europe it has never been cheaper compared to a hotel.

<b>Transport</b>
Transport is excellent, civilization is everywhere. Prices are lower than in South Korea, but higher than in China.
A railway runs along the entire coast of the island. There are high-speed trains along the West Coast, which don't make much sense unless you have very, very tight time constraints. There are also regular trains of three classes - more expensive, medium and cheap. Cheap ones stop at all small stations and are called Local trains. I couldn’t find their schedule on the Internet, but they run frequently in the west, once every half hour or so, but there are fewer of them on the east coast. The cheapest trains look like regular subway cars from the inside.

There are also buses, they are cheaper than trains over long distances, but outside Taipei it is not always clear where the bus station is. Taipei-Kaohsiung by bus costs 530 yuan, and if you go first to Tainan by bus for 360 yuan, then you can get from there to Kaohsiung by train for 68.
Travel prices:
Taipei - Hualien - 209 yuan. There are no direct cheap trains here, only expensive ones for 440 yuan, but you can buy a combo ticket for the Taipei-Luodong bus and the Luodong-Hualien train for 209 yuan, which will take 30-40 minutes longer than the direct train.
Hualien - Kaohsiung - 710 yuan, train (expensive)
Kaohsiung - Tainan - 68 yuan, train
Tainan - Chiayi - 90 yuan, train
Chiayi - Taichung - 144 yuan, train

There is a subway in Taipei and Kaohsiung; a token ticket costs from 20 yuan to 60 yuan depending on the distance. In Taipei, I spent quite a lot on travel because many interesting places are far from the center. In other cities there are local buses, routes are on baidu maps. In Tainan there is a bus from the station to the center, in Taichung - to the airport.

<b>Food</b>
Taiwan has divine Chinese food, but with a local flavor.
Typical noodle or rice dishes in local eateries cost on average 50 yuan, maybe 30 or 80 depending on the amount of meat.

Hot Pot costs 100-150 yuan; in Taiwan, you can take ready-made combos, rather than picking up ingredients individually. If you take it individually, then each ingredient costs from 15-20 yuan.
Many common dishes in China are not available in Taiwan, for example, I have never seen tomatoes with eggs or meat with shiitake mushrooms, which are found almost everywhere in China. In general, in China, the menu of any dining room was half clear to me, but in Taiwan, at first nothing was clear.

Skewers at street markets cost 20-40 yuan. Night markets are generally a bit expensive compared to regular establishments. Seafood is especially expensive; several shrimp can cost as much as $7. Battered squid on a stick usually costs 100 yuan, which is normal, but if you look, you can find it in the same market for only 50, which is very good.
Taiwanese shaved ice ice cream costs 30-60 yuan for a whole plate.

They also make fruit beer in Taiwan: there are flavors of mango, pineapple, lychee, and grapes. It is even exported to China, I sometimes saw it in supermarkets there. Beer is inexpensive, about 30 yuan per can.
Of the fruits, mango rules; in some stores you can find it at a ridiculous price of 20-25 yuan per kilogram. Apples, on the contrary, are super exotic and cost a dollar apiece.
In general, food prices are about a third higher than for similar dishes or products in China.

<b>Internet</b>
Wi-fi internet is fast enough and there are no problems with it in hotels. There is also Wi-Fi in Starbucks, McDonald's and other networks, however, you need verification via SMS, which cannot be passed with a Russian number.
3G reception is good everywhere. All operators have approximately the same prices. I took a SIM card from the largest operator, Chunghwa Telecom. The tariff is this: for 300 yuan ($10) you get a SIM card, 1 gigabyte for a month, and another 120 yuan in your account for calls. It was experimentally found that an SMS to Russia costs 5 yuan, and a call costs 30 yuan per minute, and the billing is per second. In my opinion, it’s much cheaper than Beeline and MTS roaming tariffs, although you still won’t chat for long.
It’s interesting that to buy a SIM card you need to provide two documents at once - a passport and something else. Fortunately, I had a UEC, which was useless in Russia (I wasn’t even allowed into a bar using it once), but very convenient abroad as a replacement for an ID. Probably, an internal passport will also work. If you have a driver's license, it will do.

<b>Orientation</b>
Of the three maps: Baidu, Google, Maps.me, Baidu was the most convenient for me, they have the most pleasant design and user-friendly interface. In addition, for some reason they are the fastest to determine GPS position. Public transport routes are included there, hotels - only the location, but not the prices.

<b>Entertainment</b>
Entrance to museums and parks is inexpensive, much cheaper than in China.
The most expensive museum is the Imperial Palace Museum in Taipei, where the collection of the Beijing Forbidden City was transported, 250 yuan
We went to the zoo instead of the cable car, which made no sense to ride because of the rain. Entrance only 60 yuan
Hot springs in Beitou (Taipei) - entrance 40 yuan
Marble Gorge (Taroko National Park) - free entry, but you need to buy a bus ticket for 250 yuan for the whole day (if you don't have your own transport).
Dutch Fort in Tainan - 50 yuan
Tree house, Tainan - 50 yuan
Alishan National Park - entrance 150 yuan, another 236 yuan one way for a bus from Chiayi. There is a narrow-gauge railway running through the park; travel on it is only 50 yuan, but I didn’t have time to ride it because I was caught in a heavy downpour.


<b>Resume</b>
Expenses for two for 13 days amounted to $655:

By days:
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945958376_b56fe0a8ed_o.png" title=""/>
In total, housing costs an average of $18 per day, food - $12-13 (for some reason, food costs hardly change from country to country).
I warmly recommend Taiwan; if you are afraid to dive straight into China, then this is an excellent alternative, everything is pleasant, comfortable and inexpensive.

Best places:
Marble Gorge is number 1.
