Denmark is a small, cozy country in northern Europe. I was there only twice, more than 10 years apart:
April 2012 - <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/245591.html">Copenhagen</a>, <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/245972.html">Roskilde, Hillerod, Elsinore</a>

<b>Transport</b>
Denmark has both trains and intercity buses. As usual in Europe, the basis is trains, and buses seem to complement them, but in principle you can also travel between main cities by bus. The trains have a full fare, and discount fares (Orange and Orange Fri), which are available when purchasing on the dsb.dk website, and there is often a small discount even at the very last moment. Reservations (for an additional fee) are not required in Denmark, as in most Western European countries. At the same time, the locals really use it, I had to change seats a couple of times, once even while standing in the hallway between a few stations.

Copenhagen - Aalborg (cross country)
Train: minimum 134 DKK in advance, 480 DKK at the last minute
Flixbus: 10 EUR / 75 DKK in advance, 150-200 at the last minute.
Bus fleet.dk: 129 DKK in advance, 200 at the last moment
Kombardo ekspressen bus (it does not go through Aarhus, but cuts off part of the route by ferry): 119 DKK in advance, 200 at the last moment.

We can also look at prices for a short distance, since if you travel around the country, it'll mostly be short journeys, as I did Aalborg - Aarhus - Odense - Copenhagen.

Aalborg - Aarhus
Train: advance 57 DKK, last minute 204 DKK
Flixbus: 5 euros in advance, 10 euros last minute
Bus fleet.dk: 59 DKK / 8 EUR

In general, it turns out that Flixbus is the cheapest option in advance, but they do not have as many departures as trains, so for convenience it makes sense to purchase train tickets in advance. Other buses do not have any special advantage over trains.

<b>Accomodation</b>
Surprisingly, hotels in Denmark are not as expensive as you would expect from Scandinavia. In Aalborg I rented a room for $50 (there was another one even cheaper, but further from the center). In Copenhagen, in a capsule hotel right on the famous Nyhavn embankment, a capsule costs only $20. In 2012, I paid more for a hostel in Copenhagen - about 25 euros.

<b>Food</b>
In terms of food, Denmark is not the most interesting country. The main local dish is sandwiches with black bread and butter (smørrebrød). Prices in restaurants are high, around 20 dollars per dish:

A Chinese restaurant is also not cheap. Soups are $8, entrees are closer to $20.

A meal at McDonald's costs 70 DKK. In 2012, I paid 55, at an exchange rate of 5.6 DKK per dollar versus 6.8 now. It turns out that the price in dollars has not changed at all.

The grocery stores are expensive, but you can scrounge up some stuff, like a $3 salad.

A whole chicken costs about $6.

Potatoes $1.30 per kilogram.

<b>What to see</b>
Denmark consists of five regions. Two regions on the island of Zealand: the capital region and the rest of the island. And three regions on the mainland: northern, central and southern Jutland (the southern one also includes the large island of Funen)

Copenhagen is the capital and largest city.

In principle, in the main part of Denmark I saw all the significant cities. There are also a couple of smaller historical towns and Viking-era excavations away from the major cities.
Denmark also owns the Faroe Islands and Greenland, but to go there, you formally need a separate visa (Schengen is not enough), which are issued with difficulty. There seems to be no de facto border control, especially in the Faroe Islands, but it is still a risk. Getting to these remote areas is not cheap.
