Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg (BeNeLux) are three small countries between Germany and France. Historically, all three constituted the "Lower Lands" (lower compared to sea level), and were united under Habsburg rule in the Middle Ages. Then in the 16th century their paths diverged - the Netherlands became an independent republic, and the rest remained under Spanish rule. Then in the 19th century, for some time (1815-1830), all three countries united under the rule of the Dutch king, but this did not last long, and in 1830 Belgium rebelled and separated. Luxembourg was formally a separate country, but the Dutch king was the duke there until the end of the 19th century, when these dynasties diverged. Although at one time these countries did not get along together, in the 20th century, on the contrary, they became pioneers in the unification of Europe - the borders between them were abolished even before the Schengen Agreement.
I have been to these countries 4 times:

<b>Transport</b>
Transport in all three countries is practically exclusively railway, long-distance buses are rare, mostly connecting to more distant countries.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-luxembourg-945723_1000.jpg" title=""/>

Let's start with <b>Luxembourg</b>. It's been four years since public transport in Luxembourg became <b>free</b>. This is the largest free transport system in the world. If in Tallinn (the population of which is not much smaller than the population of Luxembourg) transport is free only for residents, in Luxembourg there are no restrictions - not even for tourists. You can buy a first class ticket for 6 euros per day. Trains go from the southern city of Esch-sur-Alzette through the city of Luxembourg to the north, generally almost to the very end (Clervaux or even further), but in 2024 due to the renovation no further than the city of Ettelbrück. There are also cross-border trains to all neighboring countries. To smaller towns you have to take buses.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-luxembourg-945564_1000.jpg" title=""/>

In <b>Belgium</b> <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en">trains</a> are quite expensive, about 15 euros per hour, that is, closer to France. There is, however, the upper limit - 25.50 euros seems to be the maximum for one trip, even the longest one.
Brussels - Arlon (Luxembourg border), 3 hours, 25.50
Brussels - Bruges, 1 hour 15 minutes, 17 euros
Brussels - Ghent, 40 minutes, 10.80
Ticket prices are fixed; there are no discounts for purchasing in advance. There is one way to save: a pass for any 10 trips costs 99 euros. Considering that even a 40-minute trip costs 10 euros, this turns out to be profitable if you want to visit several cities. The ticket works simply - you need to write with a pen where you are going when boarding the train (this ticket is now also available in the mobile application). You can use one pass for several people, entering the route for each on a separate line. I used this pass in 2012 (then it cost about 70 euros, not 100), on the route Arlon - Brussels - Ghent - Bruges - Brussels - Antwerp.
Also, if you are under 26 years old, you can buy a Youth ticket, which costs 7.50 in any direction, or 10 trips for 60 euros..

In <b>The Netherlands</b> <a href="https://9292.nl/">trains</a> used to be more expensive, but now the tariffs are almost the same as in Belgium. Just the upper limit here is 29.40 instead of 25.50. For 29.40 you can travel for more than 2 hours, not only from Amsterdam to Maastricht, but also from Maastricht to Groningen with a transfer. Prices:
Amsterdam - Leiden, 30 minutes, 10.60
Amsterdam - Rotterdam, 1 hour 15 minutes, 17.90
Amsterdam - Maastricht, 2 hours 20 minutes, 29.40

Recently, an option to save a little has appeared: <a href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/onbeperkt-reizen/p/holland-travel-ticket">day pass</a> throughout the country. It costs 48 euros (but you can’t travel from 6-30 to 9 am on weekdays; for 70 euros you can do it at this time, but I don’t think it’s worth it).
<img alt="" src="images/guide-luxembourg-945285_1000.jpg" title=""/>

Public transport in Luxembourg is free, in Belgium it is structured similarly to France (tickets for a specific trip), in the Netherlands - similar to Germany (tickets for zones with free transfers). On the Brussels metro, one trip costs 2.10, a day ticket costs 7.50. In Amsterdam, a ticket for one hour costs 3.40, for a day - 9 euros. You can also pay with a card with a stored balance, then the price is 1.08 euros + 20 cents per kilometer.

<b>Accomodation</b>
Hotels in these countries are some of the most expensive in Europe, on par with Switzerland; even in Denmark and Sweden it is easier to find a hotel. This is especially true for capitals, since Amsterdam is almost the most touristy city in Europe, and Brussels is the capital of the European Union, where people constantly come on business. Luxembourg also has EU institutions, and overall it is a small and rich country, which pushes prices even higher. As a result, even in 2012 in Amsterdam there was nothing cheaper than 50 euros (when in Barcelona a room cost 15-20). In 2019, I rented an airbnb in Amsterdam for about 50 euros, the secret was that it was a little outside the city (in Amsterdam itself airbnb is very limited), but near a metro station. In less popular cities there are normal options for 50 euros, but not cheaper. In Luxembourg (the city) the starting price is closer to 80, but in Luxembourg (the country) you can stay in another city without any problems, since travel is free.

<b>Food</b>
The Benelux countries are not famous for their cuisine. There are, of course, Dutch cheeses: Gouda, Maasdam, Leerdammer, Edam - essentially the familiar “yellow” cheeses mainly come from here. But this is in a supermarket, not in a restaurant. Belgium has waffles (gaufres), chocolate and cherry beer.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-luxembourg-944822_1000.jpg" title=""/>
Also, French fries were invented in Belgium, although in English they are called French fries, which is probably offensive to the Belgians.
Restaurants in these countries are expectedly quite expensive, and I have visited them very little. In Amsterdam, I know one <a href="https://www.albina-amsterdam.nl/">budget place called Albina</a>, where there are dishes for 12 euros, not for 25. The cuisine is not Dutch, but Dutch colonial, from Suriname, but I think this is even more interesting.

The menu of a cafe on the central square of Luxembourg city, the dishes are already for 30 euros.

The menu of a cheap establishment in Luxembourg (in Vianden), as you can see, even in this expensive country there is lunch menu for 12 euros.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-luxembourg-946709_1000.jpg" title=""/>
Well, or for the same 12 euros you can eat at McDonald's.

<b>What to see</b>
The Netherlands is often called Holland in everyday life, which is not entirely correct, since Holland is the central province where Amsterdam is located. But in fact, the vast majority of tourists visit only Holland, since all the most popular cities are concentrated there.
<b>Amsterdam</b> is a city that needs no introduction.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-luxembourg-938034_1000.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Utrecht</b> - close to Amsterdam and in many ways similar, also with canals.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-luxembourg-943244_1000.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Leiden</b> is the closest ancient town to Amsterdam
<img alt="" src="images/guide-luxembourg-940845_1000.jpg" title=""/>
<b>The Hague</b> is the formal capital, war criminals who have committed crimes are also sent here
<img alt="" src="images/guide-luxembourg-943072_1000.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Delft</b> - another well-preserved old city
<img alt="" src="images/guide-luxembourg-939517_1000.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Rotterdam</b> is the second city of the Netherlands, famous for its modern architecture, since the center was destroyed during WW2
<img alt="" src="images/guide-luxembourg-942215_1000.jpg" title=""/>
<b>'s-Hertogenbosch</b> is the only city whose name begins not with a letter, but with an apostrophe
<img alt="" src="images/guide-luxembourg-942449_1000.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Eindhoven</b> - here is the airport where low-cost airlines fly
<img alt="" src="images/guide-luxembourg-939987_1000.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Maastricht</b> is the furthest city in the south, at the junction of the borders with Belgium and Germany
<img alt="" src="images/guide-luxembourg-941618_1000.jpg" title=""/>
In the Netherlands, I have not been further north than Amsterdam. It would also be interesting to go to the city of Baarle-Nassau, where the border with Belgium passes through individual houses.

Belgium consists of Flanders (northern half, where Dutch is spoken) and Wallonia (southern half, where French is spoken). Brussels is formally a separate entity, territorially surrounded by Flanders, but they speak mostly French there. Most people visits Flanders, as it has the most beautiful cities. Wallonia was an industrial region and is now in relative decline.
<b>Brussels</b> is the capital, not the most pleasant and rather dirty city (at least that’s how I remember it).
<img alt="" src="images/guide-luxembourg-938802_1000.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Bruges</b> is the most popular city in Belgium thanks to its vast old center
<img alt="" src="images/guide-luxembourg-938540_1000.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Ghent</b> is a less popular city, which is nevertheless no worse than Bruges
<img alt="" src="images/guide-luxembourg-940417_1000.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Antwerp</b> is the second city of Belgium, a commercial and economic center
<img alt="" src="images/guide-luxembourg-938338_1000.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Namur</b> is a small city in Wallonia south of Brussels
<img alt="" src="images/guide-luxembourg-941883_1000.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Huy</b> the name of this city sounds like a profane word in Russian
<img alt="" src="images/guide-luxembourg-940646_1000.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Liège</b> - the main city of the French part of Belgium
<img alt="" src="images/guide-luxembourg-941142_1000.jpg" title=""/>
I’ve been to all the key cities, but you can also visit smaller cities such as Oostende (on the sea), Mechelen, Leuven (in Flanders), Tournai, Mons, Dinant (in Wallonia).

In Luxembourg, the official language is Luxembourgish (very similar to the dialects of German in the surrounding regions of Germany), but French is often used in everyday life, and the inscriptions are also mostly in French. Most tourists visit the capital, but it’s worth traveling to smaller towns, fortunately it’s free - there are many pretty castles and hilly landscapes.
<b>Luxembourg</b> - the capital, a very picturesque city on a cliff
<img alt="" src="images/guide-luxembourg-941555_1000.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Esch-sur-Alzette</b> - second city, former industrial center
<img alt="" src="images/guide-luxembourg-940142_1000.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Schengen</b> - the city where the historic agreement on the abolition of borders was signed
<img alt="" src="images/guide-luxembourg-942676_1000.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Diekirch</b> - a small city in the center of the country
<img alt="" src="images/guide-luxembourg-939534_1000.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Vianden</b> - the most beautiful castle on the rock
<img alt="" src="images/guide-luxembourg-943506_1000.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Clervaux</b> - a city in the north, also with a castle
<img alt="" src="images/guide-luxembourg-939117_1000.jpg" title=""/>
