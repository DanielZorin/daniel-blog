Indonesia is the largest country in Southeast Asia, quite comparable in size to Russia. I was in this country in 2011, and was very impressed then, although I only traveled a little and with a much larger budget than now. Just a few years ago, Indonesia was underdeveloped, but the country is transforming literally before our eyes. Now Indonesia, in terms of the level of infrastructure development in cities, is already comparable to Thailand, however, the local population has not yet fully grown up to this civilization.
I spent almost two months in Indonesia:

<b>Visa</b>
Free 30 days without a visa, and you only need to enter and exit through one of the airports: Batam, Medan, Jakarta, Surabaya, Bali, or by ferry from Singapore. In other cases, you need to pay $35 for a visa for the same 30 days (you cannot enter by land from East Timor and Papua New Guinea without a visa obtained in advance). A visa on arrival can be extended for another month once, but a visa-free stamp cannot be extended.
You can get a visa at the embassy, it costs about $40-50 depending on the country and the local currency exchange rate. With such a visa you can enter for 60 days at once, and extend it 4 more times for a month. At the consulate in Kota Kinabalu in Malaysia they issue visas in one day (submit in the morning, collect in the evening).

<b>Money</b>
The Indonesian rupiah is famous for its low exchange rate - about 13,000 per US dollar (five years ago it was less than 9,000). You can change at a good rate at a bank, but you don’t need to change at exchange offices in Bali: everywhere there the rate is 500 rupees higher than the real one, but the money changer will try to swindle you. The largest bill is still 100k.

<b>Language</b>
After so many months in Malaysia and Indonesia, I, of course, learned to have simple conversations in Indonesian, so there wasn’t much of a barrier. There is an opinion that for those who speak only English, prices are inflated five times.

<b>Hotel</b>
The quality of hotels in Indonesia varies wildly. There may be two hotels next to each other with the same prices, but one will have air conditioning and a shower, while the next one will not. My theory is that since the Indonesians are even bigger sufferers than the Russians, they simply don’t care about comfort. There is no other way to explain, for example, problems with the shower. Historically, a village shower in Indonesia looked like this: you fill a barrel with water from a well or river and pour it over yourself with a ladle. In general, in Switzerland the shower was also like this in the 19th century before running water was installed in every house. When water supply appeared, the Swiss attached a nozzle and holder to the pipe to make it convenient to wash. The Indonesians installed a pipe at a height of 1 meter above the floor and placed a barrel under it, and this is how they live in the 21st century. Hot water is a mysterious and mysterious substance for Indonesians, which is why most hotels do not have it. Do you live near the mouth of a volcano at an altitude of more than a kilometer, the temperature at night is about zero? It’s okay, you can be patient and wash yourself cold, it’s good to harden yourself.
The benefits of air conditioning are also not obvious to Indonesians. Considering that from infancy they were accustomed to traveling in stuffy, cramped buses where people smoke cigarettes right in your face, this is understandable. Therefore, rooms with and without air conditioning can cost almost the same.
However, with the overall development of the country comes higher standards. In large cities and in tourist places, almost everywhere there are, in principle, several decently equipped places where you can live, at a price of 100 to 150 thousand rupees ($8-$12). The exception is Bali, except Kuta. In Ubud, the cheapest room without air conditioning costs 130k. Kuta has the best value for money in the country.
Interestingly, in Indonesia it seems that hotels are required by law to display a price tag at the front desk. It’s the same in China, but there the price on the board is always 5 times higher than what they’ll tell you verbally. In Indonesia, you can also bargain, but you won’t lower the price much. This rule applies everywhere except Bali.

<b>Transport</b>
I'll start with the good. Since Indonesia consists of many islands, the most suitable mode of transport is... no, not a ship, but an airplane. Domestic flights are very plentiful and inexpensive. All more or less large cities are hubs, so the system is not completely focused on Jakarta. There are three main companies: Lion Air (as well as Wings Air, Batik Air - its subsidiaries), Sriwijaya Air and Garuda. The latter also operates international flights, including long-distance ones, but their prices are outrageous, three times higher than others. Lion and Sriwijaya have a price of approximately $30-40 per hour of flight. Interestingly, you can buy tickets at the ticket office, of which there are quite a few in cities, without any extra charge, at the same price as on the website. So, for the first time in my life, I bought plane tickets for cash, and even spent more than 5 million. There were 7 flights in total. The cheapest was Manado-Ternate for 270k, the most expensive was Ternate-Makassar for 840k.
All ten airports that I saw in Indonesia (Medan, Padang, Jakarta, Surabaya, Balikpapan, Manado, Makassar, Ternate, Bali, Labuanbajo) were quite modern, comfortable, some completely new and clearly designed for further growth in passenger traffic. In this, Indonesia beats Russia with a crushing score - there aren't 10 good airports in all of Russia.

The development of aviation has made passenger ships virtually meaningless. They still exist, but are useless - ships depart once a week at best, ships take a very long time, the level of comfort is low, and the price is comparable to a flight. Only in the worst corners there is no airport.
Ferries run short distances between neighboring islands. They are cheap - about $0.6 per hour, speed 20-25 kilometers per hour. The ferries are large, they even carry trucks.
There are trains in Java that are more expensive than buses, and tickets sell out quickly. Trains have changed a lot in recent years; now there is no point in traveling in first class, as guidebooks recommend, since even in economy class, almost all carriages (on popular destinations with tourists - all) have air conditioning and even sockets.
Now about the sad stuff. If you want to travel around Indonesia by land, get ready to grind your teeth. The record bottom was reached in Java - 100 kilometers in 7 hours. Passengers consider it normal to smoke on a bus; the driver considers it normal to stop for lunch on a 100-kilometer route. At the same time, shabby buses without air conditioning cost about the same as luxury buses in Malaysia.

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946228043_56677838c2_h.jpg"/>
The quality of public transport varies greatly across cities. Minibuses cost 4-5 thousand per person. In cities such as Medan, Balikpapan, Manado, minibuses run along the main streets almost every minute, or even more often, and are in demand. And in Bali and Lombok, public transport has virtually died. In Bali, minibuses have actually turned into taxis, with whom you can bargain for a price lower than the meter. The Denpasar bus station is a pitiful sight of two empty minibuses and zero passengers. At the same time, there is no direct correlation with the wealth of the city - one of the richest cities, Balikpapan, where oil is produced, is also one of the most convenient in terms of transport.
More modern public transport is emerging, but not yet much. There is only a good bus network with dedicated lanes in Jakarta. There are two routes in Bali, and there are a couple in Surabaya. In other cities there are only buses going to the airport.

A metered taxi costs approximately $1 for 2 kilometers (6500/km in Bali). Motorcycle taxis, if available, are cheaper. Tuk-tuks in Jakarta have become obnoxious and are asking too much.


<b>Food</b>
Indonesians eat mostly rice with all sorts of crap. Nowhere else have I seen SO much rice eaten. It is eaten for breakfast, lunch and dinner in large pots. Even at McDonald's, locals eat chicken and rice, not hamburgers. At KFC, all combos come with only rice instead of fries; McDonald's is still holding out.
I don’t recommend exploring local low-end food at roadside eateries. Since the country is not very rich, the cheap food is usually terrible, instead of meat there are all sorts of intestines, hairy skins and liver. Plus it's often topped with a hefty dose of hot pepper. Such food costs 8-10 thousand, but it is unpleasant to eat even for a seasoned person like me.

Fortunately, if you raise the budget a little, everything becomes very good, the cooking is masterful, and the portions are excellent. Indonesia is a country where you can eat an Australian beef steak for $5. Of course, this is a big fat plus. In Bali you need to look for places - a random place on the main street will be very expensive, but there are restaurants with simply divine value for money.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945965711_31a15a5fa8_h.jpg"/>
Fruits, contrary to expectations, are not ultra-cheap. Only in Sulawesi did I find myself in the longkong season, and everywhere they sold it from cars for 5,000 per kilo ($0.4). Mostly fruits cost from 10k. Mangosteens 15-20k, passion fruit 30-35k, salak (Salak pondoh, much better than Thai) 15-20k, durian 40-50k per piece. Durians in Indonesia are not very tasty compared to Thai and Malay ones. I don’t recommend trying this fruit for the first time in Indonesia, you can easily get a bad one and be disappointed.
The country is gradually becoming covered with a chain of supermarkets. Even in such a hole as Sumbawa (so far only on the western part of the island), there are already nationwide chains Indomaret and Alfamart, analogues of 7-11. 7-11 itself is only in Jakarta, but the prices there are twice as high.

<b>Internet</b>
There are three main operators in Indonesia: Telkomsel (aka Simpati, Kartu AS, Loop), Indosat (Ooredoo) and Tri (3). The fourth - Axiata - has too little coverage to be considered. In short, Telkomsel is one and a half times more expensive than the other two, but it has 3G coverage almost everywhere. Only this operator operates on the islands of Flores and Sumbawa. Ternate also has Indosat. All three operators operate in Java, Sumatra, Borneo, Sulawesi, Bali and Lombok. Tri has the most understandable tariffs and simple top up, while with Indosat I was confused by the settings and what packages were there. Internet prices are lower than in Thailand and Malaysia. Internet expenses:
50k ($4) - Tri SIM card with two gigabytes of traffic (bought in Medan on the first day)
70k ($5.5) - Indosat SIM card with three gigabytes of traffic (bought in Jakarta at their office)
85k ($6.5) - Loop SIM card with two gigabytes of traffic, of which I could only use one, because my phone does not have 4G, and they count 4G and 3G traffic separately (bought on Ternate)
10k ($0.8) - a package for 300 megabytes from Tri, bought it twice.
You can top up your account in Indomaret, Alfamart supermarkets, and in small stores. A commission of 1-2 thousand rupees is added to the top-up amount.
Wi-fi is often available in hotels, the quality varies and does not always correlate with the distance from civilization. So, one of the best internet was in Ternate.

<b>Where to go</b>
Indonesia's attractions fall into two categories. The vast majority have few visitors, and the entrance fee is symbolic, about 10,000 rupees (less than $1). In Bali and in several other places the prices are outrageous (from $20 to infinity) and you have to pay for every step. However, there is nothing unique in Bali, so you can choose a free alternative without rude guides and crowds of tourists.
I will briefly describe all the islands I visited.

<b>Sumatra</b> is a large island with not the best roads. Compared to the horrors of ten years ago, it’s already possible to travel now. Interesting places are mainly on the northern half of the island. Near the city of Medan (the fourth most populous in the country) there is the Bukit Lawang Nature Reserve with orangutans, a couple of fairly easily accessible volcanoes and the magical Lake Toba. Near the city of Padang is the mountain resort of Bukittinggi and the Mentawai Islands, a suitable place for surfing. Near the town of Banda Aceh you can find diving and snorkeling. Overall, Sumatra is a very interesting island, and would be ideal if it were not for the long distances and bad roads.
<b>Java</b> is the most populated island (more people live there than in all of Russia). The population density of Bangladesh means that movement is very slow, since the city never ends here. However, there is beautiful nature, first of all, the Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park - one of the most popular in Indonesia (and at the same time actually free if you go there on your own). Jakarta, the capital of the country, is no longer the creepy slum city it was even five years ago, but a completely comfortable place. I visiteed other attractions of Java <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/228671.html">five years ago</a>.
<b>Borneo (Kalimantan)</b> - most of the island belongs to Indonesia, but all the attractions are on the Malay side. In the Indonesian part they only pump oil and cut down forests.
<b>Sulawesi</b> is an amazing island that few people know about. If you choose which island to visit in Indonesia, I would recommend Sulawesi. This is not the end of the world, civilization is like in Java, the roads for at least 50 kilometers around Makassar and Manado are good. I only glanced at this island, but managed to climb a couple of volcanoes and visit a place that combines <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/298292.html">Stone Forest</a> and <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/397719.html">Yangshuo</a>. There are also some top diving spots, including the very accessible Bunaken National Park, and the land of Toraja, where unusual funerals are held (you should go in the fall).
<b>Ternate</b> is a wonderful small island that was once the only place in the world where cloves grew, which is why the Portuguese, Spaniards and Dutch constantly fought there, leaving forts all over the island. The island is similar to Camiguin in the Philippines - they are about the same size, round with a main ring road around the volcano.
<b>Bali</b> - according to statistics, for 90% of tourists, Indonesia begins and ends here. Bali has good conditions for surfing (but poor for swimming), the best value for money accommodation in the country, hot water everywhere, restaurants with cheap, tasty and varied food. There is also no public transport, traffic jams, a severe lack of sidewalks, and most importantly, this island is inhabited by the most unpleasant people I have ever met. If you think that in Russia there is rudeness and poor service, in Egypt there are annoying taxi drivers, and in Thailand they overcharge tourists, then all this is just childish pranks compared to Bali. Only here they will try to shortchange you FIVE times in a store with a cash register and a barcode scanner. Only here the mechanical scales are twisted so that they show twice the real weight. Only here, every 10 meters there is a scam exchange office. Bali is the only place in Asia where if you go into an alley you can be shouted at, “What area are you from? Get out of here!”, and so I’m not sure I’d want to come here again, despite all the positive aspects.
<b>Lombok</b> is an island near Bali. The only thing that might be worth coming there for is to go to the Rinjani volcano. But this is not the easiest hike; you can’t do it in one day. The beaches in Lombok in the Senggigi area are well below average by Indonesian standards. The Gili Islands are also not impressive: the water is muddy, the underwater world is more than modest, and prices are high. I don’t understand how you can spend $100 to go there from Bali by speedboat - it’s trading money for soap. It’s better to fly to Sulawesi or Flores for $100
<b>Sumbawa</b> is the next island after Lombok in the Lesser Sunda group. Tourists usually pass this island without stopping on the way from Lombok to Flores, or sail around it. The scenery along the way is quite beautiful, the main road through the island is of good quality, but the transport is very poor and the infrastructure is poor.
<b>Flores</b> is a long island with traditional slow transport, which I only visited on the western end, near the famous Komodo National Park. These places are enchantingly beautiful, especially when you look from above from an airplane. The purest water and rich underwater world, as well as dragons from Komodo Island.

<b>Results</b>
For organized tourists who visit national parks with excursions from travel agencies, eat in tourist restaurants and take taxis, Indonesia will be a very expensive country, comparable to Norway or Switzerland. But if you do everything yourself, it won’t be more expensive than <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/423990.html">Malaysia</a> and <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com /400900.html">Thailand</a>, minus the inevitable domestic air travel. If we take the lowest end in food, housing and transport, it will be at the level of <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/414747.html">Myanmar</a>, but also with the appropriate quality.
In total, about $2,250 was spent in 52 days, including what I spent in three days in <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/427845.html">East Timor</a>. There is no point in dividing by days, because not all expenses are divided between two: while I flew to Sulawesi and Ternate, Alena traveled to Java, and I flew to Timor from Bali alone. But even so, taking into account seven domestic flights, it works out to $43 per day - a good result.
