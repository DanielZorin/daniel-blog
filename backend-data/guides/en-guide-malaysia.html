I present to you Malaysia, the best country in Southeast Asia and one of the best in the world! This is a country where prices are like in Thailand, nature is like in the Philippines, and civilization is like in Europe.
Malaysia consists of two large parts: the south of the Malacca Peninsula (I will call it “mainland” for brevity) and the north of the island of Borneo. Malaysia has 16 regions: three federal territories (the cities of Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya and the island of Labuan), nine monarchical states on the mainland (Perlis, Kedah, Perak, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, Johor, Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang) and four "republican" states. "states (Penang, Malacca, Sarawak and Sabah). I have been to all regions and all capitals except the state capitals of Terengganu and Pahang.

<b>Money</b>
Over the past couple of years, the Malaysian ringit has devalued from 3 ringit per dollar to 4 (last year I just caught the peak of the rate of 4.3 per dollar), as a result, now Malaysia's prices have become approximately the same as Thailand, and in many ways cheaper.
I withdrew money from ATMs, the maximum amount I found was 2000 ringgit at a time (about $500) from Alliance bank. It’s not a problem to find an ATM that gives out 1500 at a time, although many give no more than 1000. Unlike Thailand and some other Southeast Asian countries, there is no redneck commission of 5-6 dollars per withdrawal.

<b>Language</b>
The level of English proficiency in Malaysia is quite high - Malaysia was a colony of England, and there are many different nationalities (Chinese, Indians, Malays, Aborigines) speaking different languages. You won't even be able to practice your Malay/Indonesian much, except for reading canteen menus. The writing is Latin - the text is easy to read. The languages of Malaysia and Indonesia are similar, but even simple inscriptions have differences.

<b>Housing</b>
Hotel standards in Malaysia are slightly higher than in other Southeast Asian countries. There are few dead hotels with rooms without air conditioning, mostly air conditioning is everywhere, which will not really appeal to those who like to live in ultra-Spartan conditions. There are hostels for $5-6 in the main cities. The price for a normal room with air conditioning starts from 40 ringit. Over 60 you can find very good housing everywhere. On the mainland prices are lower, including in the capital. It's worse in Borneo. There, an average number will cost 50 ringgits, and you will need to look for it. Near the bus stations on the outskirts of the city in hotels, like in China, which are run by the Chinese, the usual price is 65 ringgits.
The Perhentian Islands stand apart. Since electricity is in short supply there, rooms with air conditioning are too expensive - 150 ringgits. With a fan, however, you can find a quite decent place for 60, or for 40-50 a bungalow with bare walls. But this is the case when it's worth it.

<b>Transport</b>
Everything is just fine with this. Air Asia is based in Malaysia, which means flights are cheap. I bought tickets 3-4 days before departure at very reasonable prices (and I actually bought a ticket from Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok the day before departure). Flight prices start at $10, without sales. On sale from $3. Baggage on a domestic flight costs about $6 more. On the mainland, flights to Kota Bharu and the island of Langkawi make sense; to other places it is cheaper to take a bus. There is no way to avoid a flight if you want to get to Borneo, the price starts from $25 one way (Kuala Lumpur - Kuching). I flew to Kuching directly from Penang, it cost $40, but the trip to Lumpur would have cost exactly the difference in price. From Sarawak to Sabah, it is also practically possible to get only by plane, because entry into Brunei is actually prohibited for holders of a Russian passport. A flight from Miri to Labuan Island cost only $20 with luggage on local airline MASWings (a subsidiary of Malaysia Airlines). A ticket from Kuching to Kota Kinabalu costs $30. By plane and only by plane you can get to Gunung Mulu National Park from Miri for about $40 round trip.
Buses cost about the same as in Thailand - about 1 ringit per 10 kilometers. On the mainland there are multi-lane highways almost everywhere, as a result buses travel much faster than in other Southeast Asian countries. For example, I drove from Butterworth to Alor Setar (90 km) in just an hour; in other countries it would have taken at least two hours. The roads in Borneo are worse. There is one main highway through the state of Sarawak, Kuching-Sibu-Bintulu-Miri (total 800 km), it is mostly two-lane and in some places not even very well repaired, the speed of movement is 50 kilometers per hour, and travel from end to end costs 100 ringgit, to the middle in Sibu - 50.
The quality of the buses is very high. I have never seen a dead old bus in Malaysia, even on local trips between neighboring cities (in Thailand, new buses travel only long distances). Often there are three chairs in a row, not four. Standing in a crowded bus I had to ride one day - from the Thai border. I saw minibuses in Malaysia only in the state of Sabah on local routes.
Bus stations in large cities are almost always located far outside the city, but you can get there during the day by city bus. There may be additional stations in the city center where local bus services throughout the region are based.
I haven’t traveled by train, it’s inconvenient because they run quite rarely and are somewhat more expensive than buses.
In Malaysia, all more or less large cities have public transport, mainly represented by large modern buses. Europe! Minibuses are only available in Borneo. Traveling around the city costs from 1 to 2 ringgits. Kuala Lumpur and Penang have the largest route networks and even have free buses. In other cities there are usually routes to the bus station outside the city, and to various suburbs. The frequency of flights, especially to Borneo, is not very high, they can go once an hour. Some airports (Kuching, Miri) are not served by public transport.
A taxi is not very expensive and does not overcharge tourists. Approximate prices: Tana Rata - Brinchang, 5 km, 10 ringit; Kuching - Kuching Airport, 10 km, 26 ringit, Miri Bus Station - Miri Airport, 15 km, 35 ringit.

<b>Food</b>
The food is excellent and very affordable. There are several different food options in Malaysia: Chinese, Indian, Malay and European.
Chinese food is presented in chifanki, just like in China. They serve noodle soups or more complex dishes at prices slightly lower than in China. Simple establishments are often combined into food courts with a common table area. Noodle soup costs RM5-6, fine dining is more expensive.

Indian food is primarily roti pancakes and tandoori chicken (also called infernal for its juicy red color). Roti is probably the most budget-friendly way to get enough. An empty pancake without filling (Roti canai) costs 1-1.5 ringit. It is served with 2-3 sauces in which you can dip it - curry, spicy curry, and sometimes a strange green sauce. You can eat two pancakes and drink some tea for another 1 ringit. Pancakes filled with condensed milk and bananas cost 2-3 ringit. Tandoori chicken is served as a set with pancakes, vegetable salad and sauces, and costs 8-10 ringgits as standard. Indian establishments are often open 24 hours a day, replacing the Thai 7-11 for late-night dining options.

Where the words nasi (rice) and mee (noodles) appear, this is Malay-Indonesian cuisine. There are many different variations on the theme of rice with additives. It is also very inexpensive - 4-5 ringgits per dish.
Establishments for tourists with European cuisine, like everywhere else, are expensive. But! In Malaysia, delicious burgers are often prepared as street fast food at very budget prices - for 5 ringgits you can get a burger with two cutlets. McDuck and KFC, by the way, are very competitive: from 12 to 3 and from 6 to 9 their prices are reduced, so a set lunch with a Big Mac or two pieces of chicken costs 10 ringgits.

All cafes serve a divine local drink - Teh tarik milk tea for 1.5-2.5 ringit.
There is a 7-11 in Malaysia, but unlike Thailand, the prices there are much higher than in a big store, so I didn’t use it often. Basically, at 7-11 you get three things: Butterfly ice cream for 2.1 ringgit (in other stores it is only a little cheaper, 1.8-1.9 ringgit), a Slurpee drink for 2.85 ringgit (3.05 in Borneo; very tasty green, better Thai) and delicious vanilla Coca-Cola for 2.8 ringit for half a liter (in general this is not very cheap, in hypermarkets there is vanilla cola in large bottles, but there are no refrigerators).
Products can be easily purchased in large supermarkets; fortunately, there are plenty of modern shopping centers in Malaysia. In all cities, such malls are located in the very center (or near it in historical cities such as Malacca and Georgetown). The cheapest supermarket is Mydin, where the choice of products is poor (most of the halls are occupied by household goods, furniture, clothes), but what is available is sold at wholesale prices. Of the strategically important products, I would like to mention chocolate first of all. Malaysia is the first country in Asia to have chocolate at affordable prices! A large Diary Milk bar can be purchased for RM5 on promotion or RM7 always. I bought Toblerone 100 grams in Labuan for only 4.50.
Seasonal fruits are cheap, RM4-10 per kilo. In Borneo, in the markets you can find a bunch of unknown wild fruits that grow in local forests, and which sometimes don’t even have English names, let alone Russian ones. This fruit, for example, is called mawang (Latin name: magnifera panjang).

<b>Internet</b>
This is such a small fly in the ointment. For the first time, I was lucky in all the hotels; Wi-Fi worked fine, although it was noticeable that the speed was far from cosmic. The second time I was constantly unlucky, the Internet was terrible everywhere with only small glimpses. On the island of Borneo this is somehow not very good.
3G works well and gives decent speeds, but there are no unlimited plans comparable to Thai truemove. Prices are also slightly higher than in Thailand: for the three main operators (Celcom, Maxis, Digi), a package per gigabyte for a month costs about 30 ringit ($7.5). I first used Digi, and then switched to the fourth operator - U mobile. This operator is much more profitable than the three main ones, because they are now promoting themselves. The SIM card costs 8 ringgits, of which 5 are credited to the account, and is sold in 7-11 stores (can be purchased around the clock). You are immediately given 200 MB of free traffic. If you add ten ringgits to your account, you will get another gigabyte of free traffic every month. A package for one and a half gigabytes costs 20 ringgits. In total, having bought a SIM card for 8 ringgits and putting in another 15, I got 2.7 gigabytes of traffic at a good speed. It’s nice that after the end of the traffic, the Internet is not cut off, like Digi, but goes to a very low speed, which is nevertheless enough to use the phone (but not from a laptop).
The only place where there were problems with 3G was the Perhentian Islands. In fact, there was a signal only on Long beach, and on the hill near the transmitting tower. So I had to go to the beach to get the Internet.

<b>Entertainment</b>
Malaysia is not the place to go if you want to get drunk, stoned and puke on the beach, go to ping pong shows or have tranny orgies. In principle, there is an industry for such entertainment in Kuala Lumpur, but in other cities and resorts everything is modest. Alcohol is very expensive because there are high taxes on it (a can of beer starts at $2). But if you want to see the natural beauty of the region, then Malaysia will be the best place for this in terms of price and quality ratio. In poor countries like Cambodia and Myanmar, national parks are not well organized and are difficult to access for tourists. The comparison with Thailand will clearly be in favor of Malaysia. Firstly, in Thailand, entrance to parks for foreigners costs 300-400 baht, in Malaysia there is also price discrimination in many places, but the price is three times lower - 10-15 ringit. The most expensive park in Gunung Mulu is 30 ringit. The cost of guides and excursions is also lower. Secondly, all the Thai national parks known to me (except for Erawan Falls), even the two included in the UNESCO list, are located in unclear places, there is no transport there, and in fact you can only get there by taking excursions, or somehow riding a motorcycle yourself paved roads in the park for an unclear purpose. In Malaysia, all important parks can be reached inexpensively by public transport, and walking tracks begin right from the entrance. Thirdly, Malaysia has the coolest caves. When it comes to marine national parks, Malaysia also wins here. In Thailand, all the places where you can dive and watch the underwater world are very far from civilization; if there is housing/food there, then you won’t like the prices. A one-day diving excursion will cost from 1,000 baht ($30) per person. In Malaysia, gorgeous places such as the Perhentian Islands are quite accessible; you can dive and watch corals and fish there right from the shore, or you can take a boat tour around the islands for $6-7. And even in Borneo, a trip to the islands with coral reefs will cost around $10 per person.

Results</b>
Traveling around Borneo at a fast pace (and also updating my wardrobe) took a toll on the budget, with average daily expenses jumping to $40 per day, although on the mainland it was around $30.

Food costs the standard $11 per day, this gold standard works in all countries. Housing is a little more expensive than Thailand, $12 per day. There was not a single analogue of a Thai hotel for 200 baht per month. Intercity transport cost more than $300.
