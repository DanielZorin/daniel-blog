Bangladesh is an almost legendary country, which is considered the very bottom of Asia (except for Afghanistan, where traveling is too dangerous). According to any ratings, there is no poorer country in Asia; Bangladesh is lower than Nepal, Cambodia and East Timor. More people live in a country the size of the Moscow region than in all of Russia combined. <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/386330.html">Philippines</a>, <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/410518.html">Laos</a>, <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/414747.html">Myanmar</a>, <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/427845.html">East Timor</a>, India... and so I dived to the bottom. What's going on down there?

<b>Visa</b>
I got my visa upon arrival at the airport. It costs formally $50.15, actually $51. Bangladesh was the second country where I was asked to show both my hotel reservation and return tickets (the first was the USA).
Visa on arrival is valid for 15 days, it seems that it can be extended if you want to dig really deep into Bangladesh. You can also get a visa at the embassy, then you can enter by land from India. However, I failed twice: in Calcutta they promised to issue the visa only in a week (holidays + weekends + standard three days), I did not want to hang around there for so long, and in Kathmandu I was told that visas are given only to residents of Nepal. In Moscow, it seems that obtaining a visa also takes a week.
An electronic system is now being implemented; to apply for a visa, you need to fill out a form on the website <a href="https://visa.gov.bd/Home.aspx">visa.gov.bd</a>, upload a photo, print it and bring it to the embassy. Maybe after a while visas will be made electronic.

<b>Money</b>
$1 = 80 Bangladeshi taka. Normal rate at the airport. ATMs dispense 15,000 taka in 1000 and 500 notes; Surprisingly, there is no commission (usually the poorer the country, the larger the commission).
There are no problems with exchange, the largest bill is 1000 taka = $12.5, the smallest is only 2 taka. There are coins of 1, 2, 5 taka, but they are quite rare. Most prices are rounded to the nearest 5 taka.

<b>Language</b>
In Bangladesh, everyone speaks Bengali; English as a means of interethnic communication is not needed here, unlike India, so almost no one knows it. Who doesn't know how to say "what country are you from?" in English, asks in Bengali, I even learned to recognize this question by ear and answer “rashiya”.
The inscriptions are also often not duplicated in English (for example, menus of cheap restaurants). In general, the language barrier is quite strong, comparable to Korea.

<b>Accomodation</b>
About 15 years ago, hotels in Bangladesh cost 1-2 dollars. These times are over, and now prices are comparable to other Southeast Asian countries. The minimum price for a room will be around 400 taka (for a single), for example, this is what a room in a hostel in the province would cost, or a not very good room without air conditioning in a hotel. I found air conditioned rooms for 1000 taka in Bogra town.

Perhaps in Dhaka you can also find one for the same price if you really look for it, but it’s difficult, because there are not so many hotels, the distances in Dhaka are long, and not all hotels say Hotel in English (and some places with a Hotel sign are not hotels, but restaurants). In Dhaka, I stayed at the Melody International Hotel right opposite the railway station for 1500 taka a day. In Chittagong at the station the cost was the same; for a bad room without air conditioning they asked 700.

<b>Food</b>
In short, everything is bad. Bangladeshis do not eat in restaurants; there are vanishingly few catering establishments, and even fewer that are not repulsive. The cheap menus are only in Bengali, so you have to choose at random. The choice is modest, the quality of food is low. For example, in Bangladesh I saw the skinniest chickens in the world - I have never seen such bony pieces. The prices are not particularly low - for the same money in Thailand you can eat much better. Chicken with rice costs around 100 taka. Grilled chicken at the station (it turned out to be hellishly spicy) is about 300 taka.

On the other hand, the upper bar is quite low: in Dhaka I went to a very pretentious restaurant (by Bangladeshi standards, in Moscow waiters would quickly be fired for such work) on the roof of a tall building to photograph the panorama, where dishes cost around 5 dollars. On the occasion of Ramadan, during the day they only gave a special combo menu for the same 5 dollars; in a regular canteen this would cost 2.5 dollars.
Fast food chains in Dhaka include KFC and Burger King. In principle, you can eat at KFC; a combo of chicken + potatoes + cola costs 180 taka, however, the cola in such a combo is about 100 milliliters in volume (I'm not kidding!). For 210 taka, the cola will reach its maximum size - it looks like 400 milliliters.

A liter bottle of water costs 20 or 25 taka, a small bottle of cola or other soda costs 30-35 taka. There are good lemon sodas in small bottles for only 16 taka.
There are few fruits and they are more expensive than in Russia, especially expensive in Dhaka. The choice is small: grapes, oranges, bananas. In May it was lychee season, they were sold inexpensively - in the provinces for 70-100 taka per kilogram. In the north, in rural areas, jackfruits grow en masse right along the roads; you can pick them from the tree, but I didn’t - it’s very difficult to peel.

<b>Transport</b>
Trains in Bangladesh are surprisingly comfortable. Buying tickets is not a problem, there are seats available even on the day of departure. There are no long queues and jostling of elbows at the ticket counters (like in India). Prices are reasonable, but somewhat higher than buses, which explains the relative unpopularity of trains.
If you look at the schedule on the official website, it may seem that there are few trains. For example, in Rangpur there seems to be only one train to Dhaka per day, and one from Dhaka. In fact, the website only lists trains that have cars with reserved seats. In reality, there are many more trains, and local trains call at all sorts of small stops.

Bangladeshi trains have the following classes:
AC Sleeper, First Class - sleeping cars with air conditioning. It seems like these are two different classes, but in fact I only saw cars with the simple inscription 'Sleeper'. There are compartments for four and two.
Snigdha is an air-conditioned seated carriage.
Shuvon is a seated carriage without air conditioning. It is divided into two types, but there is not much difference between them.
Shulov - general carriage without reservation. Here people ride on the roof.
I have traveled by train three times: Dhaka-Khulna sleeper for almost 2000 taka and Snigdha class Jessore-Rajshahi (496 taka) and Rangpur-Dhaka (966 taka). The last crossing was at night, but I even slept surprisingly well, because the carriage was almost empty, I could lie anywhere.
Unlike India, where all the trains I took were at least an hour late, in Bangladesh three out of three times the train arrived on time, and the third time the train left the starting station about 40 minutes late, but still arrived on time.
Train tickets can be purchased 10 days before departure. There are even sales via <a href="https://www.esheba.cnsbd.com/">Internet</a>! I tested it. To register, you need a Bangladeshi mobile number for verification. Then you choose a train, a class and pay. There were no problems with my Russian card! It’s interesting that when purchasing tickets you do not need to enter your name; what was entered when registering on the site is taken. If you buy a ticket for yourself, then you just need to print the PDF that the site sends, otherwise you need to go to the station and ask to print the ticket at the ticket office.

The most popular transport is buses. There are even modern ones with air conditioning, they mainly go from Dhaka to other cities. I got on this kind of bus once before Chittagong. Usually I rode around provincial towns in old buses without air conditioning. The fare is about 1.5 taka per kilometer. The average speed of buses is about 40 kilometers per hour, which is quite good considering the constant stops and the ever-populated area. The VIP bus to Chittagong drove along the highway at more than 110 km/h, which was scary, although in Bangladesh the highway has normal asphalt and there are dividers. And then it still stood at the gas station for half an hour.

You can get around the city by tuk-tuks, pedicabs, and sometimes by buses. In the provinces, this is quite simple: you go out onto a large street and get into any tuk-tuk passing in the right direction, which already has at least a couple of passengers. The fare ranges from 5 to 15 taka (depending on how far you travel), that is, very cheap. Electric tuk-tuks are very common in Bangladesh; in the city of Rajshahi, they have completely replaced gas-powered tuk-tuks. Elon Musk would be jealous. In the village, instead of tuk-tuks, there are collective pedicabs. If you charter a tuk-tuk like a taxi, then the price is whatever you agree on. The drivers don't overcharge in the provinces. Let’s say, in Paharpur they offered me a taxi to the city (more than 15 kilometers) for 100 taka, I didn’t even bargain (the bus cost 18, but it doesn’t go there very often).
Dhaka is a separate matter. This is a city of 20+ million people, where there is no metro or even any significant train network. There are only buses in total anarchy - there are not even route numbers, the direction is written on the side in Bengali. The fare is 5-10 taka, but traveling by bus is really inconvenient: there are a lot of big streets in Dhaka, and the bus constantly turns in the wrong direction, so you have to get off and wait for the next one.
In Dhaka, tuk-tuks are called CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) because they run on gas. In theory, the tariff is as follows: 40 taka for the first two kilometers, then 12 taka per kilometer. It sounds cheap, but Dhaka taxi drivers are really crazy. If in India, knowing the distance and the approximate price according to the meter, you can bargain somewhere for an amount one and a half times more, in Dhaka no one agrees to less than 3x, and the conversation begins somewhere around five to seven times the real price. As an option, Uber operates in Dhaka; its tariff is about twice as high, but for a tourist it will be cheaper than haggling with a tuk-tuk driver. But the big disadvantage of Uber is that it is a car, which means you will drive slower than you could walk because of traffic jams. At least tuk-tuks can zip through small streets, but driving a car is complete masochism.
Fortunately, there is still an alternative in Dhaka - bicycle taxis. Their drivers are more honest. Each time the bike taxi driver asked for a price approximately equal to the metered price of a tuk-tuk ride, and with such prices I didn’t even haggle.

<b>Internet</b>
I bought a Grameenphone operator SIM card right at the airport. For 500 taka you get 2 gigabytes of internet for a month - inexpensive. Like in India and Nepal, you need to fill out a form and give 3x4 photos.

<b>Entertainment</b>
In Bangladesh I visited the following attractions:

The Bagerhat Mosque is a UNESCO heritage site. Entrance 200 taka. In the surrounding area there are several other old mosques and the Sultan's mausoleum, everything there is free.

Puthia is an interesting old town with palaces and Hindu temples. For free.

The palace at Natore is Bangladeshi Baroque. For free.

The Buddhist Vihara at Paharpur is a UNESCO heritage site. Entrance 200 taka. It is said to be the largest Buddhist temple south of the Himalayas.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945968751_7634e0beeb_o.jpg" title=""/>
Rangpur, Tajhat Palace - I didn’t get inside because it already closed at 4 pm.
Sonargaon, ghost town of Panam Nagar. Entrance is 100 taka. Once an area with villas for wealthy Hindus who fled after the secession of Bangladesh. Now preserved.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946306684_56db1aa0a8_o.jpg" title=""/>
Dhaka, Pink Palace. Entrance is 100 taka.
Dhaka, Lalbagh fort. I didn’t go inside because it turned out to be a day off.
Dhaka, Armenian church. For free.

Where else can you go in Bangladesh?
Sundarbans National Park is a UNESCO heritage site (you can also visit the Indian part of this park from Kolkata). Bengal tigers seem to live there in the wild, but the likelihood of seeing them is low. Otherwise, this is a large mangrove forest; I’ve been to similar ones in Thailand and Malaysia, so I didn’t go from either the Bangladeshi or Indian sides, especially since visiting the park in both countries is very expensive.
Vintage paddle steamers run from Dhaka to the city of Barisal or further to Khulna; lovers of vintage transport can take a ride.
I haven’t been to the northeast of Sylhet province, there seem to be tea plantations there.
There are also a number of ruins of temples that are less famous than Paharpur, Puthia, Natore, Bagerhat, and therefore more difficult to reach.
There is a mountainous region east of Chittagong that should have a cool climate.
Cox's Bazar is a Bangladeshi resort. I didn’t go, the Indian “resort” was enough for me. In Cox's Bazar you also need to wear clothes to swim, it is a Muslim country.
In the very, very south there is a small island of St. Martin, lobsters seem to be very cheap there, but at the same time they charge $20 for a hut without air conditioning, so it’s hardly worth going there either.

<b>Results</b>
Over 11 days, expenses amounted to $414. Recalculating by days is not entirely indicative, because Alena and I did not spend three days together. But if housing costs $20, then it’s difficult to meet $30 a day.
Hotel expenses amounted to half of the total amount, just like in the USA, only in the USA housing is disproportionately expensive, and in Bangladesh everything else is cheap, and there is nowhere to spend money. Note that food for two cost $105 over 11 days, which is less than $10 per day without any attempt to save. In my opinion, this sets a record, but not because the food is so cheap, but because there was nothing to try.

Overall, Bangladesh is not such a scary country. In some respects, it’s even better here than in India, for example, the streets are much cleaner. But you probably won’t want to come here a second time, because it’s hard to find a pleasant pastime here.
