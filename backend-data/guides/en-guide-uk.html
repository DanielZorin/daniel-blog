The United Kingdom is one of the most important countries in the world and undoubtedly deserves a long visit. I've been to this country twice. In 2001, as a grant for school competition winners, I spent two weeks at a language school in a small town south of London, from where we went on excursions to London, Windsor and Brighton. In 2014, I flew to Portugal with two long layovers in London, during which I had a good look at the center of this city: <a href="http://goo.gl/2ygsJZ">part I</a>, <a href="http://goo.gl/L2buqS">part II</a>. But this, of course, is not enough, so in 2019 I finally pulled myself together and got the visa.
At school I was taught that Great Britain consists of 4 parts: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Still, it is not entirely correct to list them separated by commas, because only Scotland has real autonomy. Wales has been united with England for at least 700 years, and there is almost no autonomy there. A country called United Kingdom appeared at the beginning of the 18th century, before that there were two countries - England and Scotland, which had the same king since the beginning of the 17th century.
In addition to Great Britain and Northern Ireland, there are three more territories with a special status nearby: the Isle of Man (between Scotland and Ireland), the Island of Jersey and the group of islands of Guernsey, Alderney and Sark, united into a single unit called Guernsey (all off the northern coasts France). These territories are not part of the United Kingdom, but have a status similar to overseas territories, like Gibraltar. They have never been part of the European Union, from which Britain itself is now leaving; Guernsey and Jersey formally have a customs border. In lists of countries of the world, they are usually distinguished as three different countries, along with other overseas territories and colonies.
I acted in two steps: the first time I visited <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/549562.html">Ireland</a>, Guernsey, Jersey, Man, part of England and Wales, the second time - England and Scotland. In total, I spent a little less than 4 weeks in these countries this year.

<b>Visa</b>
The UK requires a visa, which was obviously the main reason why I put off going there for so long. In the old days, obtaining a visa was even more problematic than Schengen - printing a bunch of papers, translating, standing in line at the consulate, all in the worst traditions. Things have changed in the last couple of years and it's not that difficult of a visa now. The form is filled out on the website, all documents are also sent in the form of scans (you can translate into English yourself). You need to come to the visa center twice - give your fingerprints and passport, and then pick up your passport. It took a long time - everything took three weeks, because the next appointment in the visa center was in a week, and the review took another two (this is the usual time frame). It’s funny that in the visa center there are free slots and paid VIP ones for some exorbitant amount around 10 thousand rubles, and free slots only for a few hours a day, and the rest of the time they are paid (But in fact, the visa center is probably stupidly empty, because I can hardly imagine who would pay so much, except for the oligarchs).
Visa documents are approximately the same as in other English-speaking countries (<a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/535106.html">Australia</a>, <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/533372.html">New Zealand</a>, <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/529676.html">Canada</a>) - income, travel experience. And no fake hotel reservations or airline tickets. The only difference is in the level of requirements: roughly speaking, if you have an average income and only had Schengen, then you most likely will not be get a visa to Canada, but Uk is not a problem. The refusal rate is now surprisingly low, at the Schengen level of 2%, although in the old days it was higher than in the United States.
A visa costs about 100 pounds (for some reason I was charged in dollars without conversion - $124). There is no need to pay separately for visa center services.
The visa is valid for 6 months and begins to be valid a little earlier than the travel dates indicated in the application form. You can get a visa for 2, 5 or even 10 years, for this you just need to initially ask for this in the application form, but then the visa fee will be much higher, for example, for 10 years - almost 1000 pounds! This is, of course, half the price of getting 20 six-month visas for £100, but is only relevant to the most devoted fans of the UK.

<b>Currency</b>
The currency of the UK is called pound sterling. The main banknotes of 5, 10, 20 and 50 pounds are issued by the Bank of England; they can be bought at exchange offices abroad, including in Russia. Scotland and Northern Ireland issue their own banknotes, and in both cases this is done by several private banks, each bank has its own banknote design. Formally, outside of Scotland, Scottish banknotes are not required to be accepted in stores (although more or less large stores will accept them), but you certainly cannot change them abroad. It is best to exchange such banknotes for English banknotes at any bank in England.
Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man have their own Guernsey, Jersey and Manx pound notes, which in the UK can only be exchanged in banks. Also, more distant colonies have their own pounds, equal to 1:1 English: <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/tag/gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, the Falkland Islands and St. Helena. Other British colonies (mostly in the Caribbean) use separate currencies or US dollars.
Oddly enough, the coins are the same everywhere within Britain; there are no separate Scottish and Northern Irish coins. The islands of Guernsey, Jersey, and Man have their own coins, which have added to my collection.
Interestingly, Britain was the last country in the world to switch to a decimal currency system, where 1 pound = 100 pence. Until 1972, there were 20 shillings and 240 pence in 1 pound. And the first country in the world to switch to a decimal currency system was Russia under Peter I.
The UK is one of the most cashless countries in Europe. In the eurozone paying with a 50 euro note is not a problem at all, all ATMs are mostly loaded with them, but in the UK ATMs give out packs of twenties, and changing 50 can be a problem, for example, on the bus from Luton airport there was no change from 50, despite the fact that the fare is not 1 or 2, but as much as 12 pounds. Even on city buses in cities like Birmingham you can pay via PayPass, just like in Moscow!

<b>Language</b>
In the UK they speak English. You are unlikely to hear Welsh, Scottish, Irish, Manx, and Cornish languages ​​of the Celtic group; at most, they have inscriptions in their respective regions.
It turns out there are two Scotешыр languages. The first is Scottish Gaelic of the Celtic group, spoken mainly in the far north and on the islands along the coast. Like other Celtic languages, it is not similar to English at all. The second is the Scottish language of the Germanic group (Scots), which is spoken in the south and center of Scotland. English and Scottish are about as similar as Russian and Belarusian.
Residents of Great Britain usually refer to their country by the abbreviation UK. The word England refers only to England itself, and never extends to the entire country (in other languages/countries, UK is often called England).

<b>Accomodation</b>
As in other English-speaking countries, hotels in the UK are losing out to airbnb. On Booking.com, the cheapest options will also be mainly apartments, rented out entirely or per room. However, I used Booking more than once when I stayed for one night.
In Southampton, through booking, I stayed in a real student dormitory, which was partially rented out room by room during the summer holidays. Compared to the dormitories of Moscow State University, this is, of course, luxury; in fact, you can’t distinguish it from a hotel.
Jersey was the first of two times I spent the night in a traditional hotel, with dozens of rooms, a buffet breakfast, and daily housekeeping that irritates me in hotels. This was the most expensive overnight stay - about 70 pounds. In Jersey and Guernsey, things are very bad with affordable housing.
In Cardiff, I spent the night in a hostel - a single room close to the center was quite inexpensive (about 25 pounds), but in terms of comfort it was probably the worst accommodation of both trips - a terribly uncomfortable bed, like in the Moscow State University dormitories, and the frying pan in the kitchen was the most overused I have ever seen. In general, in hostels, of course, you can cook, but it’s not particularly convenient - there’s usually a crowd in the kitchen, you almost have to wait in line for a free burner on the stove, broken dishes and a shortage of oil/salt. The kitchen is usually closed at night, so cheating and having dinner after the crowd has left won’t work either.
In Liverpool I rented a room in a very nice modern apartment, which was located in local social housing for refugees and low-income people: the entrance looked extremely rundown and smelled strongly of damp, one of the elevators did not work, and the second one was also broken for the whole day, so I went up to 14th floor on foot. But the apartment was gorgeous.

In London, housing is expensive as expected. It might make sense to book well in advance. I ended up living all the way in zone 4 of the metro (it cost about 50 pounds per day), however, this is not so scary, because a ticket in the first zone costs 2.40 pounds, and from the first to the fourth - 2.80, not much more expensive (peak fare is really more expensive - 3.90). It took 20-30 minutes to get to the center by metro. Before my return flight I stayed overnight at an Ibis hotel near Luton Airport for £53 to avoid having to get up for the bus at 4am.

<b>Transport</b>
Since October, you can travel from Russia to London by low-cost airline - Wizz Air flies to Moscow and St. Petersburg. Until 2015, easyJet flew from Moscow, I managed to get there, but then the route was closed. A huge number of low-cost airlines fly from England to other European countries, including the Baltics.
Domestic flights are also very cheap, both from Ryanair and easyJet, and from the smaller airline FlyBe, which, in particular, flies to Guernsey, Jersey and Maine.
Like most European countries, the UK has a very developed passenger rail network. The system is very tricky: as I understand it, the railroads are privatized, and there are many local operators operating in certain regions, but they are all united by the common National Rail system. That is, you go to the website <a href="https://nationalrail.co.uk">https://nationalrail.co.uk</a>, look for trains there in any direction, and when you click on the "buy" button you are redirected to the website of the railway company that owns the selected route. It’s not very convenient that you have to register on new sites every time and enter all the data.
Tariffs in the UK are very dependent on time. If you come to the station and try to buy a ticket for the next train, you will be very unpleasantly surprised by the price. For example, from London to Oxford (only an hour's drive) a ticket costs 33.70 pounds - that's 40 dollars! Even in Switzerland, tickets cost about half as much. But if you buy a ticket for the same train in advance, it will cost 5.40 - about the same as in Italy and cheaper than in Germany, France or Netherlands. Hence the conclusion: ABSOLUTELY ALL movements between cities, even neighboring ones, need to be planned and tickets purchased in advance. Spontaneity is not encouraged when traveling around the UK.
There are simply an incredible number of types of tickets. I once stood at Manchester station and bought a train ticket to the airport: the machine offered me no less than 50 ticket options: by default, a ticket for any train for £5.50 was selected, but in the jungle of the list I found the opportunity to buy a ticket valid only for one of two railway companies, which cost 3.90 (both companies go to the airport with an interval of 10-15 minutes). But the main options that may be of interest (if you are not a student/pensioner/other benefit recipient) are:
- Anytime - a ticket valid at any time of the day costs the maximum (London-Oxford 33.70)
- Off-peak - a ticket valid at any time of the day after 9:30 am, cheaper, but still expensive (London-Oxford 27.30)
- Advance - bought on the Internet, and is valid only for one specific train, is cheap (London-Oxford 5.40-7 pounds)
The problem is that Advance tickets are often simply not available for very short trips (less than an hour). Therefore, for example, a ticket from Bath to Bristol (10 minutes drive) costs 10 pounds, and you can’t buy it cheaper. Therefore, if you have a very short trip, you need to look for options to get there by bus; there are often commuter buses that are much cheaper than trains.

All of the above applies to trains in England, Scotland and Wales. In Northern Ireland, the tariff system on the railways is flat (I already described it in the review of Ireland), the ticket price does not depend on the time of purchase.
All my trips:
London - Salisbury, train, £9
Salisbury - Stonehenge, bus, £31.50 including entrance to Stonehenge.
Salisbury - Southampton, train, 9.90. I bought it at the station because it wasn’t cheaper in advance. The most expensive trip in terms of time. You can get there by bus for 8
Birmingham - Cardiff, Megabus, £5.11
Cardiff - Bath, train, £6 (change in Bristol)
Bath - Bristol, bus, 6.60. By train this ten-minute journey would have cost £10, but by bus I bought a whole-day pass for the whole region, so I rode around Bristol two more times, and then to Bristol airport all for 6.60
Londonderry - Giant's Causeway - Belfast, train, £17.50
Manchester - Liverpool, train, 3.20 there and 3.10 back.
London - Oxford, train, 7 there and 5.40 back. I took it a little late, in general the minimum price there is also 5.40.
London - Cambridge, national bus, 10.40 return. By train no less than 16.
Edinburgh - Glasgow, Megabus, 3.60 there and 3.60 back
Tour of Scotland, £54 (Timberbush tours).
Edinburgh - Newcastle, Megabus, 8.80
Newcastle - York, train, 12.20
York - Newark, train, 7.80
Newark - London, train, 13 pounds. Splitting a trip from York to London in the middle turned out to be significantly cheaper than buying a direct train ticket

<b>By city</b>
London. The oldest metro in the world is located here. You need to buy an Oyster card with a deposit of 5 pounds (the deposit and the balance can be returned at the box office), travel through the center costs 2.40, and a little more expensive to further areas. The daily limit for three zones is about 8 pounds, for four zones it’s about 10.
Island of Guernsey. Buses run all over the island, including two routes that make a full circle. One trip costs £1, a day ticket costs £5.
Jersey Island. There are buses all over the island, but they all start from the main city, so you can’t go around the perimeter. One trip 2.30, whole day 8.
Isle Of Man. Buses are frequent throughout the island, a day pass costs 7, single trip is very expensive and depends on the distance, for example from the airport to Douglas it's more than 3, so the benefit of the pass is obvious. There are routes not through the capital.
Birmingham. There is a system of high-speed trams, including to neighboring cities of the agglomeration. Now it is in the process of expansion, which is why the central square is half closed - they are making a new stop there. I only took the airport bus, a regular city bus cost about £2.50.
Bristol. Bus network. I bought a ticket for all buses in the region, including the airport and the city of Bath, for 6.60.
Manchester. A good network of high-speed trams, the fare is 4.80 for the whole day, you can take the tram to the airport (but slower than the train).
Liverpool. There are only buses in this city; one trip costs 2.30, including to the airport.
Edinburgh. There are buses and one tram line. One trip costs 1.70, a ticket for the whole day is 4. The airport fare is 5-6, but you can walk in 15 minutes to the penultimate tram stop, where the regular fare is applied.
Glasgow. There is a ring metro line, the third oldest metro in the world. One trip costs 1.75, an all-day ticket costs 4.20.
Newcastle. There is also a metro here, which covers not only Newcastle, but also neighboring cities. There are three zones, the ticket price depends on the number of zones. I bought an Explorer ticket for 10.90, which allows you to travel on tubes and buses not only in Newcastle, but throughout the North East region, including Durham and Hexham. Otherwise the two cities are in different zones and the cheaper £7 day tickets don't cover them both, or cover Newcastle tube.

<b>Food</b>
England is famous for food only in a negative sense, so there is nothing special to catch in terms of haute cuisine, but the selection of goods in stores is more than decent, at the level of other Western European countries. The main supermarket chains are Tesco, Iceland, Waitrose, Marks and Spencer, Lidl. Most often in cities you can find Tesco, which is also cheaper than Waitrose and Marks and Spencer. Various types of meat and mushrooms are cheap. You can buy good half-cooked oven or microwave meals for £2-3.
Beer is almost always sold in packs of 4 cans; in such packs, one can costs 1-1.5 pounds, which is much cheaper than in neighboring Ireland.
I almost didn’t go to restaurants, but I noticed that the prices there were somewhat lower than usual in Western Europe. Dishes for £6-8 are not uncommon.

A standard meal at McDonald's costs around £6 (different taxes may apply in different regions).

<b>Other</b>
For the Internet, I used, as usual in Europe, DreamSim (10 euros/GB).
The UK is home to one of four main types of sockets (European, American, English and Australian). English-type sockets have three holes, you can clamp the grounding on top with a handle or use a special patch that turns this socket into a regular European one, fortunately I have it, since I’ve been to a bunch of countries with the same sockets (Malta, Cyprus, Malaysia, Hong Kong ).
The UK officially uses the metric system, but the transition to it in everyday life has not been completed. The most noticeable thing is that long distances are always indicated in miles - on signs on highways and on speed limit signs (the most common in cities is 30, which is 48 km/h).
Traffic is on the left side. For exceeding the speed limit by 20 kilometers per hour, there is not a warning, as in Russia, but a fine equal to 2 weeks’ salary, up to 1,000 pounds, and the second time, deprivation of your license.
I noticed an interesting feature that many drivers here, when stopping at a traffic light, can turn off the engine, apparently to save gasoline (it costs about 1.15-1.20 pounds per liter). Even bus drivers do this! And in Russia, drivers, on the contrary, are more likely to be afraid of breaking the starter by frequent use.
Jumping red lights is a very common phenomenon in the UK due to the inadequate setup of most traffic lights. They burn red for so long that almost no one can stand them. The traffic lights seem to have a button, but the button feels like a pure placebo.
As you know, the taps in the sinks are separate, but to be honest, this did not cause me any particular inconvenience: cold water is enough for brushing your teeth; for washing dishes, you still turn on the hot water separately and the cold water separately. In showers and bathrooms there are instantaneous water heaters with a button everywhere.
Many history and art museums in the country are free, including in London - the British Museum, the National Gallery, the Tate Gallery. But other attractions can be very expensive, for example, entrance to the Tower costs as much as 27 pounds. There is also a paid and very expensive entrance to cathedrals, including St. Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey in London, York Cathedral, or the Salisbury Cathedral that Russian agents love to watch.

<b>Total</b>
It’s difficult to calculate expenses by day, because I traveled a lot and flew around the islands. Overall, this country is cheaper to travel than France and the Netherlands and is about on par with Germany, provided you buy your train tickets in advance.
The country is undoubtedly interesting and worthy of a visit. It’s quite comfortable and pleasant to be there; if it weren’t for the need to get a visa every time, I would probably go there from time to time, just as I periodically go to Germany, France, and Spain.
