I visited Armenia twice with a gap of 9 years: in 2014 and 2023. The first time I hitchhiked everywhere, I saw not so many monasteries, but more landscapes. The country seemed cheap to me. Since then, Armenia has experienced a revolution in 2018, a war in 2020 and a massive wave of migration in 2022. Now this country no longer seems particularly cheap to me, although of course it does not compare with Western Europe.
Armenia is a small country, but very interesting and pleasant for tourism, since in a small area there is a huge number of diverse natural landscapes.

<b>Visa</b>
You can stay in Armenia without a visa for 180 days, and you can also very easily obtain a residence permit, without the need to look for a local employer. Thanks to this, Armenia became popular as a place for quick emigration. It is also potentially possible to apply for citizenship in three years if you learn the Armenian language (it is an Indo-European language, so the difficulty of learning it is average, easier than Georgian).
There are two airports in Armenia - Yerevan and Gyumri, but I have never flown to/from them. In principle, there are quite a lot of flights to Yerevan (there are even from Turkey, but not so many), and some low-cost airlines from Europe also fly there.
Itâ€™s not difficult to come from Georgia; buses from Tbilisi run frequently. There are at least three border crossings.
The border with Turkey is closed, although there is talk of opening.
The border with Azerbaijan is closed, despite plans to open transport corridors that were part of the 2020 war ceasefire agreement. It is currently impossible to travel to Nagorno-Karabakh, which still remains a self-proclaimed state, as Azerbaijan is blocking the road.
The border with Iran is basically open, you can go there, although the road is long.

The currency of Armenia is called the dram, 1 dollar = 380 drams in 2023. Surprisingly, in 2014 the rate was even slightly lower (400-410 per dollar), then for a long time it was around 500, and fell sharply in 2022, probably due to an influx of currency into the country along with a wave of migration. It seems that this is the only currency in post-Soviet countries that has grown rather than fallen in 10 years.
There are only dramas at ATMs.

<b>Accomodation</b>
I only lived in Yerevan. In this city, housing is relatively expensive - I had difficulty finding a decent apartment on airbnb for less than $50, hotels and hostels are also twice as expensive as in Tbilisi.
For traveling around the country, Yerevan is an obvious hub, since all transport is connected to it. You can consider other cities for living, but there will be little stuff in them - Yerevan is simply much larger than all other cities, while in Georgia Batumi and Kutaisi still have a certain weight.
If you want to live in a small town closer to nature, Armenia is good (as is Georgia, by the way). The resort town of Dilijan in the northeast enjoys some popularity.

<b>Food</b>
Shashlyk (kebab) in Armenia looks a little different than in Georgia - it is usually made from larger and less fatty pieces of pork. It costs 3000-4000 drams.

Khashlama is a basic classic dish of fried lamb with potatoes.

Tabbouleh salad is sold everywhere, which is somewhat different from the Arabic/Lebanese version. It is cheap - 700-1000 drams.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-armenia-830614_original.jpg" title=""/>
Kebab costs around 1200 drams.

Gata - plum pie.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-armenia-827442_original.jpg" title=""/>
The prices for groceries in the store seemed quite high to me in comparison with Georgia and especially Turkey. The choice is also more limited - imports are essentially only from one country.

<b>Transport</b>
Public transport in Armenia is represented almost exclusively by minibuses. I almost never used it, only to the immediate vicinity of Yerevan. I took day excursions to distant cities.
There are quite comfortable and fast trains from Yerevan to Gyumri.
Yerevan has one metro line, buses and trolleybuses. The fare is 100 drams, on some old trolleybuses - 50 drams. In principle, you can travel around the city quite efficiently by bus. There is also a minibus to the airport for 300 drams.
A taxi in the central part of Yerevan usually costs 1000-1200 drams through the Yandex application, to the airport about 2000-2500.

<b>Internet</b>
I bought a SIM card from the MTS operator right at the border, it cost 2800 drams ($7) for 15 gigabytes of traffic.

<b>What to see</b>
Yerevan is the capital. The city center was built in Soviet times according to a master plan. The northern part of the city is much higher than the central and southern parts, and from there there are good views of Ararat in clear weather.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-armenia-830976_original.jpg" title=""/>
Gyumri is the second largest city that has preserved its historical center.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-armenia-827990_original.jpg" title=""/>
The rest of the cities are very small, so people travel around Armenia mainly for mountain landscapes and monasteries, which perfectly complement them.

Etchmiadzin is the most important Armenian monastery in the suburbs of Yerevan, a UNESCO monument.

Geghard is also close to Yerevan, the second UNESCO monument.

Garni is a rare example of an entire Roman temple that has survived to this day.

Khor Virap is a monastery south of Yerevan, famous for the closest views of Ararat.

Tatev is the southernmost famous monastery. A cable car leads to it.

Haghpat and Sanahin are two UNESCO heritage monasteries, in the north near the city of Alaverdi.

Akhtala is also close to Alaverdi and the Georgian border.

The most beautiful mountain landscapes are in two parts of Armenia.
Firstly, the north (Lori and Tavush regions) - Lake Sevan and Debed Canyon. There are steep canyons here, similar to neighboring Georgia or Austria/northern Italy.

Secondly, the south (Vayots Dzor and Syunik region) - there are wider landscapes with meadows and fields, more like New Zealand.
