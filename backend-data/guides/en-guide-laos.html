So, an overview of another country: Laos. You may not know anything about this country and think that no one goes there, but in fact there are a lot of tourists there. Due to the fact that the country is small, apart from the main tourist places there are virtually no cities at all, visually it seems that there are many more tourists than in neighboring Thailand. Laos is still formally communist (as in China and Vietnam), but this is only manifested in the ubiquitous red flags with the hammer and sickle. There are almost no monuments to leaders and red banners with slogans, and economically there was never communism in Laos, because when the Reds came to power, there was no proletariat in the country who needed to throw off their chains, and the peasants were not enthusiastic about the confiscation of their bulls for the good of the fatherland. Laos is a rather poor and corrupt country in which most of the goods are imported, and the business is run by the Chinese and Thais.

<b>Entry</b>
Russian citizens do not need a visa for up to 15 days, but most tourists get one at the border for a month for 30-35 dollars. It is possible to travel all of Laos in 15 days, but it is somewhat tiring. I entered twice - to the south and to the north, and between that I rested and celebrated the New Year in Thailand. There is a lot of different unpleasant information about entering Laos, I will describe my impressions.
Entry from Cambodia in the very south. There is no city, you need to take a Stung Traeng-Don Det ticket, which includes a ferry to the island and a tuk-tuk from the highway to the ferry. Cambodians ask for two dollars for an exit stamp, but you can ignore them. The Laotians, despite the brand new sparkling terminal, are just as corrupt, asking for 2 dollars. I gave them 10,000 kip for two ($1.25), it worked.
Departure to Thailand Savannakhet - Mukdahan. Direct bus from bus station to bus station, 55 baht (in Lao kip it was a little more expensive). When leaving, I didn’t pay anything and didn’t ask, although I saw that either the Thais or the Laotians gave the border guard 10k kip or 40 baht.
Entry from Thailand Nong Khai - Vientiane. This is the most popular border crossing. I took a direct bus from Nong Khai for 60 baht all the way to Vientiane, this is the most economical option. From the train station you can walk to the border (or by tuktuk), but it’s a bit far from the city center. You can’t walk across the bridge; you have to pay 20 baht for the bus, and from the border to the center of Vientiane it costs 6,000 kip, i.e. The direct bus is better, but it is not recommended for those who need to obtain a visa at the border, because the bus may leave without you. To enter Laos they charged 5 baht (although according to the sign at the checkout I thought that I needed to pay 50 + 5, I gave 120 baht, but they only took 10), they give you a card that you need to put into the turnstile to get through.
Departure to Thailand Huai Xai - Chiang Khong. There are 10 kilometers to the border on the bridge from the city, and I bargained for 28,000 kip for two (all the remaining Laotian money). At six o'clock in the evening the crossing was empty, I had to give 40 baht to the border guard for leaving (the price tag is officially posted here, and it seems that you don't have to pay during the day), another 40 baht for a bus across the bridge (25 during the day). On the Thai side they ask for another 100 baht per tuk-tuk to the city (60 during the day), so we hitchhiked.

<b>Money</b>
$1 = 8200 Laotian kip. It’s surprising that on all sites where official exchange rates are shown, the rate is indicated at approximately 8150-8160, but in reality dollars can be sold at 8200. I also changed Thai baht a little at the very end, the difference between buying and selling is also small. Rates are good only in relatively large cities. For example, in a village on the tourist island of Don Det they give a maximum of 8,000. Fortunately, the $100 that I changed back in Cambodia was enough for the first four days until Pakse.
ATMs are extremely inconvenient, because, lik in Vietnam, there is a very small limit - around $100.

<b>Language</b>
In Laos it is very difficult to get off the tourist route (and there is not much point in doing so), so there are no particular problems with English. The Lao language is related to Thai and uses the same script. Available in Google Translate.
It’s interesting that in Laos, unlike all other Asian countries, children on the streets shout “Sabaidi” to you, not “Hello”

<b>Accomodation</b>
Hotels are quite normal and cost about the same as in Thailand and Cambodia. A room with air conditioning costs 80-90 thousand kip ($10-11). Without air conditioning it is not much cheaper (unlike Cambodia, where it is half the price), apparently because in Laos air conditioning is not needed everywhere. In the entire northern part I lived without it, and especially in Luang Prabang an extra blanket would be nice, because at night there is a terrible frost there, 12-15 degrees.
The biggest problem with housing is in Luang Prabang, because there is an unrealistic number of tourists and the demand for cheap housing exceeds supply - almost half of the hotels have no vacancies at all, others start from 120 thousand ($15). It was hard to find for 100k. This is the only city not on the sea where hotel prices are affected by the “high season”.
On the island of Don Det, an absolute record for the cost of hotel was set - 30,000 kip or about $3.6. For that kind of money you get a wooden bungalow with a not very comfortable bed, a mosquito net (which would be very useful in other more expensive hotels), two hammocks at the entrance and a shower attached to the side, which is heated by the sun during the day. There is no Internet, but wi-fi is available from a nearby restaurant (but I couldn’t buy a SIM card on this island). For unity with nature, a couple of days is normal, but there is almost no proper hotels on the island, and it is disproportionately expensive - 20 dollars.

<b>Transport</b>
Transport in Laos sucks. The country is sparsely populated, mostly along the Thai border. There are almost no cities, for the most part they are just villages along the highways, only with stone houses. There is little demand for transport from the local population, so 90% of passengers are tourists.
The Laotians are terrible perverts, who locate the bus station 10 kilometers from the city center. Imagine a city of three streets, then one street along the highway, and after 10 kilometers there is a bus station. There is no public transport. There are no traffic jams in Laos, and there is no artistic value in the cities (except Luang Prabang) for buses to ruin it. This is how they increase GDP - everyone pays the tuk-tuker a dollar, GDP grows.
There is usually one bus for locals, which leaves at 6 am, and everything later is for tourists. At the same time, a bus for locals and tourists costs the same or almost the same, and it often makes sense to buy a ticket from a travel agency. Let's look at different examples.
Don Det - Pakse/Tampatsak. 70,000 kip ($9) The nastiest section. It seems that there is a local bus at around 7 am, but you can only get off the island by boat, and at 7 am you will have to rent it for yourself, which will kill your savings. Tourists are taken out at 11 am and transferred to minibuses purely for tourists (the price without a boat is indicated as 60,000). To Champatsak and Pakse the price is equally extortionate - 70,000 (this is for 100 kilometers of travel), while in Champatsak they are dropped off near the ferry crossing across the Mekong , and then they demand another 20,000 (!) for the crossing, which is not included in the ticket. Europeans swallow and pay, reasoning, “Well, 2.5 euros isn’t much.” Apparently, they believe that in this way they are supporting the economy of Laos and saving poor Laotians from hunger, although in reality they are only allowing one greedy freak to cut off a monthly Laotian salary in three days, continuing to kick the bulldozer instead of raising some kind of production in Laos and services. However, Europeans do the same thing at home, handing out 1,000 euros a month to all sorts of idle people and refugees instead of giving them jobs.
Champatsak - Pakse. 20000 kip. At 7am the only local "bus" is essentially a truck with benches. But it helps to avoid predatory river crossings.
Pakse - Savannakhet. 40000 kip. Here there is no need to use a travel agency. In the city, a ticket will be sold for 70-80 thousand. Regular old rickety buses go there about once every hour and a half. The main problem is finding the bus station. Even the tuk-tuk driver did not immediately understand where to go until he consulted with his colleague. Apparently, it leaves from the south (although you go to Savannakhet to the north), I got into it at a small station (but with tickets) on the highway not far from the center, and then it also stops at the northern station.
Vientiane - Vang Vieng. 40000 kip. Only tourists go to Vang Vieng. You can take any bus going further north (but they are either early in the morning or late in the evening), but any travel agency will sell a tourist bus ticket for the same 40k for any time, which will save money on travel to the station.
Vang Vieng - Luang Prabang. 80000 kip. Drive 6 hours through the mountains. The road is so-so, there are some potholes. You need to buy it at the M-Mart store, in all other places it costs 90k.
Luang Prabang - Pakbeng - Huai Xai, motor boat. 110,000 kip for each leg of the journey. You need to take it at the pier, because the travel agency will charge you 300 thousand. More on this below.
Travel prices are approximately the same as on Thai buses, if you calculate the travel time (and I always estimate this way, and not per kilometer, because 100 kilometers along the German autobahn and 100 kilometers along a mountain serpentine with potholes is not the same). It’s a bit expensive just to get out of Don Det Island, however, in Thailand buses from Khao San are also expensive. By the way, if you want to go to Cambodia from this island, a ticket to Stung Treng (the nearest city, 70 km away) will cost as much as $18! In the opposite direction, I took it for $12 and then considered it a ripoff.
Public transport is available in Vientiane and Luang Prabang. There are several bus routes in Vientiane, the price depends on the route, and not on the distance: on intracity routes 2000 kip ($0.25), on suburban routes - 5000-6000, and the same for travel within the city. In Luang Prabang there are strange electric tuk-tuks, but the price seems to be indicated by the bus - 3-5 thousand, the route is fixed.
Tuk-tukers in Laos are just as brazen and expensive as those in Thailand, but they are difficult to avoid in some cases. The price depends on the number of people, that is, twice as expensive for two people. We can consider that 10,000 per person for a trip of 5 kilometers around the city is an acceptable price, but they will demand 25,000. It was interesting upon arrival in Luang Prabang. I slowly get out of the minibus and see that the Europeans have already boarded the tuk-tuk. I asked how much it cost - 20,000. Moreover, the road to the center is about 3 kilometers, you can walk there. I’m leaving the bus station, and a tuk-tuk pulls up at the exit and offers it for 10,000. That’s better, but for two, 20k is still a bit expensive for such a distance. On the street near the station, the third tuk-tuker agreed to 5,000.

<b>Food</b>
Food in Laos turned out to be very ok. Laotians know how to cook. Specialties: coconut curry, very small spicy pieces of meat ("laap") and rice, similar in consistency to Uzbek plov. And also classic banana pancakes with Nutella for tourists.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-laos-57523_original.jpg" title=""/>
A characteristic feature of Laos is that, unlike neighboring Thailand, the portions are large (especially in less touristic cities). While in Thailand the standard for two is three dishes for 35-40 baht, in Laos one dish for 15,000-20,000 kip is enough for two. 15,000 is the standard price for rice/noodles with meat, 20,000 is a little more sophisticated (for example, also with vegetables).
<i>Curry</i>

Retail in Laos is not very good - there is no 7-eleven, there is nothing to buy at night, all the stores have no price tags and resemble general stores in appearance and assortment. Most of them have nothing to buy except noodles (brought from Thailand) and chips (from there). Naturally, food prices are slightly higher than in Thailand, due to imports. Since there are no supermarkets, you won’t be able to buy cheap food on special offers. The only exception is Vientiane, there is even a chain of m-Mart stores there, similar to 7-11. There is also the only modern shopping center in the country with a food court and a cinema (which does not show premieres like Star Wars). The rest of the "supermarkets" are more like Soviet supermarkets.
Coffee. Coffee is grown in the south of Laos, and coffee is drunk everywhere here. Coffee is awesome if you take it diluted with milk and ice. For 10,000 ($1.25) in any city they make a large glass or just a bag with a hole for a straw. In its pure form it costs 5 thousand, but it’s too strong.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-laos-57830_original.jpg" title=""/>
Alcohol. In Laos, every fence has an advertisement for Beerlao beer, and even tourists wear T-shirts with its symbols. I tried it once, regular beer. It is not particularly cheap - 10,000 per bottle 0.6 (Even in Europe you can find a liter for 70-80c, and in Cambodia for 50c), although cheaper than in Thailand. But in Laos there is unbelievably cheap “whisky”. The simple fact is that when Vang Vieng was still a hangout place for drunken European youth, it was famous for its very strong cocktails, because Laotian whiskey is cheaper than Coca-Cola.

<b>Internet</b>
I went to the office of the operator Unitel in Pakse, and it was empty. For half an hour no one showed up, even if you took out all their computers. As a result, I bought a SIM card at a kiosk and activated it myself - you need to call number 109 (written on the card from which you take out the SIM card), there are English-speaking operators there, I was told to call 121 and press 1. After that, the Internet worked. A SIM card costs 10,000 kip ($1.25). Another 10,000 kip costs 270 megabytes per month, I bought this package twice. To top up, you need to buy a scratch card at the kiosk. A gigabyte for a month costs 50,000 kip, but I decided that I don’t need that much for two weeks. 3G speed is good, you can talk on Skype. There is coverage on the highways, along the shore of the Mekong, when you sail along it - in many places there is no coverage, in many places there is only 2G (but working), in Pakbeng and 3G.
Wi-fi is available in hotels, the speed is average.

<b>Entertainment</b>
Laotians love to exploit natural resources, sometimes going beyond the bounds of decency. It's okay to have a fee for entering a mountain or a waterfall - I can understand that something needs to be arranged there too, but charging a fee for crossing a bridge or for a stamp in a passport is quite blatant.
Passage from Don Det Island to Don Khone Island - 35,000 kip. You can see the only train in Laos and the rapids on the Mekong.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-laos-58764_original.jpg" title=""/>
"Tubing" is a Laotian invention. This is essentially floating in the river on a life preserver with a beer. On 4000 islands it costs 10,000 kip, but in Vang Vieng, where it came from, it’s already 55,000 - a bit expensive.
Wat Phu is the only Khmer temple in Laos, entrance 50,000 kip, another 10,000 cost to rent a bike to get there about 8 km (tuk-tuk wants 80,000 round trip)
<img alt="" src="images/guide-laos-58468_original.jpg" title=""/>
Bolaven plateau. I took a tour to Pakse for 150,000 kip (about $19), which was a reasonable price. In a day you travel around three waterfalls, four villages and a small coffee plantation. Quite an interesting and relaxed trip.
Climbing the triumphal arch in Vientiane - 3000 kip.
I didn’t go to the Golden Stupa for 5000, it’s small and you can see it well from the outside.
Buddha Sculpture Park near Vientiane - 5000 kip. Interesting when combined with a visit to the same author's later park across the river in Thailand.
Climbing the mountain near Vang Vieng - 10,000 kip. Tubing there costs 55,000, kayak for half a day 70,000, for the whole day 100,000
Mountain in the center of Luang Prabang - 20,000 kip. There are two more temples with paid entrance for the same amount; I went there in the evening, when there were no ticket sellers.
The feeding ceremony of the monks in Luang Prabang, oddly enough, is free - a flaw of the Laotians. A strange sight, similar to a Russian opposition rally, when 10 people are walking down the street, and another 100 around are taking pictures.

<img alt="" src="images/guide-laos-59293_original.jpg" title=""/>
Cruising along the Mekong on a “slow boat” is definitely a worthwhile experience. 220,000 kip ($27) for two days of leisurely contemplation of the river and low mountains around. The boat is quite comfortable, with soft car seats. The speed is 15-20 kilometers per hour, there is no shaking. 95% of tourists take this boat in the opposite direction - from Thailand to Luang Prabang, so if you get on in Luang Prabang, the boat will be half empty. You just need to stock up on food, because on the boat itself there is only coffee and noodles.
You can also get to the border with northern Thailand in 7 hours by speed boat for 350,000 kip (I wouldn’t dare, it’s very scary) or in 110,000 and 17 hours by bus along a poor mountain road.

<b>Other</b>
Laundry costs the same as everywhere else - one dollar per kilogram.
In Laos, the cheapest condoms in the world are “Number One”, a pack of three for 2000 kip, that is, 12 pieces for $1. Interestingly, they say "Made in Malaysia".

<b>Results</b>
Over 16 days, the cost was $498, about $31 per day.

Travel costs have increased due to long distances. Food costs are low because the portions are large and there is no temptation to buy treats at the store.

Overall I liked Laos. Pros: cheap accommodation, food, large portions, coffee, not very hot climate, beautiful places that are relatively accessible. Cons: the country is one continuous village, and at the same time there are too many tourists. If in Thailand you see a crowd of tourists only from afar, then in Laos it is almost impossible to avoid it, which is why you sometimes spend extra money, or you need to carefully look for a place to eat.
