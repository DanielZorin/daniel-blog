Sit back, this is going to be my longest review yet. A large country - a detailed analysis. I spent three months in India and was essentially everywhere except the northeastern states and islands.

<b>Money</b>
Indian currency is called rupee. A rupee is approximately equal to the Russian ruble, $1 = 65 rupees.
You can withdraw a maximum of 10,000 rupees at a time (about $150) from an ATM. Most ATMs charge a fee of Rs 200, but at least State Bank of India and Yes! There is no bank commission. I almost always rent from the State Bank because they usually give out 500 bills, which is much better than 2000 bills.
In 2016, an expropriation reform took place: 500 and 1000 rupees bills were taken out of circulation without warning, just like in the USSR in 1991. You could deposit money into a bank account or exchange it in cash, but no more than ~5000 per day. The government naively hoped that underground millionaires and drug lords would go to repent and beg for forgiveness, but it is unlikely that they kept suitcases of rupees at home, but rather dollars or bitcoins. The smartest hired beggars for 10 rupees to stand in lines at banks and exchange 5,000 each. In the end, everyone got into trouble because India is not Switzerland, here cards are not accepted for payment almost anywhere, even in a few supermarkets Always. Instead of cards, however, there is a payment system Pay TM (similar to the Russian Qiwi), it is linked to the phone, and through it you can pay in many shops, restaurants and even stalls. This system is of no use to foreigners, because you cannot top up your Pay TM account with a foreign credit card, so you will still have to deposit it in cash. Foreign credit cards are accepted only at McDonald's and Marriott.
Simultaneously with the withdrawal of 500 and 1000, a new 2000 bill was introduced. Can you imagine what will happen if you have 50, 100 bills, and then only 2000, and ATMs give out 2000 each? That's right, it will be very difficult to exchange it. At the beginning of 2017, a new type of 500 banknotes was introduced, with them it became easier to change five hundred bills without any problems, since a typical bill in a restaurant will be at least 200-300. 2000 is still accepted reluctantly; for some reason hotels always have no change from it. The best place to exchange them is at Burger King.
On the other hand, little things are also always missing. Notes of 10 rupees are popular, and most prices are rounded to 10, and coins of 1-2-5 rupees are not enough. In stores they may give you candy and chewing gum for change; on buses they may round up to 5 or 10.


<b>Language</b>
The language of international communication in India is English, more or less educated people know it, less educated people at least know numbers. There are not many people who are completely uneducated if you travel around large or tourist cities.
Hindi is popular in the northern half of the country. If you listen to Hindi, for example, watch a movie with subtitles, you will notice that they often insert words and even entire phrases in English into Hindi. I only learned the alphabet from Hindi (called “Devanagari”), more or less so that I could read the signs on the buses. Buses are essentially the only place where there may not be signs in English. Menus in restaurants are in English 99% of the time (only a couple of times in the slums I saw them in Hindi/Marathi), signs are in English, inscriptions on goods in stores are in English.
In addition to Hindi, in the northern half of the country there are other languages of the Indo-Aryan group: Punjabi, Marathi (in Mumbai), Bengali (in Kolkata), Odia (in Orissa). The letters are slightly different, but similar to those in Hindi (except for the Odia alphabet).
In the southern part of the country, the languages Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam are not at all similar to Hindi, they are from a completely different group, and their letters are also completely different, I couldn’t master these - there are too many of them.
In the state of Goa, the Konkani language is written in the Latin alphabet, where almost all buses are signed only in it or in Latin and Devanagari.


<b>Transport</b>
It is wise to use airplanes to travel long distances; in India there are low-cost airlines whose prices are comparable to 2-3 class trains for long journeys.
Now about the main thing: trains. The advantages of trains are obvious: they are more comfortable than buses, the stations are usually in the city center, the schedule is on the Internet, you can sleep comfortably in them at night, with their help you can lay out successive routes across cities (planes do not always fly directly between neighboring cities, there may be a transfer in hub). The disadvantages in India are lack of punctuality and some difficulties in purchasing tickets.
I'll start with (im)punctuality. This is the problem. I have traveled by train more than 20 times, and never (!) has a train deviated from the schedule by less than half an hour. Once he arrived on time (Goa-Mumbai), but departed about 45 minutes late. Once he arrived half an hour earlier (Chennai-Bangalore), arriving at 4-30 am instead of 5. Most trains are late by at least an hour, the biggest delay was 5 hours (Agra-Khajuraho). This means you can't plan any transfers unless you don't mind losing your ticket. If you board not at the initial station, but at an intermediate one, you can safely add an hour to the departure time. But what if he does arrive on time? For this there is a magical website <a href="https://enquiry.indianrail.gov.in/mntes/">https://enquiry.indianrail.gov.in/mntes/</a>, where you can see where is your train in real time. A really indispensable thing, because they also indicate the platform at which he arrives, and announcements at the station may be illegible or absent altogether. This site is also useful if you are already driving and want to know when to get off. No one announces stops on the train, and the conductor, unlike Russia, will not wake you up at 5 am in front of your station. There are no conductors there at all, or rather there is one per ten cars, who checks tickets once and is never seen again.
<i>The site so touchingly promises that after a while the train will catch up with the schedule, although in reality it will only be more late</i>
<img alt="" src="images/guide-india2-124752_original.png" title=""/>
All of the above applies to trains with reserved seats. There are other trains with only general rogue cars; you won’t find them on the ticket booking website (after all, you don’t need to book a ticket for them in advance), only on the website with timetables. I have never ridden one of these, because they mostly travel short distances, and only occasionally between different regions. Such trains have even worse schedule compliance.
Now about the tickets. There are many different classes on Indian trains, in practice you may encounter the following:
1AC - first class with air conditioning. I have never ridden in one of these, there are very few of them. In terms of configuration, this is an analogue of a Russian coupe (for four with doors)
2AC - second class to air conditioning. I rode in it once. In terms of configuration - like a Russian reserved seat. Four seats in the compartment + two on the side.
3AC - third class with air conditioning. I've ridden it several times, there are quite a lot of them and the price is low. There are three tiers in the compartment, two on the side places.
<i>Car 3AC</i>
<img alt="" src="images/guide-india2-120966_original.jpg" title=""/>
SL - "sleeper", reserved seat without air conditioning. The configuration is similar to 3AC, with fans hanging on the ceiling. They are the most common car and form the bulk of the train on most trains, although there are trains consisting entirely of 3ACs. I always tried to take the top shelves, they are the most convenient: you can immediately climb up there, and no one will bother you. The lower one will have to be shared with neighbors, and the middle one is the most useless: it is lowered only at night, because otherwise you cannot sit on the lower one.
2S is a seated carriage without air conditioning. This class is found on daytime trains that run between neighboring regions. In appearance, it can be either an electric train with benches or an SL class car. The seats are fixed, so there should be no crowding. If you get into a sleeper, then there is a chance to climb onto the third shelf - consider yourself winning the jackpot, you can stretch out and ride lying down.
CC/EC - seated carriages with air conditioning. They are rare. EC is the most elite, the price will be more expensive than even 2A.
There is also “General Class”, usually the first and/or last car in the train. Seats are not reserved there; you can buy them just before departure, if you manage to squeeze in, of course. In fact, on some trains there is no crowding, and then the General may not be so bad, but it is better to take at least a sleeper, since it still costs very little.
If you are not very squeamish, then the trains are quite comfortable. Yes, the toilets are a bit cramped, like in the old Russian reserved seats. Yes, it can get a little hot during the day without air conditioning. But stretching out on the shelf is quite nice. By the way, even in sleeper and 2S cars there are sockets in each compartment, you can sit with a laptop. There is no crushing, shoving with elbows, no storming of carriages (except General, but it can be avoided).
<i>A special case - a seated carriage on the Shimla-Kalka mountain narrow gauge railway</i>
<img alt="" src="images/guide-india2-120329_original.jpg" title=""/>
These are the approximate prices. 2S: 1 km = 0.5 rupees. SL: 1 km = 0.7-1 rupees. The shorter the distance, the more expensive per kilometer. 3AC is two to three times more expensive than a sleeper, 2AC is 30 percent more expensive than 3AC, 1AC is very expensive, almost twice as expensive as 2AC. For clarity, if Moscow and St. Petersburg were in India (mind me!), then the ticket would cost approximately this:
- in a seated carriage 300 rubles
- in a sleeper 450 rubles
- at 3AC 1200 rubles
- in 2AC 1600 rubles
- in 1AC 3000 rubles
- in reality, a reserved seat in Russia costs from 1000 to 2000 rubles
- coupe from 2500 to 5000 rubles
And in India, the train from Moscow to St. Petersburg would not take 7-8 hours, but 12-14, plus a delay.

The main problem of Indian railways, oddly enough, is that there are few trains. Yes, the overall numbers are quite large, but don’t forget about the population! Here, for example, are tickets from Bangalore to Hyderabad, two neighboring large cities at a distance of about 400 kilometers:
<img alt="" src="images/guide-india2-124578_original.png" title=""/>
Only 7 trains per day! Of these, only two are straight, the rest are passing. Two, for example, go all the way to Delhi. The first of the trains, by the way, covers 400 kilometers in almost 20 hours. And this is between cities the size of Moscow and St. Petersburg! In China, trains would run every half hour (and the travel time would be two hours). So it's no surprise that train tickets are selling out and purchasing them before departure can be difficult. Now let's figure out how.
You can, of course, buy a ticket at the station at the ticket office, but this is a gesture of despair. There are queues there, and Indians don’t know how to stand in queues, someone is always pushing ahead, you’ll have to jostle your elbows at the window. Besides, this is India, you can’t say: “I have a ticket to Mumbai tomorrow at 20:15, sleeper class.” First you need to push your way to the window and take a special form there; without it they won’t talk to you. In the application you need to write the train number, your name and age (although you still need to give a passport), home address, telephone number, mother's maiden name and the name of your favorite pet. If you don’t fill it in, they may send you to finish it. And only then do you have to push your way to the cash register with this piece of paper. This may take a couple of hours. In general, you need to buy tickets online.
First, you need to register on the official website <a href="https://www.irctc.co.in/eticketing/loginHome.jsf">irctc.co.in</a>: tickets are sold only there, on other sites you will still need to log in to this site at the end. It's not difficult, but you need to verify your email and mobile phone, and only Indian phones are accepted. If you don’t have it, you can send them a scan of your passport to support; my account was approved about a week later. If you have a SIM card, then everything is done instantly.
The interface of the official website is terrible. Besides the grammatical errors and googly-eyed design that can be survivable, there are a couple of major functionality issues. Firstly, there may be several train stations in one city, and you cannot simply search for tickets from Delhi, you need to enter a specific station, and they are not even divided by train directions. Secondly, you are shown a list of trains in the selected direction, on the right in the extreme column is a list of classes that are on this train. You need to click on a specific class, then the page will reload and you will be shown whether there are tickets available and how many. If there are a lot of trains, it will take a long time to click. The way out of this is simple: you need to look for tickets on the website makemytrip.com, there is a good interface, you can display a grid by dates and by classes, you can immediately see where there are how many tickets, and you can search for the whole city. And you can already buy on irctc, knowing which train you need. However, there may also be problems with this: the interface that accepts foreign credit cards for payment periodically glitches, especially in the morning, when tatkal tickets are posted (see below). If it was glitchy, I bought through cleartrip.com. This site does not have a very user-friendly interface, but the commission is lower than on makemytrip - only 20-40 rupees for the entire booking, plus less than 2% for paying by credit card. On the official website there is a 4% commission for paying with a foreign credit card, so if your ticket is expensive, it may be even cheaper through cleartrip.
From one account you can buy only six tickets per month, or rather six reservations: the purchase of seats on one train for several people is considered one reservation.
With an electronic ticket you can board the train and show the ticket to the ticket inspector on your phone screen.
If there are tickets, you will see the status AVL = available on the website. If there is still a month before departure, then most likely it will be so, and you will happily buy a ticket. I did just that, being in Malaysia, I bought several tickets well in advance without any problems.
If there is less than a week left before departure, then most likely the status will be WL = wait list, which means that there are no tickets. Cunning Indians have come up with a whole system for this situation. Here in Russia, if there are no tickets, then all you have to do is press F5 in the hope that someone will hand over their ticket. But in Russia there is no such competition for tickets, unless we are talking about holidays. In India, you can get on the waiting list, and if someone returns a ticket, it will automatically go to you. More precisely, everything is still more cunning. First, the status of tickets is AVL, let's say there are 500 such tickets. When they run out, tickets with the status RAC = reservation against cancellation begin to be sold. For example, admins know that on average 20% of tickets are surrendered, so 100 RAC tickets are sold. If you have an RAC ticket, you will be allowed on the train and must find a seat, but it is not guaranteed that the whole thing, there may be one for two. So if you are traveling together and are not afraid to sleep in one bed, then you can safely take the RAC. In practice, RAC almost always turns into a full-fledged seat, because seats are freed up not only due to the tickets returned, there are also special quotas for all sorts of military personnel and officials, who also disappear the day before departure and go to the holders of RAC tickets.
If the RAC tickets are over, WL begins. You pay and get in line and hope that a lot of people will turn in their tickets and your status will turn into at least RAC. If it doesn’t work out, the money will be returned to you (theoretically, you can even buy a WL ticket for cash, but then you also have to return it in cash and in a short time, and it will be returned to the card automatically). It's a lottery and I don't think it's worth playing unless it's your last chance. What if tickets don't appear? You still have to go, which means you should have already had a plan B (for example, a ticket for another date), one of your plans will fall through, and you won’t be able to get a full refund for the tickets right before departure. So read on.
All trains have a special quota called "tatkal". These tickets go on sale the day before departure at exactly 10 am (sleeper and 2S) and 11 am (3AC, 2AC, 1AC) and cost 100-200 rupees more than usual. The cleartrip website does not work until 11:30, you can only buy a ticket on the official one, and foreign credit cards simply did not work for me at that time. The only time I tried to buy a ticket this way, all 300 tatkal tickets disappeared from sale in about 2 minutes, so there’s really no point in hoping for tatkal tickets, although once I did buy a ticket for a less popular train using this quota.
There is another lifesaver called the “tourist quota”. Yes, you, as a foreigner, are privileged on the railway almost like a Brahmin official! The pitfall is that with this quota you cannot buy a ticket on the Internet, only in person, only hardcore. And not everywhere, but only at special ticket offices, which are only available in some of the largest cities. I've been in two of these. In Kolkata, it’s not at the station at all, but in the city center, I sat there for two hours, because Bangladeshis are also considered tourists and buy tickets at this ticket office. But there they call you by number, you don’t have to jostle. In Bangalore, this ticket office is on par with the regular ones; all sorts of people try to go there and buy tickets. I haven’t found a complete official list of cash registers; it’s easy to google posts on forums with partial lists. Another pitfall is that only a small proportion of trains have quota seats for tourists. Which ones, however, can still be viewed on the Internet, on the third official website: <a href="https://indiarailinfo.com">https://indiarailinfo.com</a>. You need to install a plugin for Chrome, otherwise the number of available places will not be loaded.
What to do if nothing helps? Here I see several options:
- Look for another date/time if your schedule is tight. If you travel less than 400-500 kilometers, there are often daytime seated class 2S trains, in which tickets are usually available even the day before departure
- Go to General class
- Buy a General class ticket and try to negotiate with the conductor so that for an additional fee he can transfer you to a sleeper for at least part of the journey
- Go by bus

Buses are local transport. They travel within one state or to a neighboring one. Buses are divided into two types: public and private. State-owned companies are called [name of state] State Road Transport Corporation (SRTC), these companies often have websites where you can view schedules, sometimes even buy tickets online. All these buses are without air conditioning, quite old, cramped, but with open windows. There is no smoking inside, so you can go. Some passengers travel standing, so it is better to take care not to be one of them. In the main directions, buses usually run at least once every half hour, or even more often, so traveling 100-200 kilometers is not a problem.
It’s not clear with private buses. If you enter bus from [Indian city 1] to [Indian city 2] into Google, the first link will usually be the site redbus.in, where some kind of schedule is even indicated, but all these buses, which supposedly should have air conditioning, but in the night ones there are even almost sleeping places; they depart not from bus stations, but from where it is unclear. Apparently, from the company's office somewhere in the city. In Amritsar, near my hotel, there were just a few such offices, and in the evening there were also buses that looked more decent than government ones. I haven’t seen them anywhere in other cities, so it’s unclear how to use this type of transport. Unless you buy a ticket through a travel agency, which is sometimes found even in non-tourist cities, but then you will probably overpay significantly, given that these buses are already more expensive than even class 3A trains.
The quality of roads in India is variable. The main routes between cities are in good condition, but as soon as the bus enters any city, all hell breaks loose. It’s especially visible after rain, then it’s reminiscent of apocalyptic pictures from demotivational books about Russian roads.
The average bus speed is higher than in Indonesia. I would estimate it at 40 kilometers per hour, although on a bad road like Nashik-Vapi it could be 20.

<b>Local transport</b>
As of August 2017, India has eight metros in the following cities: Delhi, Gurgaon, Kolkata, Jaipur, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Cochin. I've ridden everyone. Their usefulness varies. Delhi has the largest network of lines (probably larger than all the others combined), you can get everywhere, incl. to the airport. The Gurgaon Metro is a ring of several stations made for show off in a wealthy suburb of Delhi. Recently it has actually connected with the yellow line of the Delhi Metro. Kolkata has one line through the central areas. In Jaipur, the line is a little short of reaching the center; two stops in the very center are being completed. In Mumbai, a metro line connects two train lines somewhere in the distant outskirts, but by metro you can get almost to the airport itself. Mumbai also has a monorail line, 80% of which goes through fields, industrial areas and a couple of slums. It seems like they want to pull it to the center, otherwise it’s somehow completely strange. In Bangalore, two lines intersecting near the station are a useful system. In Chennai, there are one and a half unfinished lines, God knows where, with trains every 20 minutes, of which not all reach the final station. In Cochin, the metro was opened a week before my arrival, it was a stump on the outskirts, but it seems they were talking about opening a second section of the line, passing through the center, in 2-3 months.
Mumbai and Chennai have a developed system of commuter trains, you can call it S-bahn, because trains run every 5-10 minutes. In these cities, this is the most convenient method of transportation. Unlike the metro, there is no security check at all on trains (that's where the trap for terrorists is!), and there are no turnstiles either. They never checked my tickets to either Mumbai or Chennai, although I went 20 times and always bought them. Well, why not buy when they cost 5-10 rupees, it’s just inconvenient to get in line at some stations. By the way, there are first class tickets, which are 15-20 times more expensive than regular ones. The first class carriage is no different from the second, except for the sign at the entrance, but there are much fewer people there. For locals there are special savings cards that can be used to pay for tickets at the machine. Sometimes a cashier sits near the machine and sells tickets for cash, debiting from his card.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-india2-122351_original.jpg" title=""/>
Buses run in most cities. In the more decent ones (Delhi, Chandigarh, Tiruchirappalli, Hyderabad) they have numbers, and the routes are sometimes even marked on Google maps, although the regularity is unpredictable. In worse cities (Cochin, Calcutta), all or some of the buses do not have numbers, only the direction is indicated on the windshield. In Kolkata, I traveled by simply taking a bus going in the right direction and getting off if it turned off. In the poorest cities (Agra, Varanasi, etc.) there are no buses at all, instead there are pick-up minibuses or collective tuk-tuks. In this case, it is almost impossible to avoid a taxi.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-india2-124059_original.jpg" title=""/>
<img alt="" src="images/guide-india2-122452_original.jpg" title=""/>
Taxis in India are in 90% of cases tuk-tuks, which are called “rickshaws” or “autos” here. Pedicabs are found in small towns and only in the northern half of the country. In Calcutta there are also pedestrian rickshaws, they are actually some kind of game, what’s funny is unclear: the pedicabs cost the same, but they still go faster than a pedestrian. In Kolkata and central Mumbai there are black and yellow taxis instead of tuk-tuks, but further away from central Mumbai there are the same tuk-tuks.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-india2-121539_original.jpg" title=""/>
In theory, there are taxi cars, but they are only for the rich, so they don’t just pick up passengers on the street. If you live in a five-star hotel, they will call you.
In theory, tuk-tuks have meters, at least in the main cities, but I only managed to ride a meter once, in Mumbai. According to the meter, it should be approximately 10-12 rupees per kilometer, in fact you will have to pay one and a half to two times more, at least. The impudence of tuk-tukers varies from place to place. In Delhi they seem to be the most accommodating, I easily negotiated for one and a half meters. In Chennai they wanted three times as much, so I traveled by buses and trains. In tourist places everything is usually bad in this regard.
There is also such a thing as Uber. This app works in major cities, the price is about the same as what you can negotiate with a tuk-tuk after haggling, but Uber has decent cars with air conditioning. Uber is especially useful if you need to travel a long distance (10 kilometers), then it will definitely be cheaper than a tuk-tuk.
There is also an Indian alternative to Uber - the Ola Cabs app. I tried to use it, but it didn't work. Theoretically, you can call a tuk-tuk through it, but when I did this, the tuk-tuk did not come to me both times (although the order is immediately marked as accepted in the application). By car, Ola Cabs turns out to be more expensive than Uber.

<b>Housing</b>
In India, like in China, there is a law that requires a hotel to have a special license to serve foreigners. Unlike China, in India this law is observed very strictly, and you will never get into the cheapest housing for locals. However, the number of hotels with a license and their prices vary greatly. Let's say, in Bangalore and Hyderabad I was accommodated in hotels near the station without any problems, but in Ahmedabad they refused me all but the most expensive one with rooms starting from 1000 rupees. The next day, however, I stayed in another area for 500. It was much worse in Shimla and Kolkata: in the first I had to pay more than 1000, in the second - 1500 (the most expensive accommodation of the entire trip), although in Kolkata there may have been a problem Another thing is that I arrived in the evening, and all the cheap rooms were occupied. Yes, if the hotel does not have a license, they will tell you that there are no rooms: “Full”.
Interesting features of check-in: often, especially near train stations, rooms are rented out for exactly 24 hours from the moment of check-in. On the one hand, if you arrive by bus in the evening, this is convenient: then you don’t have to check out until the evening. On the other hand, if you arrive by night train at 5 am, then you have to get up at 5 am to check out. And in the city of Puri there is an enchanting feature: in all hotels, check-out is at 8 am! Simply because it is necessary.
On average, a double room with air conditioning costs 800 rupees, a single room without air conditioning - 400-500, if you look hard enough, then 350. In some relatively small tourist cities there may be an excess supply, so you can find it cheaper, for example, in Jodhpur I only lived for 180 rupees in a quite good room.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-india2-127998_original.jpg" title=""/>
The quality of housing does not always correlate with price. For example, in the city of Gaya, for 800 rupees, we stayed in a room with air conditioning, which was terrible: gloomy, dirty, shabby. The next day we moved to a hotel exactly opposite for the same price, but with clean and comfortable rooms, also with air conditioning.
There is almost no hot water anywhere, boilers are a rarity. Sometimes there seems to be hot water, but only from the tap (not from the shower), you need to stir it in a bucket, just like in Indonesia. Wi-fi is also not always available.


Ooh, we have a problem. In LiveJournal the maximum size of a post is 64 kilobytes of text, but here it turned out to be almost 90. Therefore, I had to split the text into two parts. To be continued.
