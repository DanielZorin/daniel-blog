I have been to southern, eastern and northern Africa. I wanted to take a look at western and central Africa. The problem is that visas to many countries must be obtained through embassies, which I did not have time for. But there is one country in central Africa, which is quite large and interesting, and on the way, and planes fly there relatively often, and a visa can be obtained remotely. This is Cameroon - a rather non-trivial destination.

<b>Visa</b>
Recently, a visa to Cameroon can be obtained remotely on the website <a href="https://www.evisacam.cm/">https://www.evisacam.cm/</a>. There is a tourist visa for 90 days and a transit visa for 5 days. A tourist visa costs 159 euros, and a transit visa is free (the website says that each visa should also have a service fee of 69 euros, but in fact there is none). So I got a transit visa: I attached a scan of my passport, a yellow fever vaccination certificate, photoshopped tickets Senegal - Cameroon - Ethiopia and a visa to Ethiopia (which I already had at that time). They also asked me for a scan of my internal passport and registration (visa applications are processed at the consulate in Moscow). In total, it took a week to get a visa. Upon arrival, you first need to go to a separate room with the sign eVisa, where they print out the visa and stick it in your passport. 

<b>Base</b>
European sockets. 
The main language is French, but there is a region where they speak English - along the border with Nigeria. In the 19th century, Cameroon was a German colony, after 1918 it was divided between Britain and France. Britain received a narrow strip, which was governed from Nigeria. After independence, part of British Cameroon joined Nigeria, and part (closer to the sea) - Cameroon. But there is still a sluggish conflict over independence/extended autonomy of the English-speaking region, and it is not recommended to travel to most of it. 
The currency of Cameroon is called the CFA franc (Central African franc). This currency is used in several countries at once: Cameroon, Gabon, Chad, CAR, Republic of Congo and Equatorial Guinea. The rate is tied to the euro. 
$1 ~ 600 XAF. There are banknotes of 10,000, 5,000, 2,000, 1,000, 500, and coins of 100 and 50. There is a huge problem with change, almost no one has change for less than 500, or even less than 1,000, even in large stores they give cookies and chewing gum as change.

<b>Transport</b>
There are trains in Cameroon, and they are pretty good! Every day there is a train between the two main cities of Douala and Yaounde. It leaves Douala at 6:30, and back from Yaounde at 17:00. The journey takes about 5 hours, which is faster than a bus (although it is only 200-250 kilometers). There are a couple of slower and cheaper trains on the same route. A ticket from Douala to Yaounde on the fast train costs 6,000 francs ($10) in premium class and 9,000 in first class. On the slow train it's 3,000.
I wanted to go on this train to Yaounde, but there were no tickets left before departure. And I was too lazy to buy them on the website in advance, since there is no card payment, only by phone number through the local payment system. When I was going back, I came to the station an hour and a half before departure and had already successfully bought a ticket.
There is also a night train from Yaounde further north to Ngaoundere, every day. A berth costs about $40.

From Douala, instead of the train, I went by bus. To the best of my modest knowledge of French, I explained to the motorcycle taxi driver where I needed to go, and he took me to the Finexs bus station. In Douala it is right in the center, and in Yaounde on the outskirts. From there, buses leave every 15-30 minutes, at the ticket office they didn’t even ask me about the time, they gave me the closest one (which wasn’t full yet). There is a VIP bus for 7,000 francs ($12) and a regular one for 4,000. I took the VIP because the line at the ticket office was half as long (and I stood in it for about 20 minutes), but in theory the regular one should also go without stops. The VIP bus has wide seats, but no power outlets. And the windows are tinted, which is why I can’t take pictures. When I was driving to Limbe on the coast, where the bus station in Douala is located, I didn’t understand. I found the station on the other side of the river in the Bonaberi area, and went there by taxi. The taxi driver advised me to take a shared taxi instead of a bus/minibus, the parking lot of which was not far from the bus station (but I wouldn’t have found it with the naked eye, there was just one car parked on the side of the road). A shared taxi to Limbe costs 3,000 francs ($5) and takes 1.5-2 hours (yes, only 70 kilometers). When I was driving back, the taxi driver went to the center of Douala, I got off at a convenient intersection. So there is a shared taxi stand to Limbe somewhere in the center.

What surprised me was the seemingly complete lack of public transport in Douala and Yaounde, although these are cities with a population of millions. At least, I did not see any buses or minibuses there, which are so ubiquitous in Kenya or Ethiopia. Only on the outskirts, but they were probably intercity ones. I suspect that some taxis and cars are used as public transport.
I called a taxi through the Yango app (Yandex taxi), or caught a motorcycle taxi on the street a couple of times. A short trip costs ~1000 francs ($1.5), to the airport - ~2000 francs. There is also a local Gozem app, it also has motorcycle taxis (Yandex has them in theory, but in fact, they do not). Interestingly, I had a card linked to Yango, because of this it showed me that there were no available drivers. The thing is that none or almost none of the drivers accept payment by card, only cash or by phone number through local payment systems MoMo and Orange Money (similar to Kenyan M-Pesa)

<b>Accommodation</b>
I only lived in Douala. I booked a hotel through booking, it cost about $30 a day - more than on my entire previous trip. The room was good, with a bathroom and air conditioning. There were cheaper hotels, but far from the center. In general, even on booking, there is a lot of accommodation in Douala, and there are still a lot of hotels that are not on booking. I think it is not a problem to find accommodation on the spot when traveling around the country.

<b>Food</b>
The food in Cameroon is very interesting and unusual. I can't say that it is very tasty, but it is definitely absolutely not like anything I have tried in other parts of the world.
The main dish is called ndole. It is in the center - it is boiled leaves of the plant of the same name (ndole), which grows in central Africa. You can cook meat or fish in them. On the sides, there is an unusual side dish called "miondo" - this is a specially fermented cassava, the texture is smooth, as if it were al dente pasta, and not a potato analogue.

The second epic dish is called Eru. It is made from the leaves of the Eru plant, in which shrimp, meat, cow skin or snails are cooked. Yes, snails are popular here, like in France. The side dish on the right is called "garri", this is a sticky porridge made from the same cassava.

There are a lot of restaurants, finding food is not a problem. Prices are around $5 per dish:

There are also roadside eateries, the prices are much lower there. Something like this:

I often ate kebabs, they cost 100 francs (1/6 of a dollar).

There are supermarkets in Cameroon, like Carrefour, where you can even buy jamon.

And once on the street in Douala I came across a mangosteen for sale! The only place in Africa where I found them.

<b>Internet</b>
I bought an MTN SIM card at the airport, it was not cheap - 5000 for the SIM card itself, and another 3000 francs ($5) for a 3GB package for a week. Most likely, you can buy the SIM card itself in the city much cheaper, but the packages are still twice as expensive as in East Africa.

<b>What to see</b>
Douala is the largest city in Cameroon. International flights mainly arrive here (although there are some to the capital too). It's a pretty harsh city, it's hard to walk, since all the sidewalks are occupied by cars. I was surprised by the huge number of restaurants and nightclubs, I have never seen so many restaurants anywhere else in Africa, except for South Africa and Zanzibar.

Yaounde is the capital. The city is more pleasant than Douala, although there are also some untidy places. It is located on the hills, so there are many beautiful views.

Limbe is a city on the ocean, and also the safest city in the English-speaking part of Cameroon. Nearby is Mount Cameroon - one of the highest points in Africa. You can get closer to it in the city of Buea, from where they even organize climbing.

There are several national parks in Cameroon. The most famous are Dja (in the southeast) and Waza (in the very north). There is very little information about them, since backpackers have not yet mastered Cameroon.

<b>Expenses</b>
Four days in Cameroon are significantly more expensive than in any country in East Africa. Here, the hotel, food, and communications are more expensive, and there is always rounding up due to the lack of change.
