Turkey is one of the most touristic countries in the world. I was there a couple of times as a child at resorts, then in 2013 I went to Istanbul, and somehow I kept putting off studying this country in detail - well, it's close, visa-free, cheap to fly, I can always make it. So for quite a long time, this very culturally significant country remained for me almost a blank spot on the world map. And then it turned out that at the end of 2021-2022 I went there twice as a tourist, and then got a residence permit and lived there for two and a half years. Turkey turned out to be an interesting and unusual country. Although millions of tourists come there, most of the country lives completely separately from this. I was struck by the almost complete absence of tourists in many, even very famous attractions. The atmosphere reminded me most of China - no one knows a word of English, many things are not designed for foreigners, architecture, city planning, attitude to historical heritage, economic policy, censorship and the fight against dissent - parallels can be drawn everywhere. <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945083222_e876c69ef9_o.png" title=""/>

<b>Entry and Residence Permit</b>
For tourism, everything is simple - no visa for 60 days in a row, and in total no more than 90 out of 180. It is interesting that for Russian citizens in Turkey there is a fairly small fine for exceeding the period of stay: you can overstay for a year and pay $ 100 or so. However, overstaying is a bit risky, since Turkey actively hunts for illegal immigrants, especially in large cities like Istanbul and Antalya - documents are checked in the metro, near shopping centers and on crowded streets. Documents are also very often checked when you travel by bus between cities. If you are caught without documents, then most likely they will take you to prison, where they will hold you until you buy a ticket and fly away, so it is better not to get caught.
Until 2022, Turkey was one of the very few countries where you could settle for a long time just like that. If you didn't know, you can't just up and move to most countries. You need some reason, and there are essentially two real reasons - either find a local husband/wife, or find an employer who will issue you documents for a work visa. In Turkey, there is such a thing as a "residence permit for the purpose of tourism". Until 2022, to get it, you only had to rent an apartment for a year, have the contract certified by a notary, buy the cheapest medical insurance for a year (costs $60) and fill out a questionnaire. In the spring of 2022, they also began to ask for a statement from an account in a Turkish bank with an amount of about $2,500 (6 minimum wages). Having received the initial residence permit (called "ikamet" in Turkish) for six months or a year, you could then renew it, which is even easier - you don't even need to sign a contract, just bring a document on registration (which we'll talk about below). You can renew it for two years at once, which I did successfully in September 2022. And at the end of December 2022, everything changed in one day. They simply stopped giving ikamet for rent. The instruction was unspoken, the rules did not change, they just started telling everyone that "your documents are not in order." Somehow they continued to give them only in Istanbul, however, with a much larger number of documents (such as a certificate of remote work, certified by an apostille). Renewal also became problematic. In some provinces (Izmir, Mugla), everyone was simply refused without any options. In some (Mersin), you could renew if you provided some certificates from the bank with different amounts (the requirements also change all the time). In Antalya, some people were just randomly extended, others were not. In 2024, the situation improved somewhat, most of those who arrived in 2022 left for Serbia, and those who stayed were extended more often. Also in 2024, a visa program for digital nomads (Digital nomad) appeared in Turkey. The program was kind of announced, but there is still no legislative basis for it, and they just give a tourist ikamet for six months. But you need to show an income of about $3,000 per month, and for some reason you must have a university degree.

In addition to the tourist ikamet, there is another relatively affordable type of residence permit - for real estate, or as they say more often "by tapu". Tapu is a certificate of ownership. Initially, the purchase of any apartment made it possible to obtain a residence permit. In April 2022, a requirement was introduced that the cost of an apartment should be at least $ 70 thousand, which is more or less adequate (the average apartment in popular cities will still cost this). And in 2023, they raised it to $ 200 thousand, which already corresponds to the price of elite real estate. True, these limits are not spelled out anywhere in the law, a purely internal order of the migration service. Therefore, some people began to file lawsuits against the migration service and win cases, this has even become commonplace. But it takes some time, money and perseverance to achieve success. Unlike the tourist ikamet, the tapu ikamet makes it possible to obtain Turkish citizenship after five years of residence. You don't even need to know the language for this, there is no exam. You can also get Turkish citizenship right away (within six months) if you buy real estate for $400k. This is more expensive than the Caribbean countries, but it is one of two citizenships for investment that are still available to Russian citizens. And unlike the Caribbean islands, you can sell the property after a few years, and there is a very real chance of doing so, since Turkey is a large country, and there is demand for expensive real estate here, among other things.
Having received a residence permit, you need to register at the address (Russian speakers habitually call it propiska). I was lucky - before me, my apartment was rented out for a short period, and no one was registered in it, so I was registered automatically when I received a residence permit. If someone is registered in the apartment, then you need to go to the migration service separately and bring a utility bill in your name. But many utility services require registration in order to re-register the bills in your name, it turns out to be a catch 22. But somehow people get out of it. After receiving a residence permit, you can register on the e-devlet website (you can get a temporary password at the post office). This website is like the Russian "Gosuslugi", only a million times more convenient and functional. In particular, you can print out your registration and get a certificate of no criminal record from there. 

<b>Money</b>
The Turkish lira often falls, which is why prices in lira are constantly out of date. In 2013, when I was in Istanbul for the <a href="http://goo.gl/puJCBZ">first time</a>, they gave less than 2 lira for 1 dollar, and Turkey was at the level of Western Europe and then Russia in terms of prices with a dollar at 30. Since then, the lira has depreciated 16 times! There were two big rapid drops: from 8 to 14 per dollar at the end of 2021, and then from 18 to 28 in the summer of 2023 after the presidential elections. Because of this, in 2022-2023, Turkey was a very cheap country at certain times, even cheaper than Russia at times. But since the rate settled around 30, prices have risen, and Turkey has become a mid-price country again.
There are certain problems with receiving lira. The thing is that it is very difficult to find an ATM in Turkey that does not charge a huge commission. And at the airport or in the center of Istanbul, it seems almost impossible to do so. The standard commission at ATMs is either 5% or 200 lira (which is not much less with a limit of 5,000 lira). All large banks, which are everywhere throughout the country, charge a huge commission. Commission-free rates are available at the rarer banks ING, Seker and PTT.
It is also not easy to exchange cash; exchange offices almost always have either a bad rate or a commission. Bank branches also do not always agree to exchange. A good rate can often be found in a jewelry store (if you do not know, you will not guess that jewelers exchange currency).
Among Turkish banks, there are four that open accounts for foreigners (the rest can only be opened if you have a work visa and your employer is serviced by this bank). These are Ziraat, Deniz, Vakif and İş banks. The requirements for opening an account are constantly changing, in fact, each specific branch employee can come up with their own requirements and haggle. Basically, you need a tax number, which can be obtained on the tax website. 
Deniz bank is the most popular bank among Russians (was). It was easy to open, provided that you put $ 2,500 into the account (in the spring of 2022). Then the amount rose to 5,000, then to 10,000, a mandatory purchase of unnecessary insurance was added, also for a considerable amount, etc. 
Ziraat bank - there are no clear conditions, it's different everywhere. In 2022, they asked for $ 5,000 for a deposit, in 2023 they offered me to open a deposit in lira for a similar amount (ha-ha, just before the fall of the lira). 
Vakif bank - usually they just ask for a fee for opening an account, about $ 150-300 depending on the city. I opened it in a small non-tourist town for free.
İş bank - opens only with a residence permit and registration, but nothing else is needed.

There are also Islamic banks. From the user's point of view, there is no particular difference, the only thing is that their cards cannot be used to pay in liquor stores.
Ziraat Katilim, Vakif Katilim - Islamic divisions of the banks of the same name. The conditions are usually the same as in the parent bank
Kuveyt Turk - opens accounts only in lira
Turkiye Finans - someone seemed to be able to open in this bank, but I did not.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53076556791_b60c914269_o.jpg" title=""/>
In terms of functionality, all banks are more or less the same. The main difference is in sending transfers abroad. In Deniz and Ziraat, transfers are actually prohibited, you can only send if you come to the branch and ask, but most likely they will refuse (especially if you do not have a residence permit). Vakif seems to be more loyal, and you can send to your own account abroad. İş allows you to send freely, so this bank wins.
Within Turkey, transfers in lira up to 100,000 lira are instant (like in the "fast payment system" in Russia). There is a small commission for transfers, on the other hand, the cards and accounts in Turkish banks are free, the service does not cost anything. Transfers are made not by phone number, but by IBAN (account number). Payment by transfer (instead of acquiring) is used quite often if the amount is relatively large, for example, for a doctor's appointment.
When opening an account, all banks immediately give an unnamed debit card (in Deniz, sometimes the name is printed right away, without embossing). In Ziraat, you need to order a personalized card and wait two weeks. I don't know exactly how in İş and Vakif, I did not order, since an unnamed card is quite enough (in Ziraat, an unnamed card without a chip, that is, you can only pay with it by swiping the magnetic strip, cards of other banks have both a chip and Paypass). Turkish debit cards may not work well on non-Turkish websites, such as booking.com and airbnb.com. You also can't rent a car with them. Some people get credit cards, which work more reliably. Usually you need to put a certain amount on a frozen deposit, and there will be a credit limit for this or a smaller amount. It makes sense to make a minimum amount, like 1000 lira, since you can always put your own money on top, and the frozen deposit depreciates over time. I think İş Bank can even open a credit card without a deposit if you use a debit card for some time. I myself have not opened credit cards, since I have cards from other countries with credit card functionality. 

In addition to banks, there are many neobanks in Turkey - payment services. As a rule, they work on the infrastructure of some bank, that is, to top up your account, you need to make a transfer to a real bank X to the neobank account with your account number in the system in the comments. Some actually have full-fledged personal IBAN for everyone, this is somewhere in the middle between a bank and a payment service. They do not have international transfers, but the cards can be used in everyday life. Neobank cards are sometimes better than debit cards (for example, they work on airbnb). Cards can be bought in some supermarkets or ordered for delivery. You can buy such a card (for 5-10 lira) and use it right away, however, without document verification there will be a very small limit of about $ 100 per month. Verification usually occurs automatically by the ikamet number, but some for the highest level of verification also require signing an agreement, with which the courier will arrive personally. 
Main neobanks: 
Papara - the most popular and advanced neobank. It has personal IBAN, all sorts of cashbacks, you can get insurance (I used it). 
Ininal - allows verification using a Russian passport (without a residence permit)
Ozan - used to accept passports too, but now it seems to have stopped
Uption - the only neobank that has accounts in dollars and euros, and you can transfer to some countries using IBAN.
Fups, Pokus, OlduBil, Hadi - nothing special
Unlike Europe, no one will ask you about the "source of origin" of funds in Turkish banks. You can bring $100,000 in cash to the bank and deposit it into an account, or buy an apartment for that amount. Withdrawing cash may be more difficult, managers may ask for a commission for this, especially in Deniz Bank.
Cryptocurrencies are regulated in Turkey. A new law was recently adopted that requires exchanges to obtain licenses. This is done in order to promote Turkish crypto exchanges: BtcTurk and Paribu. There is also TrBinance - a branch of Binance, which has its own domain and separate verification for Turkish documents. Banks do not like crypto, and if you are not a citizen, they can close your account instantly for transfers to the exchange or p2p. You can exchange cash at exchangers, I found exchangers with a low commission (0-0.5%).

There is an interesting situation with taxes - the law states that those who are in Turkey for tourism purposes are not tax residents. Thus, it turns out that you do not have to pay taxes. And even if you want to, you will not be able to pay, unlike Georgia, where it is easy to open an individual entrepreneur, this cannot be done in Turkey. If you receive payments to your account in a Turkish bank, then up to a certain point they do not ask anything (they named different limits, 4 or 10 thousand dollars per month). Anyway, just in case, I did not receive payments from legal entities directly, instead I used the Wise service for transit. 
The downside of this situation is that if you then go to some complicated country, you will not receive documents on the "legality" of the origin of money from Turkey (unlike, say, the UAE, where the tax is officially 0%). 
If you do become a tax resident of Turkey, then the taxes will be at the European level, from 20% progressive scale. 

<b>Language</b>
In general, knowledge of foreign languages ​​is not very good in Turkey. Outside of Istanbul and the resort area, people do not know a single word in English, not even the word "name", which is covered in the first lesson in the first grade. The only exception is hotels. In tourist areas, on the contrary, it is easy to find speakers not only of English, but also of German or Russian.
The Turkish language is not at all similar to the European languages ​​of the Indo-European family, although there are many borrowed words, and thanks to the Latin-based writing system, they can be recognized. I learned Turkish to a certain level that I can communicate when necessary and read, but I cannot speak freely, and it is difficult to understand complex phrases by ear. The fact is that in Turkish, the structure of sentences is the opposite of English, Russian and other Indo-European languages. More like Japanese, with which I had exactly the same problems when studying.

<b>Accommodation</b>
Hotel prices in tourist cities are usually tied to the euro, so they did not change much during the collapse of the exchange rate. But in more remote cities in 2022 there was plenty of freedom - you could rent a room for 10 euros, now this is not possible, and it will cost at least 20 for a bad old room or 30 for a good one. In Istanbul, in principle, you can also find a room for 30 euros in the center, but the room will most likely not be very good. 
Like in Brazil, in Turkey, hotels almost always have a free breakfast. Even more than in Brazil - in Turkey, breakfast was generally everywhere, except Istanbul. For breakfast here they eat: cheese, sausage, olives, French fries, boiled eggs, tomatoes, cucumbers, bread and tea. 
It's funny that booking.com is limited in Turkey. For some time it was completely blocked by the decision of the local Turkomnadzor, and now it opens, but does not show hotels in Turkey. That is, you need to turn on VPN, and then you can book without any problems. I didn't use Airbnb because the hotels were cheap.

For searching for long-term rentals, they usually use the site sahibinden.com, it works well in Istanbul and big cities. In small and resort towns like Kemer, they usually search through local realtors or through connections. In Turkey, the rental laws are as crazy as in Europe, that is, if a tenant stops paying, you can evict him only through the court with great difficulty. Because of this, people are reluctant to rent. Back in 2022-2023, there was a law that allowed the rental price to be raised by a maximum of 25% per year. Those who rented at the end of 2021 were lucky, because after two lira collapses, they could pay some absurdly low amount in 2023, like $100-200 per month. Because of this, especially in 2022, they were even less willing to rent out, and many owners wanted an advance payment for six months to a year (especially from foreigners). Utilities are called aydat in Turkish. In my apartment, the owner paid aydat, so I don’t know how much it was. But with this money, the gardener took care of our entire large yard and garden, and also cleaned the pool. Our complex also had a shared Internet, which I actively used, since I couldn’t get a separate line for myself. I paid for electricity and water myself from the utilities. These amenities are very cheap, 1 kilowatt/hour still costs something around 1.50 lira. I have never spent more than 1000 lira per month on electricity. Most of it was in winter with heaters, a little less in summer with air conditioners. In the off-season, when the air conditioner was not used, it was about 300 lira. Water costs next to nothing, 50-100 lira per month.

<b>Transport</b>
Domestic flights are relatively inexpensive: you can fly from Istanbul to any city for ~$50 even on Turkish Airlines. There are two low-cost airlines - Anadolu Jet and Pegasus, but they cost about the same. Of course, there are most flights from Istanbul, but there are also flights from Ankara every day to any city, and quite a few flights from other cities: Antalya, Izmir. At Van airport, I saw about 7 different cities on the board, but to Kayseri (Cappadocia) there are flights only from Istanbul (Ankara is too close to fly). 
There are trains in Turkey. At the moment, three large cities are connected by high-speed rail: Istanbul, Ankara and Konya. You can get from Istanbul to Ankara in 4 hours, and it costs 540 lira (less than $20). Trains are noticeably cheaper than buses, it's a pity that there are so few of them. There are quite a few regular trains (not even all large cities have a railway), and they are slow, so they often run at night. I have not traveled in sleeping cars, but I have been on a regular train on the Denizli - Izmir route, it looks about the same as a high-speed train (there are even sockets). 
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946417495_2fb59032f7_o.jpg" title=""/>
Buses are the standard way of getting around. You can look up the schedule online, for example, at <a>obilet.com</a>. The system is centralized, I once saw a program used by a cashier - all the companies are in a single table. They usually ask for a phone number, and the ticket is sent to it via SMS, sometimes they print it out or write it out by hand on a form. Buses are quite comfortable, most often the seats in a row are 2+1, if you are alone, you will be seated on the left. Both trains and buses indicate the gender of the passenger, and when buying a ticket you can see the gender of the passengers in the occupied seats, apparently this is done so that it is impossible to sit next to a lonely woman.
In Turkey, bus stations are often located at a completely absurd distance from the city. For example, in Erzurum you need to go almost 10 kilometers through the fields, that is, it is not even the outskirts of the city, but for some reason they built a bus station in an open field far from the city limits. As I understand it, this is done because most buses in Turkey do not travel between neighboring cities, but all sorts of long and complicated routes across the country. And due to the fact that the bus stations are on the highway, they can strictly adhere to the schedule, avoiding traffic jams when entering / leaving the city, well, and reducing the overall travel time. On the other hand, it is inconvenient, of course, that you often have to take a taxi to the city.

<b>City transport</b>
It is quite inconvenient in Turkey that in all more or less large cities you can pay for travel using transport cards, you can't pay in cash. At the same time, the cards themselves are not always available for purchase at a machine, you'll have to run around. Recently, the situation has improved, and in some cities you can pay with a regular bank card with a contactless payment function (the price will be slightly higher). In particular, in Antalya this works on both trams and buses.
The most problematic city is, of course, Istanbul, because it is there that public transport is most needed, and it is difficult to avoid using it (at least there is no alternative to ferries). I did not find a cash desk with a live operator anywhere, even in the metro. Theoretically, you can buy an Istanbulkart card in a machine, but in fact, there are often no machines at the airport, train station, or in general in the city center. But the most sophisticated perversion is how to put money on the card. There are two types of machines - with buttons and with a touch screen. The latter simply never work, so if you are at the Marmaray train station, just look for another place to top up, or watch the locals walk in circles from one broken machine to another. Once out of ten times, someone suddenly manages to top up the card, after which the machine goes into outage and reboots for about 15 minutes. Machines with buttons are better, but whether it takes money from you or not is a matter of luck. Usually takes 20 lira notes, but most likely not 5, 10, 50 lira. There is even a coin acceptor, but not a single machine I examined accepted coins.
Previously, when using IstanbulKart, there was a big discount when transferring from the metro to the bus, but since 2023 this only works if your card is linked to a residence permit (and for citizens). So it is probably easier for tourists now to buy tickets for 1 trip, they are not much more expensive.
The Istanbul metro is a special kind of perversion, since it has an extremely inconvenient layout - there are almost no transfers, the lines hang one above the other. On the new line from the airport, you need to travel with two or three transfers, and almost all transfers from line to line also require a new payment, and the transfers are very long.
Ankara has a fairly functional metro, where it is convenient to buy tickets for one trip. In other cities there are 1-2 metro lines (Izmir, Adana, Bursa) or modern trams (Antalya, Konya, Samsun, Kayseri, etc.)
In small towns, as a rule, payment for travel is only in cash. In particular, in Kemer and on buses between Kemer and Antalya.
The fare is about 20 lira, stably staying around $0.50-0.60.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53075981867_eba7269305_o.jpg" title=""/>
Taxis in Turkey use a meter, almost always honestly, which is nice. The price is not very good though - at least 20 lira per kilometer, and sometimes 25 ($0.60-0.80). It is easy to catch a taxi on the street, and there are also often taxi booths where drivers hang out waiting for passengers. In some cities, for example in Antalya, there are still special buttons that you can press to call a taxi.
In general, by the standards of the pre-Internet era, taxis in Turkey would be fine, but modern taxi apps have not yet been brought in. Theoretically, there is Uber and the local analogue BiTaksi, but in fact they only work in Istanbul and Ankara. Even in Izmir (the third largest city) there were only a couple of cars. In theory, these apps are just for calling, and the price is still determined by the meter. In fact, no matter how many times I tried to use apps, a taxi never came, drivers constantly cancel orders, demand more money, in general, it is unclear what they want at all.

<b>Food</b>
Turkish food is pleasant and tasty, although not very varied - all establishments have more or less the same menu. The collapse of the exchange rate affected food the most, its price does not grow so quickly, so the prices in supermarkets were very low in certain periods: for example, a large bottle of cola cost 60 cents. By 2024, prices stabilized, and it was no longer so cheap (the same 2.5 liter cola costs 50 lira = $ 1.5). 
The cheapest option to eat is canteens (Lokantasi) and fast food with shawarma. Approximate prices in 2024 are as follows. This is a restaurant near my house, I think in Kemer, but far from the sea, so the prices are not inflated. 
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945984191_6cc9c30a8c_o.jpg" title=""/> 
I always try on the price of Adana kebab. 250 ($8) is a common thing now, if you go somewhere far from the sea, you can find it for 200, but hardly less. In the summer of 2022 it cost 55 ($3), in the summer of 2023 - 150 ($5).
There are different types of kebab - Urfa, Iskender, Jag, Adana. My personal favorite is Adana kebab, I even tried to cook it myself at home - you need to season the meat with cumin and sumac (Turkish spice). At the same time, restaurants give out free snacks - eggplant salad, yogurt, vegetable salad, and of course bread, which is always available everywhere, and very tasty.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946417545_94a9c35e78_o.jpg" title=""/>
Jag kebab is made from some offal, like the dish "kokorech".
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946220488_6710988659_o.jpg" title=""/>
The shashlik that we are more familiar with is "shish kebab", the main thing is not to miss and not take from the liver (ciger) instead of meat.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946220518_d3330291e4_o.jpg" title=""/>
There is also such a thing as pide - it is like pizza on a very thin crust.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946417350_d658103966_o.jpg" title=""/>
Excellent sweets, in addition to the Turkish delight sold in the store, you can get a pie "kunefe" ​​in the cafe.

Turkish ice cream is known for its viscous texture.

Turks always drink tea after a meal from classic glasses that look like flasks. When you finish eating, you are always asked if you want tea. Tea is sometimes free, and sometimes it costs 5-10 lira. Also in Turkey they drink strong coffee from a Turk, but my personal favorite is a drink called "salep" - a drink made from "orchid root", which I have not encountered in other countries. In the store, bags of salep cost 5-6 lira per serving.

I have already <a href="https://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/766813.html">done a review of products in the supermarket</a>. In short, meat is relatively expensive in Turkey - there is no pork, and beef is really expensive (>$25/kilo). Vegetables and fruits are very cheap, and it is better to buy them at the market, which is held in each district at least once a week. It is also better to buy fish and seafood at the market.

<b>Internet</b>
Turkey is one of the problematic countries in terms of mobile Internet. Firstly, there is an incredibly absurd law that you can't use a foreign phone for more than 4 months. That is, as soon as you insert a Turkish SIM card into your phone, you receive an SMS that you have 4 months to register. Registration used to be very expensive, $200-300, and in 2023 it was raised to ~$1,000. If some people paid $200 (especially iPhone owners), then I doubt $1,000, that's absurd. It's easier to buy a new phone in Turkey, although they are twice as expensive there as in most countries.
Theoretically, after 4 months, the phone is blocked by IMEI. In fact, it turned out not to be so bad. I came to Turkey with my phone back in December 2021, and somewhere around the end of August (when I was in Iran), my phone was blocked. After that, I moved the Turkish SIM card to the second slot, which worked fine. SMS messages were also received on it, but an "amnesty" usually occurs around January 1. As a result, my first slot was unblocked in January 2023, but the second one has not been blocked to this day, 2.5 years later. Perhaps this is because I often travel abroad, and if you sit in Turkey all the time, the likelihood of blocking is higher.
The second problem is that the connection is very expensive - about $ 25-30 for a new SIM card. If you have a residence permit, it will be a little cheaper (in 2022, I remember it was ~300 lira for tourists, and I bought it for ~200). The cheapest card is from the virtual operator BimCell, which can be bought in the BIM grocery chain. I bought it for 150 lira / $ 10, and now it costs about $ 15. It can be issued without a residence permit, although not all stores can do this, and it was even more of an adventure to link it to a residence permit (without a residence permit, the SIM card is disconnected after 3 months). An Internet package (and calls with SMS) for 20 GB now costs 270 lira, before it was closer to $ 6. If the traffic runs out, you can buy additional packages cheaper.
I did not use home Internet - they refused to install it for me, because "my complex has reached its connection limit". I used the public Wi-Fi of our complex, which worked fine, except in the summer, when there were a lot of people. Well, and mobile Internet. If you connect home Internet, then it is not easy to break the contract later, you will have to pay as for a couple of years of tariff. 

<b>Mail</b> 
There are quite a lot of delivery services in Turkey, and within the country they are inexpensive - from various online stores, delivery is free or costs 20 lira, and they can be delivered from somewhere in the east of the country. The largest online store is trendyol.com, I ordered mainly from it, since I am used to it. I have not seen post offices in Turkey, like in Moscow, but it is possible to pick up from pick-up points, which are organized in some regular store (for example, in my village it is a curtain store). True, pickup is not available for all products, it depends on the company selling the specific product, and not on the marketplace.
So I received delivery directly from the courier many times (in Russia, I think I ordered only once during the quarantine in 2020, but otherwise I always used pickup or post offices). Fortunately, since I lived in a cit (residential complex), it was easy for couriers to find it, in extreme cases they could leave the order in the guard's house, but usually I was at home, since I knew from the tracking that the courier would be there. Those who live in apartment buildings in Istanbul and other cities, I heard, sometimes have problems with deliveries because the addresses are not always obvious.
Few people order from abroad, since the customs tax starts at $ 30 or something like that.

<b>Medicine</b>
In Turkey, there is public and private medicine. The state one is quite technological - there is an electronic appointment with doctors and many other electronic services (electronic prescriptions, for example). An appointment at a state hospital is relatively inexpensive - $15-30. In private ones it is much more expensive, closer to $100 on average. I treated my teeth for about $50 per tooth. But in a private one there is a higher probability of finding a doctor who speaks English if you do not know Turkish.
Pharmacies are suddenly designated with the letter E (from the word Eczane), which was unusual at first. In pharmacies, prices for medicines are fixed, which is nice. On Sundays, one pharmacy is open per district.
Requirements for prescriptions in Turkey are quite low, in particular, here you can buy many powerful antibiotics and antidepressants without a prescription.

<b>What to see</b>
Turkey is very actively being built and rebuilt. In this way, it strongly resembles China - here the same attitude to historical buildings, they have torn them down almost everywhere, and now in some places they are building from scratch in the "old" style. When you travel around provincial cities in Turkey, it seems that almost everything was built in the last 10 years - even in some small towns in the middle of nowhere there are huge blocks of multi-story new buildings. In some large cities there are still old areas similar to Brazilian favelas, but they are quickly disappearing.

In Turkey, in every city there will be many monuments to Ataturk, like in Russia - monuments to Lenin. Or even more, because in Turkey you can even see two monuments to Ataturk in one square. Also, a portrait of Ataturk hangs in every office, store, institution, or simply on the wall. Sometimes they also hang a portrait of the current president Erdogan, and gradually monuments and objects renamed in honor of July 15 (15 Temmuz) - the new national holiday "Democracy Day" (the anniversary of the failed coup of 2016) - are appearing in different cities.

There are quite a lot of historical cities (although their buildings have not been preserved for the most part), and Turkey also has a huge number of forts and fortresses, probably more than anywhere else: almost every city has preserved a massive fortress, while in Europe they were demolished in most cities back in the 19th century. Also in Turkey you can see traces of ancient civilizations: Byzantium, the Roman Empire, Ancient Greece, the Hittite Empire and ancient Armenia.

Entrance to attractions has recently become quite expensive - the price is tied to the euro, and the most popular places like Ephesus or Topkapi Palace can cost 20-30-40 euros. Ephesus is okay, but some places have become insanely expensive, for example, the Galata Tower, in my opinion, is not worth 30 euros, it is essentially just an observation tower. I visited most of the museums conditionally free of charge, since I used a museum card - for 60 liras per year you can visit the vast majority of museums throughout the country. But this is only for citizens and holders of a residence permit. In the spring of 2024, the museum card became unavailable to those with a residence permit. And in August it became available again, but for 500 liras (which, however, is also inexpensive if you plan to visit more than two museums).

Turkey has a fairly small administrative division, more than 80 provinces (il in Turkish). Therefore, it is better to describe the statistical macroregions.

<b>Marmara Region</b>. Istanbul is located here - the largest city and former capital, where there are many attractions.

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946220328_5a54689e9e_o.jpg" title=""/>
Edirne - the former capital (before Istanbul), there is a mosque from the World Heritage List.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945957936_42f01b727f_o.jpg" title=""/>
Canakkale is a city on the Dardanelles Strait. The site of Turkey's military glory in World War I, and the excavations of the ancient city of Troy are also nearby.

Bursa is the third largest city in Turkey, also the capital before Istanbul.

<b>Aegean region.</b> The largest city is Izmir. Quite colorful, although it burned down almost entirely at the beginning of the 20th century.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945070187_17c8c6e16d_o.jpg" title=""/>
There are some very significant archaeological sites in this region: Ephesus, Pamukkale, Bergama.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945070172_a4df002595_o.jpg" title=""/>
Also here are the resorts of the Aegean coast, generally much more expensive than in the Antalya region, more popular with tourists from Europe.

<b>Mediterranean region.</b> Historical regions of Lycia, Pamphylia and Cilicia. Lycia is from Antalya to Fethiye, the most beautiful part with mountains right by the sea. Kemer, Demre, Kas are wonderful places.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946443645_2a701eac75_o.jpg" title=""/>
And Antalya itself is a city where I have probably seen everything.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946295569_7f7cd9b7e2_o.jpg" title=""/>
Pamphylia is from Antalya to the east. Here is Alanya - the most "Russian" city in Turkey, and more expensive resorts in the Serik and Manavgat area.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52687993812_390dc34219_o.jpg" title=""/>
Cilicia is even further, fewer people get here. Here is Adana - the birthplace of the kebab of the same name, Mersin - a developing resort, the historical cities of Tarsus and Anamur.

<b>Black Sea region.</b> A rarely visited part of Turkey. The main cities are Trabzon and Samsun, both quite interesting.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946232153_0e5be186c0_o.jpg" title=""/>
There are well-preserved cities of Safranbolu and Amasya. Safranbolu is the only city in Turkey listed by UNESCO for its architecture.

<b>Central Anatolia.</b> This is where Ankara is located - the capital of Turkey, which is relatively rarely visited, but I really like this city. Here you can see the remains of the old city, the new city, and the pseudo-historical reconstruction of the old city at the same time.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945058532_c617de7f97_o.jpg" title=""/>
The most popular attraction in central Turkey is, of course, Cappadocia.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945957921_460273f598_o.jpg" title=""/>
Of the historical cities, the most interesting here are Konya and Afyonkarahisar.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946232188_881db2158f_o.jpg" title=""/>
Also in central Anatolia you can find the remains of various ancient and very ancient civilizations: Hattusa, Catalhoyuk, Arslantepe, etc.

<b>Southeastern Anatolia.</b>
A small but very colorful region, here is the real East, unlike the Europeanized large cities and resorts.
The most interesting cities are Sanliurfa and Diyarbakir (as well as Mardin, where I have not been).
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946486720_68570d28b2_o.jpg" title=""/>
Also here is Mount Nemrut and Gobekli Tepe.

<b>Eastern Anatolia.</b>
The easternmost part of Turkey, the territory where mainly Armenians used to live. The most interesting city in this region is Kars - for some time it was part of the Russian Empire.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946443650_3e2a2a95e4_o.jpg" title=""/>
Near Kars are the ruins of the ancient Armenian city of Ani.

In other cities, such as Erzurum or Van, little remains.
