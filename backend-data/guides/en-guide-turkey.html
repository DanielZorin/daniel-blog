Turkey or Türkiye is the country visited by the largest number of Russian tourists. I was there a couple of times as a child at the resorts, then in 2013 I went to Istanbul, and somehow I kept putting off a detailed exploration of this country - well, it’s close, visa-free, it’s cheap to fly, I’ll always have time. So for quite a long time this very culturally significant country remained almost a blank spot on my world map. But I planned to go there in December 2021, and then the local currency fell in half, and I thought now was a good chance to see everything as cheaply as possible. I expanded the route, planned a second trip immediately for January 2022.
Türkiye turned out to be an interesting and unusual country. Although millions of tourists come there, most of the country lives completely separate from this. I was struck by the almost complete absence of tourists in many even very famous attractions. The atmosphere reminded me most of all of China - no one speaks a word of English either, many things are not designed for foreigners, architecture, urban planning, attitude towards historical heritage, economic policy, censorship and political opression - parallels can be drawn everywhere.

<b>Entry</b>
Türkiye has been visa-free for a long time. Now, to enter, you need either a PCR test or a vaccination certificate, that is, by today’s standards,  it is easy.
When traveling you will need a HES code - this is the local QR code system. While in Russia QR codes are designed, theoretically, to prevent the unvaccinated from entering certain places, the Turkish system unsuccessfully tries to copy the structure of the Chinese gulag, where everyone is monitored through the phone, and the QR code is painted red if it was in the wrong place. Only the Turkish system does not work, because codes are hardly scanned anywhere; in reality, they are only needed for traveling by public transport, where the code is entered when selling a ticket. You can get a HES code in several ways:
- Before entering, you need to fill out a form on the website, after which a HES code is generated, which in theory should be sufficient for a foreigner.
- You can send an SMS with your name, date of birth and passport number, and you will receive a code in response.
- You can download the “Life fits into home” application and generate as many codes as you like.
If you scan the code with the app, it can show whether the owner is vaccinated, but not for foreigners. The validity period of the codes from the entry form is six months, from SMS - a year, in the application - you can set any deadline, including unlimited. A couple of times when buying bus tickets I was told that my HES code was invalid and they gave me a new one via SMS, I don’t know why. They were all displayed in the application (the link is based on the passport number).
There are no restrictions for unvaccinated people in Turkey, with the exception of domestic flights - you need either a certificate or a PCR test. Therefore, for domestic flights, foreigners cannot check in online, but must show a document at the counter.
The most crazy thing is linking the HES code to the travel card, but more on that later.



<b>Language</b>
In Turkey, knowledge of foreign languages ​​is very poor, approximately at the level of China or Russia. Outside of Istanbul and the resort area, people do not know a single word in English, not even the word “name”, which is taught in the first lesson in first grade. The only exception is hotels.
The Turkish language is not at all similar to the European languages ​​of the Indo-European family, although there are many borrowed words, and thanks to the Latin-based writing they can be recognized. Of the interesting facts, in the Turkish language in ordinary words the stress falls on the last syllable, but in geographical names it does not, and many cities in Turkish are pronounced with unexpected stress, for example: istAnbul, Izmir (not izmIr), KAyseri, Ankara, KusadasI, GazIantep, DiyArbakir.

<b>Money</b>
The Turkish lira is constantly falling, making lira prices constantly outdated. In 2013, when I was in Istanbul for <a href="http://goo.gl/puJCBZ">the first time</a>, for 1 dollar they gave less than 2 liras, and Turkey’s prices were at the level of Western Europe and Russia. Since then, the ruble has depreciated by 2.5 times, and the lira by as much as 7 times! Moreover, the drop from 8 to 14 per dollar occurred in the second half of 2021. Nowadays in Turkey, it is a common occurrence to see price tags overlaid on restaurant menus or even on museum tickets.
There are certain problems with getting liras. In Turkey it is very difficult to find an ATM that does not have a fee. And it seems almost impossible to do this at the airport or the center of Istanbul. The standard commission at ATMs is either 5% or 200 liras (which is not much less with a limit of 5000 liras). I once had free time, and I went around a lot of ATMs: there were more than 10 of them at the Antalya bus station, and even more in the center of the non-tourist city of Denizli. As a result, in Denizli I came across an ATM that had no commission at all - it was an ATM of some small local bank. All the big banks, which are everywhere throughout the country, charge huge commissions. This same ATM, by the way, is the only one that did not offer fraudulent conversion into dollars at a fixed rate when withdrawing.
Exchanging cash is also not easy; exchange offices almost always offer either a bad exchange rate or a commission.

<b>Accomodation</b>
The price-quality ratio of hotels in Turkey is very good. It seems that the prices are tied to the euro (at least on booking.com, the price was almost always shown to me in euros, not in lira), so they are cheap regardless of the collapse in the exchange rate. In general, you can rent an excellent room everywhere for a maximum of 20 euros, except for Istanbul, where for this money you will get a very small room in the center. In non-tourist cities, there were huge comfortable rooms everywhere for ridiculous prices, as low as 10 euros per day.
Like in Brazil, in Turkey hotels almost always offer free breakfast. Even more than in Brazil - in Turkey, breakfast was available everywhere except Istanbul. For breakfast they eat: cheese, sausage, olives, French fries, boiled eggs, tomatoes, cucumbers, bread and tea.
It's funny that booking.com is limited in Turkey. For some time it was completely blocked by the decision of the local authorities, and now it is available, but does not show hotels in Turkey. That is, you need to turn on the VPN, and then you can book without any problems.
I didn’t use Airbnb because the hotels were cheap.

<b>Transport</b>
Domestic flights are very cheap: from Istanbul you can fly to any city for 20-30 dollars, even on Turkish Airlines. There are two low-cost airlines - Anadolu Jet and Pegasus, but they cost about the same. The most flights, of course, are from Istanbul, but there are also flights from Ankara every day to any city, and quite a few flights from other cities like Antalya and Izmir. At Van airport, I saw about 7 different cities on the board, but to Kayseri (Cappadocia) flights arrive only from Istanbul (too close to Ankara to fly).
There are trains in Turkey. Currently, three major cities are connected by high-speed rail: Istanbul, Ankara and Konya. You can get from Istanbul to Ankara in 4 hours, and it costs less than 100 liras, that is, incredibly cheap (for comparison, the Russian Sapsan for a slightly longer distance costs on average 10 times more). From Ankara to Konya, a ticket generally costs only 35 liras.
There are quite a few regular trains (not even all large cities have a railway), and they are slow, so they often run at night. I didn’t travel in sleeping cars, but I was on a regular train on the Denizli - Izmir route, it looks about the same as a high-speed train (it even has power outlets). Costs 2 times cheaper than a bus.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-turkey-790458_original.jpg" title=""/>
Buses are the standard method of transportation. The schedule can be viewed on the Internet, for example, at <a href="https://obilet.com/">obilet.com</a>. The system is centralized, I once saw a program that the cashier uses - all the companies are in a single table. As a standard, they ask for a phone number, and the ticket is sent to it via SMS; sometimes they print it out or write it out by hand. The buses are quite comfortable, most often the seats in a row are 2+1, if you are alone, you will be seated on the left. Both on trains and buses the gender of the passenger is marked, and when you buy a ticket you can see the gender of the passengers in the occupied seats, apparently this was done so that it would not be possible to sit next to a single woman.
In Turkey, bus stations are often located at a completely absurd distance from the city, inexplicable by anything. For example, in Erzurum you need to drive almost 10 kilometers through fields, that is, this is not even the outskirts of the city, but for some reason they simply built a bus station in an open field far from the city limits. Why this is necessary is unclear; apparently, they support the taxi industry so that they earn a little more by transporting passengers to the bus station.

<b>Urban transport</b>
Everything is very bad in this area. Transport is terribly inconvenient if you are not a city resident. The fact is that in bigger cities you can't pay for travel in cash (I don’t even mention bank cards). You need a local transport card, which is different for each city. However, where to buy it is not always clear. For example, in Izmir I was never able to travel by metro, although I visited three stations in the center - there were machines there only for top up, but not for sale. Cash desks with living people in Turkey are also often missing, which makes the situation hopeless.
The most problematic city, of course, is Istanbul, because it is there that public transport is most needed, and it is difficult to avoid using it (at least there is no alternative to ferries). I couldn’t find a ticket office with a live operator anywhere, even in the subway. Theoretically, you can buy an Istanbulkart card from a vending machine, but in fact, in 99% of cases there are no vending machines at the airport, train station or in the city center in general, although there may be a reseller in the area who will sell the card for double the price. Next, you need to link the card to the HES code. This is complete absurdity, because you only tap the card at the entrance, and it’s impossible to find out how many stops you rode. The system works rather poorly - out of two codes I received five minutes apart, one didn’t work for some reason, I linked two cards to one person, and resellers in general probably link them to themselves. But the most sophisticated perversion is how to put money on a card. There are two types of machines - with buttons and with a touch screen. The latter simply never work, so if you are at the Marmaray train station, just look for another place to top up, or watch how the locals walk in circles from one non-working machine to another. One time out of ten, someone suddenly manages to top up the card, after which the machine goes out of service and reboots for about 15 minutes. Machines with buttons are better, but whether it will take your money or not depends on your luck. It usually takes 20 lira bills, but probably not 5, 10, 50 lira bills. There is even a coin slot, but not a single machine I examined accepted coins.
In Ankara, I lived near the central metro station, where several lines intersected, and there was always at least one ticket office where tickets for one trip were sold for 4 liras. Other stations usually didn’t have this luxury, so I figured out how many tickets I needed and bought a pack at once.
In smaller cities, I usually didn’t try to use public transport, or there was no reason. I've taken a taxi quite a few times - it's cheap now, since prices are in liras, and one trip cost me a maximum of 50 liras (4 dollars). Taxis almost always drive honestly according to the meter, which is nice. It's easy to catch a taxi on the street, except in Trabzon, where for some reason there are very few of them. There are often taxi booths where drivers hang out, waiting for passengers.
There are essentially no taxi apps. Theoretically, there is Uber and the local equivalent BiTaksi, but in fact they only operate in Istanbul and Ankara. Even in Izmir (the third largest city) there were only a couple of cars. The prices in the apps are higher than on the meter, at least in Izmir it showed me 80 liras to the bus station, but on the meter it turned out to be 50.

<b>Food</b>
The food turned out to be quite interesting and varied, I brought myself several gifts and several recipes. Food was most affected by the collapse of the exchange rate, its price does not rise so quickly, so prices in supermarkets were very low: for example, a large bottle of cola actually cost 60 cents, cheaper than anywhere in the world. Local fruits such as tangerines and pomegranates cost mere pennies, like 30 cents per kilogram.
In restaurants, prices began to rise before my eyes; they changed the price tags, but it was still cheap. The cheapest option to eat is canteens (Lokantasi) and fast foods with shawarma. Approximate prices in non-tourist places are as follows:
<img alt="" src="images/guide-turkey-790778_original.jpg" title=""/>
In principle, such places can be found even in the center of Istanbul if you look for it. I preferred to go to slightly higher level establishments that serve meat dishes such as kebabs. There are different types of kebab - Urfa, Iskender, Cag, Adana. My personal favorite is the Adana kebab, I even tried making it myself at home - you need to season the meat with cumin and sumac (Turkish spice). This kebab cost somewhere around 40-50 liras (3-4 dollars). At the same time, restaurants provide free snacks - eggplant salad, yogurt, vegetable salad, and of course bread, which is always available everywhere and is very tasty.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-turkey-789690_original.jpg" title=""/>
Cag kebab is made from some offal, just like the Kokorec dish.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-turkey-791446_original.jpg" title=""/>
The shish kebab known in Russia as shashlyk, the main thing is not to miss and not to take liver instead of meat (use google translate on the menu!).
<img alt="" src="images/guide-turkey-791000_original.jpg" title=""/>
There is also such a thing as pide - this is a type of pizza with a very thin crust.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-turkey-792100_original.jpg" title=""/>
Excellent sweets, in addition to Turkish delight (lokum) sold in the store, you can also get kunefe pie in the cafe.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-turkey-792462_original.jpg" title=""/>
Turkish ice cream is known for its chewy texture.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-turkey-791568_original.jpg" title=""/>
After meals, Turks always drink tea from classic flask-like glasses. Always, when you finish, they ask you whether to bring tea. A glass of tea costs an average of 5 liras, which is very little. They also drink strong Turkish coffee in Turkey, but my personal favorite is a drink called “salep” - a drink made from “orchid root”, which I have not seen in other countries. I bought myself a bunch of packs for brewing salep; in the store they cost 2-3 liras per serving.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-turkey-792634_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Internet</b>
Türkiye is one of the problematic countries in terms of mobile Internet. The fact is that there is an incredibly absurd law here according to which you cannot use a foreign phone for more than 4 months. That is, as soon as you insert a Turkish SIM card into your phone, you receive an SMS that you have 4 months to register. Registration in this case costs some absurd money like 200 or 300 dollars, that is, it is cheaper to buy a new phone. After 4 months the phone is blocked by IMEI. Theoretically, the meaning of this law is to prevent Turkish residents from buying phones abroad, but why such protective requirements are completely unclear. This turns out to be very inconvenient for tourists, because if you want to go to Turkey a second time after some time, you will not be able to buy a new SIM card unless you change your phone.
The second problem is that connection is expensive - at least 180-200 liras, which is 15 dollars at the current exchange rate, and previously the price of a SIM card was one of the highest in the world. The Internet packs themselves are not particularly expensive - I bought them around $1 per gigabyte when the main pack ran out.

<b>What to see</b>

Türkiye is very actively building and rebuilding. In this way, it is very much reminiscent of China - here they have the same attitude towards historical buildings, they were demolished almost everywhere, and now in some places they are building from scratch in the “old” style. When you travel around provincial cities in Turkey, it seems that almost everything was built in the last 10 years - even in some small towns there are huge blocks of multi-storey new buildings in the middle of nowhere. Some large cities still have old neighborhoods similar to Brazilian favelas, but they are quickly disappearing.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-turkey-791252_original.jpg" title=""/>
In Turkey, in every city there will be many monuments to Ataturk, just as in Russia there will be monuments to Lenin. Or even more, because in Turkey you can even see two monuments to Ataturk in one square. Also, a portrait of Ataturk hangs in every office, store, institution, or just on the wall. Sometimes a portrait of the current President Erdogan is also hung, and gradually monuments and objects appear in different cities renamed in honor of July 15 (15 Temmuz) - the new national holiday “democracy day” (the anniversary of the failed coup of 2016).
<img alt="" src="images/guide-turkey-791987_original.jpg" title=""/>
There are quite a lot of historical cities (although most of their buildings have not been preserved), and in Turkey there is a huge number of forts and fortresses, probably more than anywhere else: in almost every city a massive fortress was preserved, when in Europe they were demolished in most cities back in the 19th century. Also in Turkey you can see traces of ancient civilizations: Byzantium, the Roman Empire, Ancient Greece, the Hittite Empire and ancient Armenia.

Istanbul is the largest city and former capital. There are many famous attractions here, but overall I rather dislike the city. Much of the architecture has not been preserved; the center consists of boxes with signs and markets. There are problems with food - you need to try to look for places where prices are not inflated; in other cities there is no such problem. Terrible transport system, as I wrote about above. In general, this is a rare case when, having returned to the country again, I would prefer to go not to the main city, but to any other.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-turkey-794667_original.jpg" title=""/>
Ankara is the capital. A very interesting place where you can simultaneously see the remains of the old city, the new city, and the pseudo-historical reconstruction of the old city.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-turkey-793261_original.jpg" title=""/>
Edirne is the former capital (before Istanbul), there is a mosque listed as a World Heritage Site.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-turkey-794026_original.jpg" title=""/>
Canakkale is a city on the Dardanelles Strait. The site of Turkey's military glory in the First World War, and nearby are the excavations of the ancient city of Troy.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-turkey-793617_original.jpg" title=""/>
Izmir is the third largest city. Quite colorful, although almost all of it burned down at the beginning of the 20th century.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-turkey-794897_original.jpg" title=""/>
Selcuk is a city near Izmir, you can visit the ruins of the ancient city of Ephesus, the castle and the excavations of the Temple of Artemis.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-turkey-795980_original.jpg" title=""/>
Pamukkale - famous rock pools, a unique place worth visiting. In winter, be prepared for the fact that it will be cold, especially when climbing barefoot.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-turkey-795480_original.jpg" title=""/>
Antalya - charters with tourists fly here, the coast around is very beautiful and rocky, the villages mainly consist of large All Inclusive hotels. The city itself is quite interesting, there is an old part and fortress walls, beautiful views.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-turkey-793419_original.jpg" title=""/>
Konya is a historical city in the interior of the mainland, the center of Sufism.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-turkey-795170_original.jpg" title=""/>
Safranbolu is the only city in Turkey included in the UNESCO list for its architecture. You can see what cities looked like in the Ottoman Empire.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-turkey-795732_original.jpg" title=""/>
Cappadocia is the most popular off-coast destination in Turkey, with many unusual rocks, cities and churches in the rocks and hot air balloons.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-turkey-794470_original.jpg" title=""/>
Trabzon is the largest city on the Black Sea coast.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-turkey-796313_original.jpg" title=""/>
Erzurum is a large city in the east.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-turkey-794139_original.jpg" title=""/>
Van is one of the most distant cities; there is a large lake of the same name.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-turkey-796647_original.jpg" title=""/>

I left the south-eastern part uncovered, there are also some interesting places there: Diyarbakir, Sanliurfa, Adana, Mount Nemrut.

<b>Total</b>
Expenses for solo travel:
<img alt="" src="images/guide-turkey-789425_original.png" title=""/>
It’s just incredibly cheap, less than $50 a day even with flights. It’s a great country, I recommend visiting it.
