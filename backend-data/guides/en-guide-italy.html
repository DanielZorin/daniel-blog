June 2023 - Bolzano, Trento, Bologna, Rimini, Ancona, Assisi, Perugia, Pisa, Florence, Venice

<b>Transport</b>
The main transport in Italy is trains. There are, as usual, standard trains and high-speed ones (Frecce - “arrows”).
For regular trains the price is not high by European standards - about 7 euros per hour of travel. It does not depend on the time of purchase; you can buy a ticket from the machine before departure. For example, Verona - Venice, an hour and a half, a ticket costs 10 euros exactly. For the same route, a high-speed train ticket (which takes 1 hour) costs 28 euros. A few days in advance you can buy it for 20, and if way in advance, then even for 10.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-italy-842989_original.jpg" title=""/>
Let's take a longer route: Florence - Rome. The slow train ride takes 3.5 hours, the ticket costs 23.50 euros. Slow trains are not frequent on this route as it is long (to neighboring cities usually there are trains every hour). The Frecciarossa (Red Arrow) train costs 50 euros exactly, a little in advance - 39, even more in advance (Super Economy) - 30 euros, and the lowest price (Speciale Frecce) - 15 euros.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-italy-842151_original.jpg" title=""/>
Away from the main routes, there are small companies operating small lines/networks. In 2017, I had an extremely negative experience with such companies in the south - I didn’t get neither to Alberobello nor to Matera. And there was no one to even complain to, since their ticket offices/offices are open for a very limited time, unlike the offices of the main Trenitalia company.

An important feature of Italian railways is that tickets must be validated before travelling. In Spain and France this practice has almost disappeared, but in Italy it is still required. I always bought tickets through machines, and some tickets were for a specific time (and in theory did not need to be stamped), while others were without a time/train indication (and they need to be stamped). But I always stamped it just in case, since I was fined once a few years ago. In fact, conductors now check tickets mainly using the QR code.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-italy-841864_original.jpg" title=""/>

In addition to trains, there are buses of the well-known Flixbus company. For comparison, a FlixBus ticket from Florence to Rome for tomorrow costs 12-25 euros (depending on the time), and in advance - from 5 euros. But buses often run only between the largest cities, so you will still need trains to visit the cute little towns that Italy is so famous for.

For long distances, it makes sense to fly by plane; low-cost airlines like Ryanair fly from the north to the south of the country and to the islands.

You can get around the city by buses, and where available - by trolleybuses, trams or metro. As a rule, tickets last 60-90 minutes and allow transfers. A ticket for a single trip usually costs 1.50 euros (for example, in Rome, Florence), although in Milan it is 2.20 (the most expensive city).
There are metro in the cities: Rome, Milan, Turin, Naples, Genoa, Brescia, Catania. The last two are surprising given that these are fairly small cities. There is also a minimetro in Perugia - a unique form of transport.
<i>The Roman metro is one of the dirtiest in the world</i>

<b>Food</b>
Italian cuisine is so famous that it has essentially become the “default” cuisine for all European countries. Wherever you are from Lisbon to Helsinki, almost any restaurant will have pizza or some kind of spaghetti on the menu. In Italy itself, of course, all this is much broader. Each region has its own characteristics, and the menu of a particular restaurant depends rather on the chef: even on the same street, the menu is not the same everywhere (as, say, in India), but in each place it is different. On a typical menu, dishes are named descriptively, something like "fettuccine with meat sauce" or "pork chop with fried artichokes." Therefore, it is difficult to recommend trying some specific Italian dish; each establishment will have something different (in this regard, it can be compared with China).
<i>Regular restaurant:</i>

<i>More expensive restaurant in the center of Florence:</i>
<img alt="" src="images/guide-italy-842360_original.jpg" title=""/>
The menu traditionally has “first courses” and “second courses”. Italian first courses are mainly pasta with different sauces. There are also soups, but less often. There are also rice dishes (risotto), which are completely different from what I am used to in Asia. There are many types of pasta in Italy, each with its own name; for example, in the Umbria region, local strangozzi are offered everywhere. The main courses, as expected, are meat with side dishes.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-italy-840235_original.jpg" title=""/>
The menu includes appetizers (antipasti) - salads, cheese plates, sliced ​​ham (prosciutto) or sandwiches with fried bread (bruschetta).
<img alt="" src="images/guide-italy-845055_original.jpg" title=""/>
<img alt="" src="images/guide-italy-846294_original.jpg" title=""/>
Pizza is a special category. Pizza comes from Naples, in the south of the country, but is sold everywhere, both as fast food and as a replacement for a full meal in a restaurant. Pizza is a bit more standardized, at least margherita and marinara are available everywhere.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-italy-841472_original.jpg" title=""/>
The only disadvantage of food in Italy is that it is quite expensive. One dish consistently costs more than 10 euros; only the most basic pizzas are cheaper than 10. At the same time, the size of the dishes is not that large.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-italy-844750_original.jpg" title=""/>
Restaurant opening hours in Italy are unusual. Traditionally, they open for lunch around 12-15, and then for dinner after 20. In between they are not open at all. In the most touristic cities this is not observed, but in a regular city you can only eat in a restaurant (besides McDonald's) at certain hours, this is worth taking into account. There is often a “sitting fee” (coperto), something like a mandatory tip of +-2 euros.

In stores, prices are slightly higher than in <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/534835.html">Germany</a>, but lower than in <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/658207.html">France</a>. The emphasis is on local products, so the selection of Spanish jamon and French cheeses is usually quite modest.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-italy-846478_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Accomodation</b>
As expected, housing in Italy is quite expensive, and the closer it gets to summer, the more expensive it is. In winter you can find something in Rome for 30-40 euros, and in summer it will be no less than 50. In less popular cities, I paid an average of 40 euros in the summer.
In Italy, for some reason, they really like automatic check-in; in most of the places where I stayed, the keys had to be collected in some kind of box with a combination lock, and this is not only in apartments on airbnb, but also in many properties from booking.com, so you should always read messages and instructions carefully.

<b>What to see</b>
There are a lot of attractions in Italy, so this country can be explored by region - almost any region is worth a separate mini-trip. Until the second half of the 19th century, Italy was fragmented, and was finally united by 1870. There are still many differences in culture and language between the regions. Standard Italian is based on the dialect of the city of Florence. This dialect has become a lingua franca for everyone, since it is approximately halfway between the northern and southern dialects, and it is also used to write Dante's Divine Comedy, a work familiar to any educated Italian since the 16th century. Different regions use their own languages ​​in everyday life (Neapolitan, Venetian, etc.).
The north of Italy is considered richer; in the Middle Ages, trading cities like Venice and Genoa flourished there, and in general there were a lot of small states. By the 19th century, most of the northeast was under the control of the Austrian Empire, and unification began in the northwest, where the Sardinian Kingdom ruled the island of Sardinia and Piedmont.
The center of Italy, including Rome, was under the control of the Pope until the very end; now what remains of this former influence is the formal independence of the Vatican.
The south of Italy is considered poorer and more rural. This region was not so fragmented, there was almost always either one kingdom or two (on the mainland and in Sicily). All this was mostly under the influence of Spain, until the unification the Bourbon dynasty ruled Naples. In more ancient times there was both Arab and Byzantine influence (the city of Bari was Byzantine until the 11th century).
Modern Italy consists of 20 regions, I visited 12 of them. Let's go from north to south.
<b>Veneto</b> - here is the famous city of canals, Venice. It's a super touristy city with few permanent residents, but it's definitely worth a visit
<img alt="" src="images/guide-italy-846900_original.jpg" title=""/>
Treviso is the city where one of Venice's airports is located.
Vicenza is a city listed as a World Heritage Site.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-italy-849644_original.jpg" title=""/>
Verona is the city of Romeo and Juliet.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-italy-847309_original.jpg" title=""/>
Other interesting places in this region: Padua (very close to Venice), Belluno and Cortina d'Ampezzo (mountain resorts).
<b>Trentino-Alto Adige</b> is an autonomous region where German is spoken (until 1918 it was part of Austria). Here are the Dolomites:
<img alt="" src="images/guide-italy-843078_original.jpg" title=""/>
Bolzano is the capital of the German-speaking part.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-italy-847940_original.jpg" title=""/>
Trento is the capital of southern Italian-speaking part.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-italy-845899_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Lombardy</b> is the richest and most expensive region. Here is the city of Milan, which you are unlikely to pass by, since it has the largest airports and transport hubs.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-italy-843777_original.jpg" title=""/>
Bergamo is a city neighboring Milan, where the second airport is located
<img alt="" src="images/guide-italy-840920_original.jpg" title=""/>

Brescia is another large city.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-italy-848340_original.jpg" title=""/>

<img alt="" src="images/guide-italy-846847_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Liguria</b> is the Italian part of the Mediterranean Riviera. Here is one of the most picturesque cities - Genoa.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-italy-843336_original.jpg" title=""/>
There are also many resorts and picturesque towns on the coastal cliffs, such as La Spezia or Cinque Terre.
<b>Emilia-Romagna</b>. Bologna is the university and culinary capital of Italy.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-italy-841240_original.jpg" title=""/>

<img alt="" src="images/guide-italy-847598_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Lazio</b> - Rome is located here. In principle, this is enough.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-italy-845799_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Campania</b> - Naples and Pompeii are located here at the foot of Vesuvius. Nearby are the resorts of the Amalfi Coast.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-italy-844243_original.jpg" title=""/>

<img alt="" src="images/guide-italy-843580_original.jpg" title=""/>
Brindisi is a white city.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-italy-848635_original.jpg" title=""/>
It would also be nice to visit Alberobello with its beehive houses (like in <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/733996.html">Harran</a>), where I could not get to due to snowfall.


Regions where I have not been:
<b>Valle d'Aosta</b> is a small province in the mountains that has autonomous status, as they speak French. Nearby is Mont Blanc, from the French <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/654053.html">Chamonix</a> you can get here.
<b>Friuli Venezia Giulia</b> is the easternmost region near the border with Slovenia and Croatia. The main cities are Trieste and Udine. In 1918-1945 the region was larger, but now all the most interesting historical cities built by the Venetians are located in other countries - <a href="http://goo.gl/L5p5i6">Piran</a>, <a href="http://goo.gl/5s8ntz">Pula</a>, <a href="http://goo.gl/vXRoGM">Rijeka</a>, <a href="http://goo.gl/5s8ntz">Rovinj</a>, <a href="http://goo.gl/z3WBKN">Zadar</a>.
<b>Abruzzo</b> and <b>Molise</b> are mysterious little-known regions on the Adriatic coast.
<b>Basilicata</b> - here is the famous city of Matera, where I was supposed to go during the trip to southern Italy in 2017, but could not get there.
<b>Calabria</b> is the southernmost continental region. Nothing particularly remarkable.
<b>Sicily</b> is an island in the south, where there are many interesting cities (Palermo, Messina, Catania, Agrigento, Ragusa, Syracuse, Cefalu) and the Etna volcano.
<b>Sardinia</b> is a large island to the west of the main part of Italy. Famous for its resorts.
