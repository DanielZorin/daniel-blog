In the first half of September I went to Romania. The first time I was in this country was in 2014 at the end of <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/340465.html">a big trip to the Balkans</a>, and even then, despite the fatigue, this country impressed me. But somehow later I didn't have a chance to go there again thoroughly. The trip was waiting like wine in a cellar. And finally there was just enough time, and the choice of options in Europe narrowed sharply, and a ticket to neighboring Bulgaria was very cheap, and here it is. Since this is now officially one of my favorite countries in Europe, I decided to do a full review.

<b>Entry</b>
People are allowed into Romania with a Schengen visa, there are no problems with that. Restrictions related to coronavirus in Europe change almost every week - as soon as 10 people out of a million get sick somewhere, they can be put in the “red zone”, and then you require a QR code or a test. Fortunately, Romania accepts Russian Sputnik vaccination certificates, and at the beginning of September it was possible to fly even from Moscow. Bulgaria, where I came from, was sort of in the green zone, but at the border they still looked at my vaccination certificate twice.
In Romania itself, there were no restrictions in September; the local attitude to the mask regime is approximately the same as in Russia.
Until the end of August in Romania, everyone could be vaccinated with European vaccines, including foreigners, but I didn’t have time.

<b>Accomodation</b>
As usual like in other European countries, accommodation is booked through Booking.com or AirBnB. In Romania, a lot of apartments are rented through Booking, so I haven’t used AirBnB even once. Check-in is often conveniently done using mini-safes with keys on a combination lock near the entrance. Prices are quite low for Europe - a room or studio apartment costs 20-30 euros per day, for 30 euros there are already very good options, right up to an entire apartment in the historical center of Bucharest.

<b>Transport</b>
Romania stands out among the Balkan countries due to a large number of passenger trains. Not all lines, however, have frequent services, especially in Transylvania, where many areas are not electrified. The most common trains run from Bucharest east to Constanta and north to Brasov and on to Iasi or Suceava. There are several trains a day to the west to Timisoara, and the journey is long - 8-9 hours.

On trains of a class higher than local, there are fixed seats (unlike most European countries, where fixed seats are only on super-fast trains), and strangely enough, they can run out - this even happened to me when trying to leave Bucharest for Sibiu, it seems, this is the first time in Europe this has happened to me. In principle, tickets can be purchased on the website <a href="https://cfrcalatori.ro">cfrcalatori.ro</a>.
On the main lines the trains are new and comfortable; on local lines there may be old, shabby cars.

In addition to trains, there are buses of varying quality. Usually, old minibuses (similar to Russian, but German-made) travel between neighboring regions, but there are also large buses. There is a website with schedules <a href="https://autogari.ro">autogari.ro</a>, but not everything is there, and the schedules are not always correct, especially for those buses for which you cannot buy tickets online. It is safer to come to the bus station and look at the schedule there.

There is something strange going on with car rental, I looked up how much the rental costs, I was sure that it should be cheap in Eastern Europe, and there was nothing cheaper than 70 euros per day. Either everything was booked, or all the distributors conspired. In general, renting here may make sense to travel around small towns.

<b>Food</b>
The food is quite cheap, this is not France, where you can only eat for less than 10 euros at McDonald’s or an Arab shawarma shop. Lunch (business lunch) in a restaurant usually costs 25 lei / 5 euros, and this applies even to such famous historical restaurants as Hanul Manuc and Caru cu Bere in the very center of Bucharest. Unlike Russia, here the dishes at a “business lunch” do not differ in size and composition from the usual dishes on the menu, that is, when you come in the evening, you can take the same thing, although it will cost more - each dish is 3-6 euros, whereas in a business lunch there will be four at once (soup, salad, appetizer and main course).
And you won’t spend that much in the evening either. Probably the most expensive dish I ate in Romania was these ribs (Scarita) in Alba Iulia in a restaurant with a medieval interior right in the fortress wall. Cost 45 lei / 9 euros.

The food itself is essentially similar to other European countries. Perhaps the peculiarity of Romania is the love for baked cheese in the form of long sticks, a very common appetizer or even main course:
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946300644_b181cb05a0_h.jpg"/>
Often dishes are called something like “peasant dish” or “shepherd’s lunch” of cheese sticks and meat in cheese sauce:

Another specialty of Romania is mamaliga - a rather tasty porridge brought as a side dish instead of rice or potatoes. It turned out that in Russia you can also make it if you buy a grain called “polenta”, I want to try it sometime. A special chic thing is to cover it with omelette and cheese - such a side dish overshadowing even the main dish, which is visible above - Moldavian-style fried sausage (tochitura moldoveneasca).

When it comes to drinking in Romania, there is wine, beer, and strong alcohol called “tuica” here - essentially an analogue of Bulgarian rakia and Serbian plum brandy.

<b>Internet</b>
Romania probably has the cheapest Internet in Europe - for 10 dollars I got as much as 50 gigabytes of traffic, I have never seen such large packages anywhere in the world. You can buy a SIM card at a grocery store, and you don’t even need a passport, which is also very, very rare these days.

<b>What to see</b>
So, Romania is civilized, has decent transport, good hotels and restaurants, is inexpensive and there is no lockdown. But the same can be said about other countries, for example, about Poland. What else sets Romania apart is its decent size, and the abundance and variety of attractions. The architecture is especially good - this is the Europe from children's fairy tales with castles with pointed towers. Even in provincial towns, there is a historical center everywhere, many of them surprised me when I was not expecting anything special - Timisoara, Drobeta-Turnu Severin, Constanta.
I saw 15 cities in Romania: Bucharest, Giurgiu, Costanta, Sinaia, Brasov, Sighisoara, Targu Mures, Sibiu, Medias, Alba Iulia, Deva, Hunedoara, Arad, Timisoara, Drobeta-Turnu Severin
And I would be happy to see as many more, at least worth a visit: Iasi, Suceava, Bistrita, Piatra Neamt, Curtea de Arges, Horezu, Bran, Rasnov, Cluj-Napoca, Sighetu-Marmaciei, Oradea; You can also travel around the small towns of Transylvania and Bucovina.

And in terms of nature, Romania is also great: there are mountains with beautiful views, including the famous Transfagarasan Highway. In the east you can also see the Danube Delta, although this is not easy to do - I didn’t find excursions at adequate prices on the Internet, apparently, you need to go to the city of Tulcea and explore on the spot, but I didn’t have room for such a maneuver, so that’s also left for another time.
My favorite places. The most beautiful cities are, of course, in Transylvania. Sibiu:
