My trip to Mexico took place from November 7 to November 23, a total of 16 nights. During this time, I somehow visited the states: Baja California, Jalisco, Guanajuato, Queretaro, Mexico City, Distrito Federal, Puebla, Oaxaca, Guerrero, Morelos, Quintana Roo, Yucatan, Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas, a total of 14 (out of 31). I must say that most of my journey passed through regions not very often visited by European tourists. In fact, tourists are visible only on the Yucatan Peninsula, and a little in Mexico City and Oaxaca. The statistics that can be seen on the website tripster.ru are very indicative: of the users of this site 470 marked they had been in Cancun (the main resort where there are direct flights from Moscow and package tours), but only less than hakf of them (208) went to Chichen Itza, the most famous attraction region. Only 136 people made it to Merida, which is another two hours further. And, for example, only 54 were in Guadalajara.

Now I will analyze in detail all aspects of traveling in Mexico.
The currency of Mexico is the peso, one US dollar = 13 pesos. Now you need to convert it into rubles, multiplying by 3.5. In cities near the American border, dollars are freely accepted, in others - rarely and at a bad rate like 1 to 12.

<b>Border formalities</b>
You can come to Mexico without a visa by filling out an application online if you enter through the airport. If you have a US visa, you can enter in any way without any forms. If you want to enter by land from Guatemala, you need a visa (Mexican or American). Upon entry, I was charged $25 (or 306 pesos) for a migration card. When leaving, they didn’t check anything, you just had to throw 4 pesos into the turnstile to get onto the bridge. So if you enter or leave by land, theoretically you don’t have to go through border formalities.

<b>Language</b>
They speak Spanish in Mexico, and I took full advantage of the opportunity to improve my knowledge of the language. Only in the northern border cities did my interlocutors switch to English, seeing that I spoke far from perfectly. Spanish in Mexico is much clearer than Spanish in Argentina or Paraguay, and the pronunciation has much more in common with Spain.

<b>Accomodation</b>
Hotels in Mexico are very good. There's plenty of them and it's cheap. Mexico has not yet been swallowed up by the era of the Internet and booking.com, so here, unlike Europe, you can look for accommodation on the spot, which I did many times. Hotel rooms cost from 9 to 25 dollars (120-325 pesos). Single rooms, which is nice, are significantly cheaper than double rooms. You can also book through booking.com, but there is less choice, but the quality of the rooms is better. In general, for 10-15 dollars you can rent a shabby room (which, nevertheless, will not surprise a person familiar with Russian hostels and hotels), for 20 - a well-renovated one.
Through booking.com I rented accommodation in the following cities: Guadalajara, Mexico City, Puebla, Oaxaca. In Valladolid, I tried to find a room on the spot, but did not find anything cheap, and I looked up the address of the cheapest hotel through booking, connecting to the network in the square.
On the spot, I found housing in the cities of: Tijuana, Guanajuato, Queretaro, Acapulco, Merida, Nuevo Laredo. Hint: Cheap hotels are usually in the city center, near the main square, or near the bus station.
The best hotel in terms of price and quality is in Acapulco (Hotel Alameda), for just 11 dollars I got a spacious room with a private shower and even the Internet.
The worst, perhaps, is in Tijuana (Hotel Morelia), although it costs 10 dollars, but I had to wash with a bucket just like in Moscow when the hot water was turned off. And - for the first time in my extensive experience - there was no power outlet in the room!
Once I stayed in a hostel for $7.5 in Cancun, where I arrived after midnight and was planning to leave in the afternoon. It was a fun adventure that I'll tell you about another time. In general, there is no particular point in hostels, because for the same 10 dollars you can find a separate room.

<b>City transport</b>
Public transport in Mexico is very similar to Russian, and is represented mainly by buses. Buses in most cities are quite rundown and old, although in some cities there are also new ones (in Queretaro, for example). The fare is approximately the same as in Russia, from 5 to 7 pesos, in Cancun - as much as 9.5, as in Moscow. You pay the driver at the entrance; you are often given a ticket that comes off a roll. We have a better system for informing about routes at stops (although it is very far from perfect). In Mexico, as a rule, there is no information about routes at all at stops. Only on the windshield there is sloppy writing about where it is going. Luckily, most cities in Mexico are built on a rectangular grid, like those in the US and Argentina, so if you know which direction your destination is, you can figure out where the bus should go and then ask locals and drivers.
Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey, the three largest cities, have subways. A trip in Mexico City is only 5 pesos, in Guadalajara - 7, in Monterrey - 4.5 (and two trips are 8.5). In Guadalajara you need to either buy a travel card or throw coins into the turnstile, in Monterrey - plastic tickets from vending machines, in Mexico City - cardboard tickets from ticket offices.
Taxi is quite cheap. I used it once, in the creepy city of Nuevo Laredo, when the buses stopped running well after midnight; from the station to the center it cost only 50 pesos ($4).

<b>Intercity transport</b>
Surprisingly, intercity transport in Mexico is not cheap, especially compared to everything else. As in Brazil and Argentina, there are intercity buses of different classes. In Brazil the majority of buses are of the lower (regular) class, but in Mexico the majority are of the first class. In some cities, such as Guanajuato and especially Acapulco, bus monopolists only operate first class buses. In addition to first class, there is also luxury, gold, diamond and platinum, which are even more expensive. To be honest, there is practically no difference between first and second class. Many first class buses don't even have power sockets, and I only had Wi-Fi once. Even in first class, they give you a can of cola and a bun. Excellent compensation for doubling the price.
Another trouble is that schedules can often only be found on site. In Brazil and Argentina there are websites with schedules and prices for all buses from all companies. In Mexico there is something similar: ticketbus.com.mx, but it is very buggy, and not all companies are there, and half the cities are missing. The cheapest buses, as a rule, are not presented on the Internet.
First class tickets can theoretically be bought online, if you do it in advance it will be cheaper, but I didn’t try it as plans changed along the way. I always bought either before departure or in the morning for the evening, and I never had any problems with seats.
Travel prices (remember, $1 = 13 pesos)
Guadalajara - Guanajuato, 4 hours, 1st class, 390 pesos
Guanajuato - San Miguel de Allende, 1.5 hours, 1st class, 124 pesos
San Miguel - Queretaro, 1.5 hours, 2nd class, 63 pesos
Queretaro - Mexico City, 3 hours, 2nd class, 200 pesos
Mexico City - Puebla, 3 hours in traffic, 2nd class, 144 pesos
Puebla - Oaxaca, 4 hours, 1st class, 416 pesos
Oaxaca - Mexico City, 6-7 hours, 2nd class, 300 pesos (traveled by night bus)
Mexico City - Acapulco, 5 hours, 1st class, 470 pesos (extortion, but it simply doesn’t get any cheaper)
Mexico City - Cuernavaca, 1.5 hours, 1st class - 110 pesos, return 2nd class - 62 pesos
Cancun - Chichen Itza, 4 hours, 2nd class, 133 pesos
Chichen Itza - Valladolid, 1 hour, 2nd class, 26 pesos
Valladolid - Merida, 4 hours, 2nd class, 104 pesos (here I really had to go first, 200 pesos is not that expensive, but it’s really faster, but I was late for the first one’s departure)
Monterrey - Nuevo Laredo, 3.5 hours, 1st class with wi-fi, sockets and personal screen - free! I’ll tell you how it turned out below.

I also had three domestic flights around Mexico, which I managed to buy when the dollar exchange rate was around 37 rubles. There are several low-cost airlines in Mexico, and I flew with them.
Volaris: check-in at the airport is paid (albeit only 10 pesos), but there is a terminal that for some reason refused to print my boarding pass; they printed it at the counter for free. Luggage included. I flew them from Tijuana to Guadalajara.
Vivaaerobus - Mexican Ryanair. It is not available in booking systems; you can only buy it on the website (or in person in Mexico). The prices are very low, around 1000 pesos per flight, and this is without sales, it can be 500 pesos on sales. When purchasing, they offer so many hidden paid options that Ryanair can envy, try to start buying a ticket from them for fun, you’ll see. There is a fee for luggage, but it only costs about 50 pesos. Registration seems to be free, but just in case, I printed my boarding tickets at an Internet cafe. There was something strange written on the boarding gate: “With online check-in, you cannot check in your luggage,” but then I realized that this was simply an incorrect translation into English from Spanish, meaning that you cannot check in your luggage if you arrive after 45 minutes before departure to the gate. I flew them Mexico City-Cancun and Merida-Monterrey (they have a hub in Monterrey), I have no complaints.

<b>Food</b>
The food in Mexico is good. More precisely, the stores are rather bad, just like in the USA. There are two chain stores on every corner: Oxxo and the American 7-Eleven, where you can only buy cola, chips and chocolates. It's not easy to find healthier food in stores. I note that for some reason chocolates like Snickers are very expensive in Mexico, twice as expensive as in Russia, but cola is cheap. Dr Pepper is sold in many places (but not everywhere), around 9-10 pesos for a half-liter bottle. You can also buy burritos at Oxxo and heat them in the microwave there, a normal option for breakfast at 6 a.m. when nothing else works.
If you come across a fruit stand, you can grab something juicy, for example, tangerines for $1 per 2 kilos.
But in Mexico you can eat great in restaurants and eateries. There are many of them, and their prices are very reasonable. A business lunch (comida corrida) costs only 35 to 50 pesos ($3-4). If you want to go higher class, you can go to an a la carte restaurant, there will be dishes for about 5 dollars. Even cheaper at street stalls. In Oaxaca, at the bazaar, I found what seemed to be the cheapest option - tacos there cost only 2 pesos apiece! The poorer and more slummed the place, the cheaper it is.
McDonald's in Mexico is more expensive than in Russia, there is nothing to catch there. But KFC is cheaper, I even went there once in Mexico City, because there are no cheap establishments in the center, and in the evening I no longer wanted to go to the markets and outskirts.
Tequila is cheap, starting at $12 per liter. The easiest way to find it is in souvenir shops, but there is a small selection at Oxxo, and you can also find specialized stores with alcohol.

<b>Internet</b>
If your hotel does not have internet, do not despair, all Mexican cities have wi-fi in the main city square. In addition, in many places, for example, at train stations and airports, there is an Infinitum movil network. There you need a password, to get it, you just need to buy ice cream at Burger King once. login:Burgerk@infinitummovil, pass:xtreme78, works in all cities.

<b>Security</b>
Mexico is a safe country. Although it is impossible for a European to pass for a local (except for the northern regions), I never felt sideways unkind glances, I walked calmly in the dark, including through residential areas. Residents' homes are often fortified with barbed fences, but armed robberies in broad daylight, as in some other Latin American countries, are rare. Cities along the American border are traditionally considered more dangerous. There are active gangsters here who fight with each other for the right to sell cocaine to snickering Americans across the border, but this has no direct relation to tourists. In the most terrible city of Nuevo Laredo, where Las Zetas rule (these guys are famous for cutting off the heads of their enemies), there are 24-hour shops and discos.
In general, do not read American newspapers before lunch.

<b>Attractions</b>
There is a lot to see in Mexico. There are really beautiful cities and many historical places. Most of the attractions are in the south, where the distances are not so long, so you can travel around Mexico, like in Europe, with short trips. There are also natural beauties, although mainly in places remote from civilization.
Further for brevity - UWH = UNESCO World Heritage
Tijuana is a commercial border city. This is the busiest border crossing in the world.
The California Peninsula (not to be confused with the state of California, which is to the north) is UWH, a harsh rock desert, a great view from a plane flying from Tijuana.
Hospital Cabañas, Guadalajara - UWH, amazing painting of the cathedral. Yes, I’m saying this, I’m not an art critic at all, a person very far from religion and quite indifferent to all kinds of paintings, of which I’ve seen hundreds. This place is absolutely unique. Entrance 70 pesos.
Mirador Park, Guadalajara - a gorgeous view of the canyon right within the city. Entrance 4 pesos.
The city of Guanajuato, UWH is one of the most beautiful cities in the world, one of the main must-sees in Mexico.

Hierve el Agua - “stone waterfalls”, rocks that look like water from a distance. A great place, and not too crowded. Entrance is 25 pesos, another 10 pesos are charged to repair the road leading to the park. Travel from Mitla by shared taxi is 40-50 pesos one way, depending on how many people are traveling.
The Ahuehuete tree is the thickest tree in the world. Located in the town of Santa Maria del Tule, near Oaxaca (bus fare 6 pesos). Entrance 10 pesos
Monte Alban - UWH, extensive ruins of an ancient city on top of a mountain. There is tourist transport from the center for about 60 pesos, but I took a public bus to the final stop and then walked for about 40 minutes along the road with gorgeous views. Entrance 59 pesos.

<img alt="Guanajuato_025" src="images/guide-mexico-3010_original.jpg" title="Guanajuato_025"/>

From what I did not visit, but in my opinion deserves special attention:
Volcano Paricutin is an active volcano, it recently erupted, there should be fields of frozen lava around.
Tequila - agave is grown on plantations there, from which the drink tequila is made.
Copper Canyon - Grand Canyon in Mexico.
Historic cities of Morelia, Zacatecas, San Luis Potosí, San Cristobal, Campeche, Taxco de Alarcón.
Mexico City's "city of garbage", an attraction not for the faint of heart.


In just 16 days, I spent 10,726 pesos (about $800), an average of almost exactly $50 per day. The most money was spent on travel - $291, or 36%. Hotels spent $247, 30%, an average of $15.5 per day. For food - $164 (20%), and $104 for everything else, like museum entrance and souvenirs.</lj-cut>
