In the 16th century, the Portuguese were the first Europeans to colonize what is now Indonesia. Then the Dutch ousted them, but one piece remained on the island of Timor, which remained with Portugal until the liberation of all colonies in 1975. Immediately, East Timor was occupied by Indonesia, with the consent of other powers that did not want the emergence of a new communist state. In 1998, a revolution occurred in Indonesia, the new authorities allowed a referendum on independence to be held, but they were very offended by the results, and upon leaving, they demolished most of the infrastructure, driving East Timor to the very bottom. Now it is still the most miserable and poorest country in Southeast Asia.

<b>Visa and entry</b>
There are flights to East Timor from three places: Singapore (very expensive and not every day), Darwin (Australia, with a Russian passport there is little chance of getting there) and Bali. A round-trip ticket from Bali costs about 230 US dollars, if you buy it on the Air Timor website. More expensive on other sites. There are flights on Sriwijaya air and their subsidiary NAM air, they cost about the same (1.5 million rupees), but for some reason they are not available on ticket search engines. There are three flights a day from Bali, and they depart at approximately the same time.
There is also a land border with Indonesia, but there is no point in going there. The fact is that at Dili airport a visa is issued upon arrival for 30 US dollars, and at the land border you also need to have an invitation, which, although it is possible to obtain, is very tedious, since you need to correspond for a long time with some Timorese officials who are not very punctual. And a ticket to Kupang + 10 hours by bus to the border is not much cheaper. There is even less benefit in the opposite direction, because you need to get an Indonesian visa in Dili, this in itself costs 50 dollars + you need to live in Dili for several days, and this is not a cheap “pleasure”.

<b>Money</b>
US dollars are in use. Local coins - centavos - are used as small change. $1 banknotes are rare in Timor. They accepted them without problems, but they never gave me change; instead, they give me 100 centavos coins, or a bunch of 50 or 25 centavos coins.
ATMs, of course, also dispense dollars. I managed to withdraw $500 at a time, although it turned out to be a pack of twenties - inconvenient for long-term storage.

<b>Language</b>
East Timor has four languages. Two official ones: Tetum and Portuguese, and two working ones: English and Indonesian. Let me explain the situation.
There are many different peoples living on the island of Timor, some speak Austronesian languages (related to Indonesian), others speak Papuan languages (related to other languages of New Guinea). The Tetum language was the means of international communication on the island before colonization. Nowadays, quite a lot of people speak real Tetum - residents of West Timor, which belongs to Indonesia. In East Timor, the language used is "Tetun-Dili", which originated from the capital Dili. This language is Portuguese-Tetum pigeon, where at least half of the words are taken from Portuguese and written as if in phonetic transliteration: nasoins, avizu, kartaun and so on. Tetun-Dili is the lingua franca of East Timor, including speakers of other Tetum dialects who live mainly on the southern coast.
Since East Timor was part of Indonesia from 1975 to 1999, the official language was then Indonesian. It was left as a "working" language, and you can see signs and announcements in Indonesian. In addition, most of the goods are imported from Indonesia, and, of course, no one alters the labels.
After the end of the Indonesian occupation, Timor was governed for several years by UN peacekeeping forces, hence, apparently, the “working” status of the English language. With a local you have the best chance of communicating in English.
What attracted me most was the opportunity to speak Portuguese. In practice, it's hard. While the Portuguese owned Timor, they did not really teach the Timorese their language, although they contributed to the emergence of the local pigeon. After liberation from Indonesia, Portuguese was made the official language according to the principle “as long as it is not the language of the occupiers.” Office work is conducted in Portuguese simply because it contains all the necessary smart words that may not exist in Tetun-Dili. Many inscriptions and signs are in Portuguese. But for locals it’s a foreign language: finding a person who speaks Portuguese is not easy (but I managed). Yes, they also play songs in Portuguese in the minibuses.


<b>Accomodation</b>
The housing situation is terrible. There used to be two hostels in Dili, one of them recently closed, leaving only Casa Minha, which is suddenly run by Bangladeshis. The conditions are not very good: no air conditioning, no proper shower (only a shower with cold water), and, of course, no internet either. For breakfast they serve fried noodles or rice, without meat, of course. A bed in a dormitory costs $12. For this money in Bali you can rent a room in a chain hotel with all imaginable amenities. A double room costs $25. In other cities, everything is even worse - there are no hostels, for the same $25 you will be offered a shed without air conditioning and running water, which in Laos would cost $3, which is the real price for housing with this level of comfort.
The best place to stay in Dili is in the ATM booth of the Portuguese bank Caixa, where the air conditioning works great.

<b>Transport</b>
Roads in East Timor are in poor condition, but not incredibly bad. That is, you drive normally for a while, then bam - the section is completely broken up, the bus rolls from wheel to wheel over the potholes. However, intercity buses run quite quickly: the 120 kilometers from Dili to Baucau are consistently covered in three hours. For comparison, in Indonesia to Java I once traveled a similar distance for six hours. A plus for Timor is the almost complete absence of populated areas and, accordingly, stops in them, as well as acceleration to 60-70 on flat sections of the road. On the minus side are broken sections and sections going through the mountains.
Of course, there are no air conditioners on the buses, but at least the windows open normally. This is especially important in connection with mass smoking on the bus (more widespread than in Indonesia). Buses run frequently between Dili and Baucau; I never waited longer than 10 minutes. It is more difficult to get to the edge of the island.

Minibuses run around the cities of Dili and Baucau, just like in Indonesian cities with convenient transport (Manado, Balikpapan, Padang, etc.). There are even route numbers, each route is painted in its own color. Minibuses 1 (red) and 2 (green) go to the bus station, from where buses go to the east. Minibuses 10 (white) and 11 (also white, but with a stripe on the side) go towards the airport. The fare is 25 cents.

<b>Food</b>
The food is so bad that you can’t even believe you’re in Asia. Eating out is more expensive than even in Singapore. There are unattractive canteens (such as Indonesian warungs), where food costs about twice as much as in Indonesia. Restaurant prices are 5-10 times higher than in Indonesia. For example, the classic dish Nasi Goreng (fried rice) in Indonesia costs 10,000 rupees, or 15,000 if you are near the top of Bromo volcano. In a canteen in Dili, Nasi Goreng costs $1.50-2, that is, 20,000-25,000 rupees, and in a restaurant, $6 = 80,000 rupees. I haven't found food cheaper than $1.5.

Among civilized food places, there are at least three Burger Kings in Dili. In general, Burger King is more expensive than McDonald's, but they often have very nice promotions, for example, in Moscow you can eat there with promotional coupons for half the price of Mac. Indonesia also has some good promotional offers that are not listed on the main menu. But not in Dili - this is the lamest Burger King in the world, and one of the most expensive. The Whopper menu costs as much as $6.75. Moreover, if you take “large”, they still give a pitiful 0.33 cola in a can, even without ice. And the most annoying thing is that I went there because I needed normal internet, but Wi-fi turned out to be very slow, much worse than the internet from my phone.
In the store you can buy Indonesian products: cookies, chips, noodles at prices slightly higher than in Indonesia. For example, a can of cola or ice cream costs $0.50 = 6500 rupees, in Indonesia 4000-4500. A half-liter bottle of water costs $0.25 = 3250 rupees, in Indonesia 2000-3000. A pack of OREO cookies costs $0.70 = 9000 rupees, in Indonesia 8000-8500 (and in Thailand it's more expensive, $0.80-0.85).
There is almost no fruit. Stores sell apples and oranges for 3-4 dollars per kilogram. Vendors walk the streets with green oranges (or tangerines?) for $2 for four pieces. Watermelon, papaya and soursop are still occasionally found in the stalls.
I understood what the locals eat when I saw on the bus how a girl ate a pack of Indonesian noodles for 2000 rupees ($0.15) straight in dry form.

<b>Internet</b>
Internet in East Timor is available in the form of 3G from mobile operators. There are three of them, their tariffs are the same, I took Telkomsel (apparently a branch of the Indonesian operator of the same name). The prices are as follows: the card costs $1, and $1 costs unlimited internet for 24 hours. There are offers for a week or a month, but for me it was the most useful for three days. 3G is available only in Dili, in other cities only 2G. Apparently, the network is overloaded, which is why the download speed is very low - 20-30 kilobits per second, but the upload speed is close to 1 megabit per second. However, the mobile network supports voice Skype, and over the evening I downloaded a new episode of Game of Thrones.

<b>Entertainment</b>
Frankly, there is only one reason to go to East Timor - +1 to the list of countries visited. There is nothing to see in this country. Colonial architecture was initially scarce, but the war also destroyed it. There are beaches somewhere very far away, there are small mountains, but all this is absolutely unattractive against the backdrop of Indonesia, which you still can’t avoid on the way. Roughly speaking, while in Bali you can fly to Makassar for $60 and see this there:

Or, for $250, fly to East Timor, where everything is 2-3 times more expensive, lousy housing, poor food, and well, you get the idea.
