Georgia holds a special place in my heart. Although I do not live there permanently, it happens that I have quite a few Georgian official documents, and my life is partially connected with this country. I can say that Georgia is like a favorite vacation place for me, where I periodically come to hang out, drink lemonade and eat barbecue.
I have been to Georgia four times: in May 2014, June 2022, November 2022 and June 2023.

<b>Visa</b>
Georgia has an absolutely unique visa policy: not only can you live as long as you like, just hopping to a neighboring country for an hour periodically, but you also need to do this only once a year (in Serbia or Thailand, people do/have done visa runs every month). 365 days of visa-free travel are not allowed anywhere else. Moreover, in Georgia there are no “work visas” at all; if you enter under a visa-free regime, in principle you can get a job anywhere absolutely legally and without any permits! All bureaucratic services are not tied to citizenship/residence permit, for example, foreigners can easily obtain a driver’s license, get married in one day, register as an individual entrepreneur and pay taxes. Georgia is probably the most libertarian country in the world. On the other hand, due to such libertarian entry rules, residence permits are issued reluctantly, which creates some problems (for example, without a residence permit you cannot apply for Schengen visa).

There are three international airports in Georgia: Tbilisi, Kutaisi, Batumi. Most major legacy airlines fly into Tbilisi. Kutaisi offers cheap tickets to many European countries thanks to the Hungarian low-cost airline Wizz Air. There are few flights to Batumi, especially in winter they are mostly from Turkey; in summer more destinations are added.
From Turkey you can enter by land at the major crossing between Trabzon to Batumi, as well as through two small crossings in the mountains in the Kars region (there is no public transport on those roads though).
From Armenia, the main road between Yerevan and Tbilisi passes through Sadakhlo border crossing; buses go there very often. There are two other less popular border crossings. There are also sleeper trains from Yerevan to Tbilisi and Batumi, but not every day.
The border with Azerbaijan is still closed under the pretext of fighting Covid-19. Previously there were trains from Baku to Tbilisi.
From the north there is one border crossing in the mountains (Upper Lars).
Two parts of Georgia (Abkhazia and South Ossetia) are currently self-proclaimed states. It seems that you can enter Abkhazia from the southeast, although this requires a special permit; you can only enter South Ossetia from the north.

<b>Money</b>
The currency of Georgia is called lari, 1 dollar = 2.6 lari. Lari over the last year not only did not fall, but even strengthened from 3 to 2.6, which led to some increase in price from the point of view of tourists.
Georgian ATMs readily dispense not only lari, but also U.S. dollars, which is rare these days. The easiest option is Bank of Georgia ATMs, almost all of them have dollars, and you can withdraw up to 500 at a time with an ATM fee of only $1. There are also dollars in ATMs of TBC Bank (they ask for a commission in %), Basis Bank (300 at a time) and Halyk Bank (previously they dispansed up to $1000 at a time without a commission, but now the commission is 1%).
It is possible for a non-resident to open an account in Georgia. In general, Georgian banks do not really want “card tourists”. They may close the account for the transit of money (especially from Russia), using the card only for online purchases or abroad, as well as for the purchase and sale of cryptocurrency. Since the country is small, there are only about 10 banks. The two largest one are Bank of Georgia and TBC, but it can be difficult to open account there because they have lengthy KYC procedures. The easier ones are Credo Bank and Basis Bank (the latter requires you to live at least three months in Georgia before opening an account).

<b>Accomodation</b>
International tourism has been on the rise in Georgia for quite some time, there are a lot of hotels and apartments for rent. In Tbilisi, even during summer, I didn’t have the slightest problem finding a decent apartment in the city center for $25-30 a day; it can be cheaper if you’re further away from the center. In Batumi you can rent apartments in the Orbi skyscrapers. I was there in the off-season, and it was cheap (the same $25 per day), in the summer it is of course more expensive. There are many hotels in small towns too, the quality is generally high, so traveling in Georgia is very convenient.
A room in a cheap guesthouse in Tbilisi costs 35-40 lari ($13-15), and a bed in a hostel is around for 15 lari.

<b>Food</b>
I really like Georgian food. Most restaurants serve Georgian cuisine, and the menu is quite standard. The most common dish is of course the barbecue, or <i>mtsvadi</i> (<i>shashlyk</i> in Russian). A big pork skewer costs approximately 16-18 lari ($6-7).

<i>Khachapuri</i> are huge cheese pies. The most famous is the Adjarian one, shaped like a boat, but I like the Mingrelian ones better, because you don't have to mix and stir the cheese. Adjarian is usually cheaper around 13 lari, Mingrelian and Imeretian cost 15-16 lari.

<img alt="" src="images/guide-georgia-836679_original.jpg" title=""/>
<i>Khinkali</i> are large bell-shaped dumplings. They cost about 1.3-1.5 GEL, but you have to order at least five.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-georgia-834767_original.jpg" title=""/>
Other dishes are mainly prepared in <i>ketsi</i> (clay frying pans). Various kinds of roast or mushrooms with <i>suluguni</i> cheese.

Menu of a regular restaurant in a non-tourist place:

The products in the stores are quite varied, you can even find imports from Europe like Spanish jamon.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-georgia-833197_original.jpg" title=""/>
Goods from Ukraine are available too. Prices are mostly higher than in Turkey, especially for dairy products.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-georgia-835852_original.jpg" title=""/>
I really like Georgian lemonades, especially with the taste of pear and cream soda. This is a kind of local brand created by Mitrofan Lagidze back in the 19th century. Now, of course, it’s easier to buy a bottle of one of the brands like <i>Natakhtari, Kazbegi, Zedazeni</i>. The lemonades are so good that I even order them for delivery in Turkey.

<b>Transport</b>
There are trains in Georgia, both sleeper and seated, but buying tickets for them is not easy; you need to do this on the website in advance. Tbilisi - Kutaisi - Batumi trains are in great demand, as they are faster and more convenient than buses.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-georgia-833984_original.jpg" title=""/>
I only traveled by minibuses. Not sure if they have a fixed schedule. The price is approximately 5 GEL per hour of travel, for example:
Tbilisi to Sachkhere - 15 GEL
Tbilisi to Kutaisi - 20 GEL
Tbilisi to Batumi - 35 GEL
Tbilisi to Yerevan - 40 GEL
Batumi to Poti - 10 GEL
Tbilisi has two subway lines, many buses and three cable cars; travel costs 1 GEL (you need a stored-value travel card).
<img alt="" src="images/guide-georgia-836544_original.jpg" title=""/>
There is a huge number of cable cars in Georgia; I tried three in Tbilisi, three in Chiatura, one in Kutaisi and one in Batumi. I saw abandoned Soviet cable cars in other cities (Gurjaani, Rustavi, aforementioned Chiatura).
<img alt="" src="images/guide-georgia-837227_original.jpg" title=""/>
Taxis in Georgia are quite cheap. Bolt and Yandex are the most common applications. Trips around Tbilisi/Batumi cost 3-10 GEL, even very long ones.


<b>Internet</b>
I use the Magti operator. Their tariffs are very simple: one day of unlimited internet costs 2 GEL, a week costs 9 GEL, 30 days cost 32 GEL. A new SIM card costs 10 GEL.
To keep your number active, it's enough to top it up by 1 lari once every two months.
There are two other operators - Silknet and Cellfie.


<b>Where to go</b>
Tbilisi is one of my favorite cities in the world. Thanks to the layout, there are a lot of breathtaking views, just like in Rio de Janeiro; a lot of interesting architecture from different eras, restaurants and other entertainment.
