So, ladies and gentlemen, today it’s time for another post in the <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/tag/money">section of reviews of infrastructure and prices in different countries</a>. Thailand - there is so much in this word. I had never been there before, because I thought that in this pop country there was nothing except prostitution and beach resorts. This is partly true: going to Thailand for 1-2 weeks in the format that I did before is quite pointless - you won’t see anything particularly outstanding, and you won’t have time to taste the food and atmosphere. But if you come for longer, it’s very pleasant to leisurely travel around the country, and if you know how the system works, it’s very cheap.

Bangkok - 9 nights (2 before leaving for Moscow and 7 after returning)
Lopburi - 1 night
Ayutthaya - 2 nights
Nakhon Ratchasima - 4 nights
Nakhon Pathom - 1 night
Kanchanaburi - 3 nights
Hua Hin - 2 nights
Chumphon - 1 night
Phang Nga - 2 nights
Patong - 5 nights


<b>Money</b>
$1 = 35 baht. At some point it was 36, and it was at that moment that I changed money in Bangkok at Siam Exchange (the best rate is there).
ATMs give out decent amounts, but charge a commission of around $5, just like in Cambodia.
In general, it is probably correct to say “one hundred baht” rather than “one hundred baht”, but it is very natural to abbreviate it by analogy with “one hundred grams”, so I will write “baht”. Sorry, Grammar Nazi.

<b>Language</b>
The Thai alphabet is something. Let me make an analogy. Everyone probably knows that before 1918, Russian spelling was somewhat more complex, in particular there were four more letters: i, yat, fita and izhitsa, although these letters denoted the same sounds as the letters I, E, F, I respectively. And before Peter I, spelling was even more complex; the original alphabet, invented by Cyril and Methodius a thousand years ago, was used. Some of the letters denoted sounds that have disappeared (like yat, which was once slightly different from E), some were originally duplicates, because they were taken from Greek (like Izhitsa). So, the Thai alphabet is as if the Russian alphabet had not undergone these two reforms. It is probably not easy for poor Thais to learn to write without errors, because for one sound there can be three or four letters at the beginning of a syllable, and six to eight at the end.
Thai has tones, but they are not nearly as important as Vietnamese or Chinese because Thai words are long (hello Nakhon Ratchasima!). It is more important to correctly pronounce aspirated consonants and distinguish between long and short vowels.
In the provinces, most people do not understand English (neither in hotels nor in public catering), that is, the situation in this area seemed to me a little worse than in Cambodia and Vietnam, but better than in China. There are no problems at train stations, even in unconventional cities it’s easy to find out when the bus will arrive.

<b>Housing</b>
Hotels in Thailand are, as they say, hit or miss. You can go to a chic place, or you can go to a creepy one, for the same price. On my first day in Bangkok, I arrived late in the evening and wanted to check in quickly, so I went to the first place I came across on Khao San Street (where budget hotels are concentrated), the price was only 200 baht ($6), but the quality turned out to be simply enchanting. For six months I was quite spoiled in terms of the quality of hotels, and if in countries unsuitable for tourism (such as the USA) I settled in dull places for lack of others, then over this year that Thai hotel simply set a record for dullness: a barely lit “room” the size , like in Hong Kong, with wooden walls covered with peeling paint, an iron prison table and a bed without even a blanket or bedspread. It was also right next to Khao San, so the music was blaring like a disco all night. It's good that I didn't catch a cold under the fan. The next day I did some reconnaissance and found a pretty nice place for 350 baht ($10) with air conditioning. True, there was not perfect soundproofing and very poor Internet, so I even went to my first hotel for normal speed. The third time I found a place with air conditioning, a hot shower and normal internet for 400 baht (Kawin Place). What is important in this area is that it has blank walls.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-thailand-49227_original.jpg" title=""/>


In general, in the country, a room with air conditioning costs 300 baht ($8.5), without air conditioning - 200. If you look hard enough, you can find it even cheaper. Some Thai hotels reminded me of shabby motels from old films about America (the kind you can now find in neighboring Mexico), others surprised me with their coziness and comfort. In my opinion, I have never photographed so many hotel rooms in any country before, perhaps I will even do a special story about it. The apotheosis was a place in the city of Patong - the resort capital of the most popular Thai island of Phuket. Spacious studio apartment with air conditioning, refrigerator, hot shower, internet - for only 240 baht per day! This immediately rehabilitated Thailand for all its past mistakes. Let me tell you: it’s simply called “The Guesthouse”. True, in January the same room costs five times more, 1200 baht, so the moral is very simple: do not go to Thai resorts during the season, which lasts from November to February.

<b>Transport</b>
I preferred to travel by train when possible. Firstly, trains are more comfortable than buses, you don’t get motion sickness in them, you can even work. Secondly, railway stations are always located in the city center, and bus stations are almost always somewhere in the outskirts, where it is inconvenient to get to. Thirdly, Ordinary class trains are simply incredibly cheap: one hour (on average 50 kilometers) journey costs about 10 baht ($0.3). For example, Chinese low-speed trains are three times more expensive, and in China I didn’t complain at all about the fare! There are also Rapid and Express class trains. As far as I understand, on Rapid a ticket for a seated carriage costs 50 baht more than on Ordinary, regardless of the distance. I have never traveled on express trains. It seems that the seats in the carriages are air-conditioned. In addition to seated carriages, there are also reserved seats and compartments, a reserved seat is somewhat cheaper than the most expensive VIP bus, a compartment (for two people) is somewhat more expensive. The cheapest trains do not travel across the entire country, but they exist between neighboring major cities, so with stops you can travel from Chiang Mai to Malaysia on such a train.
There are several branches, all starting in Bangkok. Line north to Chiang Mai. Two branches to the northeast: to Nong Khai on the border with Laos and to Ubon Ratchathani. To the east there are trains to Aranyaprathet on the Cambodian border and to Pattaya (one train at 6 am, very convenient). Head west to Kanchanaburi. And south through Hua Hin, Surat Thani, Hat Yai to Malaysia along two routes: from the west to Kuala Lumpur and from the east. Trains, especially Ordinary, do not run very often; there may be breaks of 2-3 hours, so it is better to check the schedule on the website in advance. Tickets begin to be sold an hour before departure (you can also buy tickets in advance for express trains).
If there is no train, welcome to the bus. The bus stations are very similar to Russian ones; there is even a map of the region with routes. Usually, buses run from the bus station around the region and to neighboring regional centers, and long-distance flights can also transit. In addition to regular buses (traditional ones, without glass), there are also minibuses; they can be based at the same bus station, or maybe somewhere else. The system may not be obvious. For example, in Nakhon Pathom I wanted to go to Kanchanaburi, I found a bus station (for once it’s not completely on the outskirts), but there were no buses there in Kanchanaburi, I was advised to go back to the highway going through the city center and catch a minibus. The first minibus that passed by took me to the minibus station about 3 kilometers from the city center, from where I got to where I needed to be. In the city of Ratchaburi, I wanted to go from the bus station to Hua Hin or at least to the neighboring regional center of Phetchaburi, which is on the way there, but there were no buses, I was advised to again go out onto the highway and catch a passing minibus to Phetchaburi (there I already changed to a train) .
You usually need to pay the ticket inspector on the bus; sometimes a ticket is issued at the bus station in the office. The fare is low, about 1 baht per kilometer. Once I took a more expensive bus, from Chumphon to Phuket, it cost about 1.5 baht per kilometer. The bus had wi-fi, plus upon boarding you were given a voucher for lunch at a roadside canteen.
On Khao San Road and in other tourist places, travel agencies sell bus tickets (as in Vietnam), prices there are much higher, up to 3 baht per kilometer. For example, from Hua Hin to Phuket it costs 1100 baht (travel all day) or 1300 (travel at night), but I got there for 100 (train to Chumphon) + 280 (bus to Phang Nga) + 70 (bus to Phuket) = 450 baht. It is interesting that Khao San has abnormally low prices for buses specifically to Chiang Mai - only 300 baht, while in the same company a ticket to Sukhothai, which is located exactly on the road to Chiang Mai, but much closer, costs 600 baht. As far as I understand, the scam is that you will first be shaken out of a lot of money for food in restaurants along the way (and the bus will drive very slowly on purpose), and just before Chiang Mai the bus will “break down”, after which you will have to pay the taxi drivers, and all the savings will disappear.
As for urban transport, everything is not very good. After all, Thailand is a third world country when it comes to infrastructure; to China, like to the moon. Urban transport is available only in Bangkok (well, in fact, it is the only large city in Thailand), in the form of several metro lines that ignore the central part of the city (but serve the airport, business center and northern bus station), public ferries on and across the river and buses . On buses without air conditioning, travel costs only 6.5 baht, with air conditioning it is more expensive - 13. Buses run at long intervals, if in China I knew that I would be on the route in 10 minutes, then in Bangkok you can walk for 30 or 40 minutes, it will pass by several buses in a row on the wrong route, but yours still won’t arrive. Just like in Russia!
In other cities, everything is sad: transport, at best, is represented by minibuses without numbers and stops, about the same as in the Philippines. The minibuses (songthaeo) look different, at least you don’t have to crawl into them on your knees, you can stand up to your full height.
Metered taxis are only available in Bangkok. There is no point in talking to taxi drivers standing still, especially near Khao San. When I first arrived in Bangkok late in the evening, near the metro they offered me a ride to Khao San for 500 baht! I bargained for a tuk-tuk for 100, which is still an inflated price: during the day, a taxi on the meter will cost about 60 baht, if there are no traffic jams (the drive is only 4 km), with traffic jams it will run up to 90, because the meter is also ticking for standing in traffic jams. You need to catch a passing taxi.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-thailand-49582_original.jpg" title=""/>
In Phuket, taxi drivers are completely crazy; for 6 km from Karon to Patong they demand 300 baht ($8). By bus only with a long detour through Phuket Town. And in Karon there are no motorcycle taxis at all, which I was counting on (in Patong - on every corner), so I had to walk.
Many people advise renting a motorcycle, but I don’t see the point. This greatly increases your chances of getting into trouble (from zero to some amount). Moreover, all the cities are small, you can walk right through them. If you are tired, you can take a motorcycle taxi; at one time it will be cheaper than the cost of renting for the whole day. If you don’t live in the middle of nowhere, you don’t need to go somewhere every day. In a month I only used a taxi a couple of times and did not suffer from it at all.

<b>Food</b>
In my opinion, the main reason to come to Thailand in Southeast Asia is not the sea, which is the same as everywhere else, not the ancient sights, which are moderately interesting, not the nature, which is no worse in neighboring countries (especially in Indonesia and Philippines). This is exactly food. In Thailand, I am ready to live in any city, even a provincial one, I don’t care about the sea, the main thing is that there are Thai canteens and markets there. Better than in Thailand, only in China (because there is more choice).
<img alt="" src="images/guide-thailand-49809_original.jpg" title=""/>

I mostly consumed Thai food in canteens (mini-restaurants, as you like) similar to Chinese ones. Many menus are only in Thai (sometimes in the form of a list of 5-6 dishes on the wall, sometimes a full menu). I experimented with ordering dishes at random, and one time I was really unlucky: I poked at boiled chicken feet, which I couldn’t eat. Usually they bring soup with noodles, vegetables and different types of meat: minced meat, balls, pieces. Where the menu is larger, there are also dishes with fried rice or fried noodles. As a rule, the additive is offered with a choice of chicken, pork, shrimp or squid. The prices are very reasonable: a dish in such a restaurant costs 30-40 baht. The portions are small, I usually took two dishes (in China one was enough, but even taking this into account in China it turns out to be a little more expensive). In resort areas like Patong or Hua Hin it is a little more expensive - closer to 50 per dish.

<img alt="" src="images/guide-thailand-50859_original.jpg" title=""/>
Restaurants for 30-40 baht are the most common option. If you look more closely, you can find restaurants that are a little more expensive, where dishes will cost 60-80 baht, but the variety of the menu will be close to Chinese. It’s definitely worth going to these ones too.

<img alt="" src="images/guide-thailand-50625_original.jpg" title=""/>
Finally, there are establishments for vacationers that are incredibly expensive - the same tom yum soup for 35 baht costs 180 (just like the price in Europe), breakfast “whatever you like” of two toasts with jam and coffee costs 150. Especially there is a lot of this stuff in Bangkok on Khao San Street, but even there, within walking distance, you can find normal places where prices are 30 percent higher than usual, no more. There is no need to go to such places unless you want to spend as much money as possible.
All these canteen restaurants close relatively early, so if you arrive in the evening, you need to go to the night market. Everything there is about the same, but you can’t always sit down at a table; they often sell take-out rice/noodles in boxes. Also in the assortment of night markets are kebabs (including squid) from 5 baht for the smallest (roughly Chinese prices), sushi for 5 baht apiece (every 11th is free), fried fish for about 100 baht apiece.
If it’s too far to the night market and you’re too lazy to go, then there’s always a magical 7-11 store at the end. During the day it is useful for cooling because it has air conditioning. And at night you can buy something to eat there at any time. There are dishes with spicy rice and spaghetti for the same 35-40 baht, which can be heated in the microwave.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-thailand-50101_original.jpg" title=""/>

To complete the picture, I’ll add that in Thailand there is a very expensive McDuck and a very affordable KFC, where a pack with two pieces of chicken, potatoes and cola costs 90 baht (a good alternative if everything else is closed or you’re too tired to go to the night market), however, in In Bangkok and Phuket the price magically doubles.
Fresh elite seafood is very expensive, for example, lobsters are as much as 1800 baht per kilo (in China almost half the price), apparently I did not get to the places where they are caught and sold at a normal price.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-thailand-50308_original.jpg" title=""/>
Now about retail. The two main chains of grocery supermarkets are Tesco and Big C. The range is solid, even including imports from Europe, for example, brie cheese straight from France at crazy prices. Any decent city will have at least one of these supermarkets within walking distance of the center. In Bangkok in particular, from Khao San you can walk to Tesco in Chinatown or take a bus to the nearest metro, where there is a larger Tesco and Big C.
7-11 has practically killed the small-scale trade in chips and doshirak, which is so popular in China. In addition to the above-mentioned microwave dishes, at Seven I often bought iced coffee for 20 baht, Coke for 13 baht for a local or 17 for a Pepsi, Oreo cookies for 30 baht, a Slurpee soft drink from the machine for 12 baht, and Topten ice cream for 15 baht. . At least there is ice cream in Thailand (unlike the Philippines, Cambodia, Vietnam), but the choice is still very meager: there are only 10 varieties. All "sevens" are filled with Magnum for 50 baht, and other types may be running out.
Interestingly, the Thai "seven" has very low margins compared to regular convenience stores in other countries. For example, Oreo cookies for 30 baht in a supermarket like Tesco are sold for 29, or at best 28.
Of course, in retail I was primarily interested in fruits. There is competition with the market: something is cheaper on the market, something in Tesco, you have to look. Autumn has arrived and the fruit season has ended, making durians and mangosteens very difficult to find and prices high. Longkong was the cheapest - from 25 baht per kilo. At the end of the season in early September, mangosteens in Tesco were selling for 40, then rose to 70 and disappeared from almost everywhere. In Patong, in the largest shopping center you can buy any fruit, but the prices for almost everything are outrageous: mangosteens cost 200 baht, for example. On Khao San, carts will offer you the same mangosteens for 200 baht per bag of four pieces (in Moscow you can buy them cheaper at ABC of Taste). Durians in season should cost 50 baht per kilo of unpeeled ones, but I found only 80 at the market in Bangkok across the river (not far from Thonburi train station). In Patong, not far from home, they sold it for 120 per kilo, and they gave me a small discount as a regular customer. Durians should be bought unpeeled, because ready-made pieces covered with plastic wrap are twice as expensive, even in the same place. Cleaning service is provided on site free of charge.
At the end of the month I suddenly realized that I had never even tried Thai beer or other alcohol. In general, in such a climate you are not at all drawn to alcohol; even instead of beer it is always more pleasant to take a smoothie. I don’t understand how some people manage to waste a lot of money on alcohol. It is better to go to Cambodia for beer; in Thailand it is much more expensive - $1 in a store, $2 in a bar.

<b>Internet</b>
Most hotels have Wi-fi and it works quite reliably (unlike Cambodia). Where he was, I never complained about the speed. Some hotels (especially in non-tourist cities) may not have Wi-fi; in this case, 3G comes to the rescue.
Mobile Internet in Thailand is much more expensive than in Cambodia and Vietnam, but Skype is better. I used the True move operator, its tariffs are slightly lower. A SIM card costs 49 baht, they didn’t ask for a passport. I bought it before leaving for Moscow, and topped up my account when I returned. The “tourist SIM card” of this operator is sold and advertised everywhere, but it is very unprofitable: it gives 1 gigabyte for 2 weeks for 400 baht, whereas at the regular rate I received 1 gigabyte for a month for 300 baht. When the traffic runs out, the Internet is not cut off, but the speed is reduced to 128, so you can live with this.
What’s also nice is that along with the Internet package you get free access to Wi-Fi points of the TrueMove operator (you just need to figure out how to register and receive a password via SMS, it’s better to google the required command). This is the largest network of Wi-Fi points, in particular, they are in all the ubiquitous 7-11 stores.

<b>Entertainment</b>
I haven’t traveled all over Thailand yet, so I won’t write in detail about the sights. When I consider myself competent, I will write a separate post about where to go. For now there will be general words.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-thailand-50969_original.jpg" title=""/>

There are many times more foreign tourists in Thailand than in any other Asian country, and of course, the Thais could not help but take advantage of such popularity. In practice, this means that you need to try to distance yourself as much as possible from the bulk of both package and backpackers, otherwise it will seriously affect your costs. I have already mentioned above about the exorbitant prices in restaurants with European food (welcome to Cambodia for this) and tourist buses (but in Vietnam they are very good in price and quality). In the Philippines, a tuk-tuk ride will cost less than a taxi, but in Thailand it will be much more expensive, no matter how you haggle.
Here we can add the fact that tickets to all museums and parks for foreigners are 5-10 times more expensive. What is surprising is not the fact of discrimination (this happens in many countries), but its scale. Luckily, even ten times the price is usually acceptable (100 baht = $3). The only place I didn't go to specifically because of the price was the Royal Palace in Bangkok (500 baht), but instead visited the palaces in Bang Pain (100 baht) and Nakhon Pathom (50 baht).
I had the opportunity to compare the tourist services of Thailand and Vietnam almost in laboratory conditions: a tour of Ha Long Bay vs a tour of Phang Nga Bay (everywhere in the booklets they write “James Bond Island”). Visually, these two places are very similar. The comparison was clearly not in favor of Thailand: the “guide” did not speak English, lunch consisted of rice with chicken from the market for 30 baht and bananas, you don’t control the kayak yourself (in Vietnam this part was much more fun), the price is twice as high ($35 vs. $18). But if you take this excursion in Phuket (and not in the nearest city of Phang Nga), it will be worse: the price is a little higher, at least 3-4 hours will be spent on the road, which means you will see much less, plus people there are crowded into boats, don’t mess around .
But the devil is not so scary. If in Vietnam and Cambodia it is difficult to leave the tourist trail (but there is no particular need for this), then in Thailand it is easy, you don’t even need to go to Nakhon Ratchasima: just cross the road in Patong and climb through the field - and now you are already in the area, where expats live in condos, prices magically drop, no one offers to ride a tuktuk or buy a three-piece suit, and it’s generally a nice place to be.

<b>Results</b>
Monthly expenses:
<img alt="" src="images/guide-thailand-49028_original.png" title=""/>
All the money was spent on durians and other goodies. Average $25 per day.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-thailand-48759_original.png" title=""/>
There are still a lot of places left in Thailand: at least Pattaya, Udon Thani, Chiang Mai, the Golden Triangle, Sukhothai, Koh Samui (and Full moon party on neighboring Phangan), Pattani and the far south. So see you soon, Thailand!
