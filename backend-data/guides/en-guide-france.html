As part of the nostalgic tours of the good old Europe, I definitely had to stop by France in the end. I've been to France 9 times, and also did three more trips to overseas territories, but I felt it wasn't enough, since I visited many regions very little, literally one city or one day at a time.

<b>Transport</b>
Transport in France is a problem (by European standards, of course). Traveling here is not as easy and relaxed as in Germany, Italy or Spain. The problem in France is that transport is rare. While in Germany there is a train between neighboring cities every hour (usually at the same minutes) or more often, in France the normal situation is that trains run 3-4 times throughout the day, one of which will, of course, be at 6 am, the other sometime late in the evening, in general there’s not much choice. For the same reason, in France it is difficult to see many cities in one day, as in Germany, when you go somewhere and get off in every major city along the way.
There is no connection between some cities at all, for example, try building a route from Limoges to Clermont-Ferrand, these are neighboring cities, less than 200 km apart. The train ride takes 5-6 hours with two transfers, and by bus it offers a route via Paris. Therefore, these two regions of Nomadmania remained unvisited by me. There is also the Franche-Comté region, I didn’t go from Dijon to Besançon in 2019, and there are no other transport lines in this region.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946304969_ca11489687_h.jpg"/>
Also, trains are quite expensive, and unlike other countries with expensive transport (UK, Switzerland, Denmark), there is not always even a theoretical opportunity to save. Let's look at trains and tariffs in more detail.
<i>TER</i> - the slowest trains, similar to German and Italian regional ones. They travel short distances between neighboring cities. There are no seat reservations. The price is almost 20 euros per hour, very expensive. Sometimes, when purchasing in advance, you can get a promotional rate, then the ticket costs a fixed small amount of 5 euros. But it seems that such fares are only available on routes where there are a lot of trains. For example, trains run from Metz to Nancy at least once an hour, and some will cost 5 euros even a couple of days before departure. And from Brest to Quimper, or from Quimper to Nantes, I don’t see any promotional tariffs at all. Experimentally, I found out that these promotional tariffs are only available for trains in the next month. If you look at dates that are more than a month away, there are no promotional rates, although the regular price is a couple of euros less than during the last month. For example, the same Metz-Nancy without a promotional tariff costs 16 euros, a month or more in advance - 14 euros.
<i>INTERCITÉS</i> - slightly longer distance trains. On some of them, seat reservation is compulsory. The price is more dynamic. Before the trip it is about the same as on TER, but in advance it can be half the price. There are not very many trains of this class (<a href="https://www.sncf-voyageurs.com/en/travel-with-us/in-france/intercites/our-destinations/">map</a>) , essentially this is where there is no high-speed line: from Paris to the south through the middle of the country, from Nantes along the coast to the south, and from east to west: from Nantes to Lyon in the middle and from Bordeaux to Marseille in the south.
Example: La Rochelle - Bordeaux (2 hours) costs from 19 to 35 euros, TER in the same direction costs 36-39 euros.
<i>TGV InOui</i> - high-speed trains. In France, as in Germany, they form the basis of long-distance transport. In France, they even banned internal flights between some cities for the sake of trains (for example, there is no flight from Bordeaux to Paris, but there is one to Lille, which is further to the north). Here the price is really dynamic, and it turns out much cheaper in advance, and cheaper than on a regional train.
<i>OuiGo</i> - low-cost high-speed trains. This is French know-how - essentially the same TGV, but there are some restrictions on luggage (compared to low-cost airlines - very generous). Tickets can be even cheaper than on the TGV, for example, I got from Bordeaux to Paris (this is halfway across the country) for only 25 euros, cheaper than from Bordeaux to a neighboring large city on the TER.

<i>All my travels in France. Red = trains, blue = buses, black = car</i>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946426340_abc076b38c_b.jpg"/>

Paris - Marseille (3-3.5 hours)
TGV:
1 day before: 118-131 euros.
5 days before: from 65 euros (but only in the evening, in the morning it’s still 130)
A month before: from 50 euros to 130, there are cheap options both morning and evening
4 months before: 40-60 euros for almost all departures
Ouigo: From 19 to 80 euros. Price ~25 euros or lower available for departure after 10 days, closer dates are more expensive.
Bus: 20-30 euros, mostly at night (since the ride takes 10 hours)

Bordeaux - Angouleme (less than an hour)
TGV:
1 day before: 27-39 euros
A week before: 22-40 euros
A month before: from 15 euros
Ouigo: 10-19 euros, a week before the 10 euro price is already available.
TER: 29 euros, 12 with discount
Bus: 10-17 euros, but only once a day

There are also intercity buses in France. They appeared around the same time as in Germany (around 2015). Now there are two main companies: Flixbus and Blablacar bus. Blablacar in 2019 was called Ouibus, and then you could buy tickets from 1 euro. Nowadays there seems to be no such freebie, but in general, buses are, of course, significantly cheaper than trains. But there are relatively few directions, mostly routes from Paris to somewhere. So if the two cities you want to travel between are on the same line as Paris (for example, Rennes - Brest), then there will be buses there.
Ride-sharing, also known as blablacar, is also very popular in France. Actually, France is the birthplace of this service; I still remember it under the name covoiturage.fr in 2012. It is not surprising that it appeared in this country, since there is a lack of frequency of public transport and high prices. Blablacar is much cheaper than trains, somewhere on par with buses. If you don't have a very busy schedule, then this is a good way to travel.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946229553_b05e752c50_h.jpg"/>
In France, for some reason, there are no  luggage lockers at train stations. But now the Nannybag service has appeared, where you can find a place to store your luggage, and it is available in all sizable cities. Basically, it's mostly hotels that already have a place to store the luggage of departing guests, and now they can earn a little extra money from outsiders.

Urban transport in France is well developed, as usual in Europe. There are six metro systems: Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Lille, Toulouse and Rennes (the latter was for a long time the smallest city in the world with a metro), and there are trams in almost every sizable city. Payment is usually per trip (not by zone, as in Germany). In Paris, for example, a metro ticket now costs 2.15, and 10 tickets cost 17.35, an all-day ticket costs 8.65. In Bordeaux, one trip costs 1.40, and a day ticket costs 5 euros.

<b>Accomodation</b>
France is probably the most non-hotel country in Europe. Whether in 2019 or 2024, I lived almost all the time in apartments or rooms rented on AirBnB, because it’s just significantly cheaper. In 2024 I paid no more than 40-50 euros per day, half of the places also were entire apartments, and always in the very center. Meanwhile, you can’t find a hotel for 50 euros in many cities, especially in the center.
<i>Apartment in Brest</i>

<b>Food</b>
France is famous for its cuisine. Let's figure out what it is.
Like <a href="https://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/739759.html">Italian</a>, French food is something “default” for Europe. I didn't know about many of the dishes that they were actually French. For example, steak with pepper sauce (<i>Steak au poivre</i>), steak with fries (<i>Steak frites</i>, although it can be Belgian) or onion soup (<i>Soupe à l'oignon</i>). Not to mention desserts - it seems that most of our usual desserts come from France, many have French names in English and Russian (eclair, mousse, profiterole, creme caramel, creme brulee, soufflé, brioche...)
Restaurants in France are expensive, more expensive than in Italy, not to mention Spain. The average price of a dish here is closer to 20 euros. Here is a typical menu for a completely unassuming restaurant with plastic chairs. Dishes cost 17 euros, there are more expensive ones for 22. Lunch menu is 23 euros.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945967186_c2b4d2562e_h.jpg"/>
Please note that the menu is quite short: 4 appetizers, 7 courses, 5 desserts - this is also quite typical for France; local restaurants prefer to specialize in a narrow range of dishes. Therefore, if you want to try something specific, finding it can be very difficult, like I wanted to try chicken in wine (coq au vin), in every city I tried to search through Google maps, tripadvisor, etc. restaurant websites, and found it only in one town, but the restaurant there opened too late (at 19-30, in France the opening hours of restaurants are similar to Italian ones, many have a very long break during the day), when I had to leave. In Paris, however, I immediately found several places with this dish, well, this is Paris, there are many restaurants there. But I tried a similar dish - beef stewed in wine (Bœuf Bourgignon - Burgundy beef).
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945967221_8d867800ca_h.jpg"/>
This restaurant in Bordeaux, by the way, is atypical in that the prices there are much lower than average. Here is the menu: dishes cost a maximum of 12 euros, and snacks generally cost 4-6.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946426300_af0c34bd52_h.jpg"/>
Such restaurants are the top spot, but there are few of them, and there are a lot of people there. Sometimes they are called bouillon (they once served broths there), including this one near Bordeaux station. In Paris there is Bouillon Chartier - prices there are also at about this level, a rare relatively budget friendly place in Paris. Here is a classic French dish from there - roast duck (confit de canard).
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945967196_7d6886d9c6_h.jpg"/>
There are a lot of visitors. Some restaurants are called Brasserie and Bistrot (this is from the Russian word “fast”), it is believed that “restaurant” is something more pretentious, but to be honest, I didn’t notice any fundamental difference. Well, probably super expensive Michelin-starred establishments are all restaurants, not brasseries, but for mid-level establishments these names are interchangeable.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946229593_515db7572a_h.jpg"/>
Here is a more extensive menu, there are several dishes of each category (meat, fish, seafood, salads...).
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945967216_bc1d7edd08_h.jpg"/>
Tartare, by the way, is a great thing - rarely found outside of France, so it's worth a try.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946426260_06e2d978c8_h.jpg"/>

Also in France they eat all sorts of unusual animals, for example, snails (escargots) are a popular snack.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946229633_9be0352232_h.jpg"/>
Oysters are also quite a rare occurrence in other countries; in general, as it turned out, all my life I confused them with scallops. In a restaurant, 6 oysters cost around 12 euros; it’s cheaper to get them at the food market, which is located in the center of every city - they start at 5 euros per kilogram, large ones for about 10. In the markets there is usually a place to sit down and eat oysters.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945067252_7c98b43622_h.jpg"/>
I didn’t see frogs for sale anywhere, although I wasn’t too upset, since I had already tried a frog in <a href="https://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/361384.html">Vietnam</a>. But I did try another infamous dish - foie gras (liver of a fat, well-fed goose). Although I really don’t like liver, I can eat foie gras, although it is of course expensive (more than 10 euros per piece).
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945067237_5a76239014_h.jpg"/>
When talking about French food, one cannot fail to mention what is sold in stores. If Spain is famous for its sausages and ham, then France is famous for its cheeses. Everyone's favorite Brie and Camembert cheeses come from here. They are inexpensive; brie is still less than 1.50 euros in any grocery store.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945067242_8aa78e2ae9_h.jpg"/>
But there are actually much more cheeses than what is sold everywhere in Europe. In France itself, the choice even in a small store is much wider. Some of them are quite similar, such as Coulommiers, which is similar to Camembert. But there are also completely different ones. For example, I can recommend Saint Felicien cheese - it has a very original taste. Reblochon from Savoie costs about the same as brie, but is more delicate. There is also Swiss-Savoy cheese Raclette - it is melted like fondue, but you can make sandwiches with it or put it on steaks.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945067402_bbc3f3995b_h.jpg"/>
<b>What to see</b>
The European part of France consists of 13 regions (in 2016, a reform took place that united 22 old regions into 13 current ones). France also has 13 overseas territories, which when counting countries are usually considered separate countries (even if not independent). They actually have different statuses:
- Five overseas regions are considered part of France, they have the same laws, and they are taken into account in statistics on an equal basis with metropolitan France. This is <a href="https://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/53177.html">Martinique</a>, <a href="https://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a> (in the Caribbean), Reunion, Mayotte (in the Indian Ocean near Madagascar) and French Guiana (in South America north of Brazil)
- Five overseas communities have a certain autonomy: <a href="https://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/738610.html">Saint Martin</a>, Saint Barthelemy (in the Caribbean), Saint Pierre and Miquelon (off the eastern coast of Canada), Wallis and Futuna, <a href="https://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/french%20polynesia">French Polynesia</a> (in Oceania)
- <a href="https://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/184588.html">New Caledonia</a> has an even more autonomous status and is fighting for independence.
- Finally, the two “countries” do not have permanent populations. These are the French Southern and Antarctic Territories (islands in the southern Indian Ocean) and Clipperton (an island in the Pacific Ocean near Mexico)

<b>Île-de-France</b> - Paris and its suburbs.
The capital of France, of course, needs no introduction.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946229708_8d1109823d_h.jpg"/>
The borders of Paris are quite narrow; you can cross the city on foot in a few hours, and then the suburbs begin. I have been to many: La Défense (suburb with skyscrapers), Saint-Denis (tomb of kings, stadium and many migrants), Vincennes (castle), Montreuil, Lilas, Neuilly (residential areas), Marne-la-Vallée (Disneyland) .
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946305104_039010ff67_h.jpg"/>
Of the distant suburbs, I have only been to Versailles a long time ago, but I have not been to Fontainebleau and Provins (also World Heritage Sites).
<b>Hauts-de-France</b> - north of Paris, a region heavily damaged by the First World War. I have not been to the capital, Lille.

There are still many interesting places in Normandy: Le Havre, Cherbourg, Etretat, Honfleur...
<b>Brittany</b> - northwestern corner. The Breton language is preserved here - the only Celtic language on the mainland, although it is now being replaced by French.
Rennes is the capital. From here it is convenient to get to Mont Saint-Michel, otherwise the city is not particularly outstanding.

You can definitely travel a lot around this region: Avignon, Toulon, Aix-en-Provence, Arles, Grasse, Verdon Gorge...

<b>Corsica</b> is an island in the Mediterranean Sea, the only region where I have not been. For some reason, almost nothing flies there, only Air France from Paris at a ridiculous price, and rarely from any other cities. Despite the fact that there are 100500 flights to neighboring Sardinia from different European countries.
