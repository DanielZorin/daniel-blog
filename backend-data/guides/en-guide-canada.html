Last year I visited North America for the fourth time, this time including the second largest country in the world, Canada. Although I have only been to the main cities and have not seen the outback of Canada, I can give a brief overview of this country.

<b>Visa</b>
A visa to Canada for Russian citizens is currently the second most difficult after Australia. If we discard countries where it is difficult to obtain a visa because of their closed nature, and not because of fear of illegal migration (such as Saudi Arabia), then complexity can be defined as a completely objective indicator of the percentage of refusals - about 25% for Canada. For comparison, in Australia it is 40%, in the USA - 11%, in the Schengen countries - 1-2%. The general idea is similar to the USA - you benefit from a large number of countries visited (confirmed by passport scans) and a large amount of money (confirmed by a certificate from work and bank statements). Tickets and hotel reservations are not needed, just give an approximate route. Canada seems to have a weird requirement that all documents translated into English must be notarized, but I didn't encounter this problem since everything I sent was originally in English. In addition to these documents, you need to fill out a standard form and send it all through the website. As I understand it, this is all being considered somewhere in Canada, so everything needs to be in English. The website indicates the waiting time, in my case it turned out to be absolutely accurate - exactly on the ninth working day I received a letter of approval. Canada, like the US, has an "administrative review" process, so some people are unlucky and wait several months to get their visa.
The visa fee is exactly 100 Canadian dollars (about 80 American).
After your visa is approved, you need to go to the visa center in Moscow in the industrial zone on Savelovskaya, hand in your passport, pay about 1,500 rubles for “postage,” and pick it up a few days later with the visa sticker in it. A visa is usually given until the expiration date of the passport, in particular, I now have almost 9 years to travel to Canada.
The border seemed pretty relaxed to me. There was almost no queue at the Montreal airport; you need to scan your passport and take a photo in a special machine, it loads your visa data. The border guard asked if I was bringing food with me. At the land borders they also let me through quite easily, but still asked a few questions - we can consider this to be part of the local culture of small talk.


<b>Currency</b>
The Canadian dollar (I will write CAD, and the $ sign will, as always, denote the American dollar) has currently fallen and is equal to 0.8 of the American dollar. There was a period when it was higher, then it was noticeably expensive in Canada, but now, give or take, it’s the same as in the USA in many respects.
I only saw bills of 5, 10, 20 dollars, although there are also 50 and 100. 1 and 2 dollars, unlike America, are only coins. 1 cent coins are not in use; prices are rounded up to 5 cents everywhere.
ATMs charge a withdrawal fee of 2-4 dollars.

<b>Accomodation</b>
Accomodation in Canada, in my experience, turned out to be much cheaper than in the USA (and this, whatever one may say, is the main expense when traveling to these countries). In Montreal, I rented an airbnb for only 20 dollars very close to the center (Plateau district), and this was far from the only offer with a similar price. In Toronto it was a little more expensive and was far from the center; I had to take the subway for about 30 minutes, and then 20 minutes on foot or several stops by bus. In Ottawa I stayed in a hostel because it was for one night, but there are also many options there. In Niagara Falls, accommodations are tight, especially on weekends, so you need to book early. In Vancouver, I lived in a hostel because I needed it right in the center due to logistics, but there are also options on airbnb there for about $25-30. Hostels, by the way, are also cheaper than American ones: in the very center of Vancouver it cost 30 CAD = 24 USD, in neighboring Seattle I had to pay almost twice as much, and they say that Vancouver is expensive.
Even ordinary hotels and motels in Canada are much cheaper: I saw private rooms in Toronto from 50 Canadian dollars, in the USA in big cities it is 1.5-2 times more expensive.

<b>Transport</b>
I was in the most populated parts of the country, so I had no problems with public transport. In general, Canada is a large country, most of it is sparsely populated, and you can only get around there by car, and in the far north only by plane.
Flights within Canada are not particularly cheap and are usually more expensive than flights of similar distances south of the border. There are no low-cost airlines. But, of course, for traveling long distances, flights are much better than land transport. It's possible to build a route consisting of several flights like Toronto-Winnipeg-Calgary-Vancouver at a decent price.
In principle, there are trains across the entire country from the Pacific to the Atlantic, but they are expensive. As a result, I have never traveled by train, although I have been to all the main stations (except Ottawa), which look traditionally monumental. Intercity trains also have a cool shape:
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946230593_2689e81d6f_h.jpg"/>
Trains cost one and a half to two times more than buses, and tickets for them also need to be purchased in advance via the Internet, otherwise you will overpay twice as much.
Intercity buses run regularly between the main cities; outside the Quebec - Niagara Falls section there are much fewer of them. In the Atlantic provinces there is a decent network, but west of Toronto there is little transport, the distances there are too long. There are regular buses from Vancouver across the border to Seattle. I rode mostly Greyhound buses. In Quebec they serve only Montreal, further to Quebec City there are "Orleans Express" buses. There is also the familiar Megabus with cheap sale tickets, but their route from Montreal to Toronto goes past Ottawa, which did not suit me, and for Niagara Falls their price was the same as Greyhound.
Approximate prices for comparison. Montreal-Quebec by bus costs about 27 CAD one way, the ride is three hours (250 km). A train in the same direction at the ticket office costs more than 100 CAD, on the Internet if in advance, then about 35 CAD (a month before) or 57 CAD (a week before). In general, the price for the bus is normal, about the same as the prices for travel in Italy or Spain.
On Greyhound I paid the following prices: Montreal-Ottawa 27 CAD, Ottawa-Toronto 46 CAD, Toronto-Niagara Falls 16 CAD, Seattle-Vancouver round trip 41 USD.

In cities, travel by public transport usually costs around 3-3.50 CAD, that is, quite expensive. But there are life-saving day passes. In Montreal, I paid 10 CAD for 24 hours, but this includes travel from the airport. The city-only pass is cheaper. In Toronto, a calendar day ticket costs 12.50 CAD. In Vancouver it's 10 CAD. These three cities have normal metro systems with several lines, so you can travel easily. In Quebec there are only buses, I bought two single tickets for 3 CAD to go to the waterfalls, but in principle there is a ticket for the day there too. In Ottawa, the most expensive bus fare is 3.50 CAD. In all of the above cities, using public transport is quite convenient, even buses are quite usable. For example, in Toronto, in the area where I lived, which consisted mostly of one-story private houses, buses ran every 15 minutes until late in the evening.

<b>Food</b>
Canadian specialties are poutine sauce and maple syrup. Poutine is a sauce for French fries, it is served even at any McDonald's, you can also buy it in the store.
I was under the impression that major cities in Canada have more supermarkets within walking distance than in the US, at least I didn't have to take the subway to the other side of town to buy food. The assortment in supermarkets is quite good, it’s probably worth making a separate review post about this. Prices are much higher than in Russia, plus there are practically no promotions or sales (at best they will knock off 20 percent).
For example, the food in the photo cost a total of 22 Canadian dollars. At the same time, meat is not expensive, about the same as in Russia, but for example eggs cost 3 dollars (here they are sold in packs of 12 pieces). And a can of ice cream cost the same amount, I couldn’t resist buying it. And I took the cheapest pasta for 2 dollars 500 grams.

As for restaurants, I almost didn’t go to them, instead using my full cooking skill, which in North America saves a lot of money. Eating at McDonald's is not particularly cheap, 8-9 CAD per menu.
The only restaurant I went to was a Japanese buffet in Vancouver (called Shabusen). For 17 CAD there you can get an unlimited amount of sushi during the day, which I took advantage of to eat properly.

<b>Internet</b>
Internet in Canada is expensive, even travel guides recommend buying a SIM card in the USA if you are coming from the south. One gigabyte costs from $30. I used the SIM card DreamSim - it has per-megabyte tariffication, one gigabyte in Canada costs 35 euros, so I didn’t waste much traffic.

<b>What to see</b>
Canada, like Russia, is large but sparsely populated, and most of the territory is in the far north, where there are almost no roads. This country is a more humane place to live than America - just like in Europe, there is universal free healthcare and a lot of social services. In general, the infrastructure is much closer to the Europe we are used to, especially in French-speaking Quebec. There is also a more loyal immigration policy here than in the United States, which is clearly visible in the population of Toronto and Vancouver.

Let's take a quick look at the regions:
<b>Quebec</b> is a region where French is spoken. I flew here to the large interesting city of Montreal, with the old center and skyscrapers.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946306024_2c51281716_h.jpg"/>
Also interesting is the old capital city of Quebec - probably, of all the cities north of Mexico, it most closely resembles a European medieval town. In addition, Quebec extends quite far to the north.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946230603_f0ea534013_h.jpg"/>
<b>Atlantic Provinces</b> - three small states east of Quebec, and not far from there is the island of Newfoundland. Probably, if I come to Canada again and go by car to these parts, there should be many beautiful Nordic landscapes, like on the other side of the Atlantic in Ireland and Scandinavia.
<b>Ontario</b>. Here is the largest city of Toronto - a typical North American metropolis with skyscrapers and the private houses.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945968146_7360e9a969_h.jpg"/>
And also the capital of the country, Ottawa, is right on the border with Quebec.

A couple of hours drive from Toronto on the American border are Niagara Falls - by a huge margin the most visited place by tourists in Canada, where for many tourists Canada ends.

<b>Prairies</b> - western Ontario and beyond Manitoba, Saskatchewan. The region is not rich in attractions, like the American states south of the border in these places.
<b>Alberta</b> - here the prairies end and the Rocky Mountains begin, you can visit two of the most famous national parks in Canada - Banff and Jasper. A car is highly desirable.
<b>British Columbia</b> is a mountainous region on the Pacific coast. There is the large city of Vancouver, as well as ski resorts where prices are so fierce that the resorts of Switzerland will seem cheap to you.

<b>The Far North</b> - three huge provinces where there are almost no people and roads. You can drive to the Yukon on your way to Alaska, but the Arctic islands can only be reached by plane.

<b>Resume</b>

Overall the trip was not cheap. For ~25 days in Iceland, Canada and the USA, I spent about $2,700, of which more than 60% was transport: flights, buses, and another 30% was accomodation (on average only $30 per day, by the standards of the continent, it's cheap - about the same as in Western Europe). The cost of food was ridiculously low due to the fact that I was cooking - $5 a day was enough for a constant diet of good meat. Of the $60 in restaurant expenses, half is two sushi dinners in Vancouver.
If we highlight Canada separately, then this is what expenses look like for 7 days in the eastern part of the country (two days in Vancouver are not taken into account):
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945968206_5f8b9848d1_c.jpg"/>
Quite representatively - more than half for travel (buses only), 30% for housing.
