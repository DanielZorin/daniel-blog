Iraq is a country that was opened to tourism just two years ago. Before that, almost no one had been there for 40 years due to the Iran-Iraq War, the Gulf war, the sanctions, the U.S. invasion of 2003, eight years of occupation with almost daily terrorist attacks, and the war against ISIS. The rare adventurers who managed to enter also didn't travel much around the country because it was dangerous and it was not allowed to visit many places. But all that changed in 2021. Now anyone can fly to Baghdad and backpack throughout most of the country, there is no war or terrorist attacks. There is very little information though, for example, on Wikivoyage the articles are still pre-war. For preparation, I mainly used <a href="https://www.theglobetrottingdetective.com/traveling-to-iraq-travel-guide">this article</a> by a girl from Hungary who has visited Iraq several times already . But everything is changing so quickly that some things there have already become outdated.

<b>Basics</b>
The currency of Iraq is called the dinar. Official rate is $1 = 1300 dinars, the unofficial rate $1 = 1600 dinars. I didn’t know about the black market rate, I haven’t seen any mention of it anywhere in blogs or guidebooks, apparently it only appeared this year. In the exchange offices where I saw the rate displayed on the board, it was ~1300. How surprised I was when I found a money changers at the market in Najaf, and they gave me dinars at the rate of 1600! Below, I will convert the prices into dollars at the rate of 1600, although in fact I exchanged more than hald of my money at 1300, that is, I lost several dozens of dollars because of this.
Denominations are a bit unusual: 250, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000 and 25000 dinars.

Power sockets in Iraq are either British type or universal.
Internet: I bought a SIM from the first provider I found, Asia Cell. I paid 1,500 dinars for the SIM card + 15,000 for 10 gigabytes of Internet. For 25,000 you can buy 20 GB. It's funny that there is no article about Iraq on the <a href="https://prepaid-data-sim-card.fandom.com/wiki/Iraq">prepaid-data-sim-card wiki</a>, although there is an article about almost any country of Africa and Oceania
The language spoken in Iraq is Arabic. English proficiency is probably the lowest of any Arab country I've been to, which was a bit surprising given the 8 years of American occupation. One needs to practice Arabic.

<b>Visa</b>
A visa can be obtained upon arrival at the airports of Baghdad and Basra; there is also information that a visa is also issued at the land borders with Jordan, Kuwait and Iran. The borders with Syria and Saudi Arabia are probably closed. The border with Turkey is open, but it seems like they don’t give a full-fledged visa there, as well as when arriving at Erbil airport. This strange situation is because Iraqi Kurdistan, which borders Turkey, has broad autonomy and even had a referendum on independence. Until 2021, when Iraq began issuing visa on arrival, most travelers went only to Kurdistan. Citizens of many countries are allowed into Kurdistan without a visa at all, free of charge; citizens of Russia need to obtain a visa online or upon arrival. But this visa is only valid in Kurdistan; it will not allow you to enter the rest of Iraq!
The visa officially costs $75, but they charged me $80 at the Baghdad airport. The registration process is organized quite chaotically, everyone is waiting, crowding around, then hand over the passports and forms to one border guard, he leaves for half an hour to process them somewhere.

<b>Accomodation</b>
Hotels in Iraq are quite cheap. You need to look for them locally, since there are very few on Booking.com, mainly in Baghdad and Erbil, and not the cheapest ones. Most hotels cost 20-30 thousand dinars ($12-18). The cheapest was in Karbala for only 10,000! In general, there are a lot of hotels in Karbala and Najaf, as pilgrims come there. There are few hotels in other cities; it is better to figure out in advance which one you will go to stay in.
The most expensive hotel was in Baghdad - 40,000 dinars.

<b>Food</b>
There are practically no restaurants with menus in Iraq. I only came across one at the very end in Mosul. As a rule, establishments either have no menu at all, or a list of dishes hangs on the wall at the entrance (in Arabic, of course). There is a cashier sitting at the entrance, whom you pay to at the end (the waiter will put a bill on your table). In such places you order a main course, and they bring you bread, snacks and water for free. Just like in Turkey, though the snacks are different.
In the evenings, kebab shops start operating. The skewers lie on a mobile cart, and there are usually plastic chairs and tables around, right on the sidewalk. A skewer of beef BBQ costs only 3,000 dinars (less than $2). A small piece of kebab costs the same (usually they bring two of them for 6,000, the total volume is larger than a standard Turkish kebab).

Appetizers here include vinaigrette, hummus and sauerkraut.

Menu of an expensive restaurant (only in Arabic). Here dishes cost 20-25 thousand, like in Europe. I took the “Mosul style” dish, it turned out to be very tasty meat, although a little greasy.

Supermarkets are also a rarity. You will encounter mostly small shops.
A bottle of cola of unusual volume 0.75 costs 750 dinars. A Bounty or Mars chocolate bar costs the same. I don’t know how much water costs; it’s always given out for free somewhere.

<b>Transport</b>
The main transport in Iraq is shared taxi. They are either ordinary yellow cars that drive around the city (fit four people). Large cars with 10 seats are less common. They say there are full-fledged buses too, but I haven’t seen them at bus stations. In terms of price, naturally, the more seats in a vehicle, the cheaper.
Collective taxis depart from places called "garages" in Arabic. If you say "Baghdad Garage", local taxi drivers will know where to go. In the "garages" everything is quite chaotic, but I never waited long. Although I mostly took four-seater taxis (not on purpose, they just seem to depart more often).

As I understand, the front seat near the driver costs a little more. I also suspect that sometimes they charged me more than they should, so I can’t guarantee that you will pay the same amount, but a rough guide is below:
Baghdad to Samarra 15000
Baghdad to Hillah 10000 (4 seats) / 6000 (10 seats)
Baghdad to Basra 25000 (sleeper train)
Basra to Nasiriyah 10000
Nasiriyah to Najaf 20000
Najaf to Karbala 8000
Karbala to Baghdad 15000
Baghdad to Kirkuk 30000
Kirkuk to Mosul 25000 / 20000
Mosul to Erbil 6000 (minibus)

There are also passenger trains in Iraq. There is a night train from Baghdad to Basra, which departs seemingly three times a week (Sat, Sun, Mon) at 7 pm. It arrives in Basra around 4 am, not very convenient. But it’s cheap: a ticket for a four-person sleeper compartment costs 25,000, and I was traveling alone in the compartment. There are more expensive two-person compartments for 35,000, as well as seats that are much cheaper (there are also two classes, the most expensive is 10,000). The ticket can only be bought in person at the station on the day of departure; they did not sell it to me in advance.
There are also commuter trains from Baghdad to Fallujah and Karbala.

There are police checkpoints on the roads in Iraq. When Iraq first opened in 2021, unaccompanied tourists were not allowed into some cities. Now this problem has almost disappeared, with the exception of Samarra. As a rule, a checkpoint is a roadblock where a military man stands and checks documents. Sometimes he waves to the driver and we pass. Sometimes they want to look at the documents (although they may let the locals through without scrutiny). Then you give your passport, they look at your photo and visa. In half the cases, they ask you to get out of the car and take you aside to a house where the local head officer sits. He takes a photo of the passport and visa with his phone and wishes you a safe journey. I was asked a couple of times which hotel I was planning to stay at.
The only city where tourists are still not allowed to move around on their own is Samarra. Previously, they took your passport at the entrance and returned it when leaving. They didn’t take my passport, but at the entrance to the city the military put me together with a taxi driver who was planning to go to Baghdad. I also haggled and brought the price down from 50 to 30 thousand. The taxi driver took me to the Malwiya mosque, which turned out to be closed. He did not agree to take me to the Al-Askari mosque, although I even offered to pay more. Perhaps there really are some restrictions on entry.
There are many more checkpoints north of Baghdad than in the south. In the south they usually check only when entering some city, but in the north there are checkpoints along the way. A funny thing happened to me between Kirkuk and Mosul. At the first checkpoint, 10 km from Kirkuk, our ten-seater taxi was stopped. They questioned me in detail, looked at my photos on Instagram, after that several men with machine guns drove up and escorted our taxi to the nearest military base. There we were taken to the biggest boss, so important that everyone stood up in his presence. In the process, I realized that the main problem was not with me, but with another passenger - he was interrogated for a long time about something, while they only asked me a couple of routine questions. It turned out that the man had a gun with him, and something was wrong with the documents. As a result, we stayed in this military base for two hours. All the passengers in our taxi left, except for the man with the gun, because they were released almost immediately, however my passport remained on the big boss’s desk all this time. As a result, the taxi driver called his friends, and the two of us were put into another four-seater taxi. While they were waiting for him, the driver also bought the ill-fated gun for $200 (or agreed to keep it temporarily, I didn’t understand this from the dialogue). In a four-seater taxi we drove towards Mosul, but later the driver said that it was impossible to go directly to Mosul (I didn’t understand why), and dropped me off at the turn to Erbil. Because of this, I had to spend money on a taxi to the Erbil bus station, and wasted a lot of time: the whole journey took 8 hours instead of 2.

I traveled around the cities only by taxi. Public transport is theoretically available, but it’s almost impossible to figure it out; buses and minibuses don’t even seem to have numbers. The Careem app is available in Baghdad, Basra, Erbil and Najaf. There is also a local application called Baly, I tried to use it, but three drivers out of three did not know where to go, they tried to call me on the phone, in the end I gave up and only used Careem. An average trip around the city usually costs 5,000 dinars. Long ones cost closer to 10,000. The minimum price was 3,000. This is not particularly cheap, especially considering that gasoline is very cheap in Iraq (450 dinars per liter = $0.30). By the way, in Kurdistan gasoline is twice as expensive as in the rest of Iraq, but taxi in Erbil costs the same as in other cities.

<b>Where to go</b>
<b>Baghdad</b> is the capital, a very large city. There is a small old city area that is now being actively restored for tourism. Two Shia imams (7th and 9th) are buried in the Al-Kadhimiya mosque in the north of the city. The part of the city where the government is located (the "Green Zone") is closed to access, although it's possible to drive on the main streets by taxi.

<b>Samarra</b> is the home to the famous Malwiya spiral mosque, a World Heritage Site. They didn’t let me into the mosque because it was under restoration (but they didn’t charge the 25,000 entry fee either). Samarra also has the Al-Askari Mosque, where two more imams (10th and 11th) are buried, which is why many pilgrims come there and the mosque is heavily guarded. I couldn't get there.

<b>Babylon</b> is the most famous archaeological site in Iraq (entrance 25,000 dinars). Located near the town of Hillah. During the time of Saddam Hussein, a full-fledged wall was built over the remains of the foundation, and Saddam’s palace was constructed on a hill nearby, which is why this place looks very different from the ruins of other ancient citie.

<b>Najaf</b> is the holy city of the Shia, where Imam Ali (the first imam and fourth caliph) is buried. In the neighboring city of Kufa one can visit the site of Ali's death.

<b>Karbala</b> is the second holy city, where Imam Hussein, the most revered among the Shia, is buried.

<b>Nasiriyah</b> - next to this city there are the ruins of the ancient city of Ur with a huge ziggurat (entrance 25,000). Recently free access has been allowed; previously this city was difficult to enter.

<b>Basra</b> is a major port in the south. The only city in Iraq where some historical houses remain.

<b>Kirkuk</b> is the center of oil production. In the center there is an empty fortress where no one is allowed inside. In this city, most residents speak a dialect of Turkish (Turkmenli).

<b>Mosul</b> is a very interesting city. It had a vast historical center with ancient mosques and churches. Mosul was the capital of ISIS in Iraq from 2014 to 2017, and a nine-month battle in 2017 destroyed much of the city, although many areas remained partially intact and are being restored. The ruins of the ancient city of Nineveh, the capital of Assyria, are also in Mosul, but little has survived from them.

<b>Erbil</b> is the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan. The citadel is listed as a World Heritage Site, but is currently undergoing renovations and is closed to entry.

<b>Conclusion</b>
I spent $725 in 10 days. The expenses could have been lower, around $600, if I had changed all the money at the black market rate, and without an unsuccessful trip from Kirkuk to Mosul. Most of the money was spent on getting around; food and housing cost pennies. In general, the country is fascinating and very much worth a visit if you are interested in the Middle East and the Islamic world.
