I expected the worst from Nepal. One of the poorest countries in Asia, much lower even than India in terms of development, ten years of civil war, and also destroyed two years ago by an earthquake. What good could there be here besides Everest and other mountains?

However...

<b>Visa</b>
15 days = $25, 30 days = $40, 90 days = $100. Can be renewed for $2 per day, but not more than 150 days in total per calendar year. A visa can be obtained upon arrival and at land borders (not at all, but at the main ones you can).

<b>Money</b>
$1 = 100 Nepalese rupees. All ATMs charge a fee of 400-500 rupees. Many ATMs have low limits, but you can find ones with a normal limit of 35 thousand rupees = $350.

<b>Language</b>
Nepali is written in the same letters as Hindi. It is unlikely that you will wander into non-tourist areas in Nepal, so English is sufficient. Tourism in Nepal is well developed.

<b>Accomodation</b>
Cheap, fortunately the climate is cool, and you can live without air conditioning. In Pokhara I paid 500 rupees per day, in Kathmandu - 700 (but with hot water and normal Internet), you can find cheaper ones if you need.
On the trek, accommodation costs from 0 to 500 rupees, provided that you eat there, otherwise around 1000.

<b>Food</b>
After India, it’s just like Europe! In some small village there is more choice of snacks than in an Indian supermarket. In Kathmandu and Pokhara you can eat steaks inexpensively. The tourist restaurants near the embankment in Pokhara are surprisingly expensive - the prices are not at all Asian, but if you go further inland, everything is fine.

The price is indicated on the packaging of goods, as in India, but here it is very often not observed, especially in roadside shops on the highways.
The supermarket in Kathmandu is not bad:

They even have panty liners, which are almost impossible to find in India even in the largest cities.

I should also say something about food on the treks. Prices in trekking areas are fixed by a local cartel, they are several times higher than in ordinary cities, and the higher the altitude, the more expensive. Here is an example of a price tag:

To save money, it is wise to take one high-calorie dish (chicken noodles, for example) and tea. For the two of us, it came out to $12-15 a day for food. Water there also costs a lot, almost a dollar per liter (in the city 20-25 cents), but I drank free water from pumps and springs everywhere on the track, and had no problems because of it. This is still not Varanasi, where the dirtiest river in the world flows, here the water flows from the peaks of the Himalayas in the form of mountain streams, it should not be infectious.
But you shouldn’t drink tap water in Kathmandu - it’s probably the muddiest water I’ve ever seen. Even in Bangladesh the water is much cleaner.

<b>Transport</b>
The roads in Nepal are bad, the earthquake destroyed them even more, but I expected the worst. I came across only one completely rundown area, on the way from the Indian border to Pokhara. From Pokhara to Kathmandu the road is more or less fine.
The fare is low. Both long journeys Birganj-Pokhara and Pokhara-Kathmandu cost me 500 rupees each (distance about 250 kilometers). Come to the bus station yourself and take the bus; they go from Pokhara to Kathmandu every 10 minutes, and the travel agency will charge from 10 to 25 dollars. I was traveling on a regular bus without tourists, but it was very nice there - no chickens, goats, a lot of free seats, ventilation, soft chairs.
You can travel around the city in Kathmandu and Pokhara by buses that run along the main roads. The fare depends on the distance, somewhere between 15 and 30 rupees. The easiest way to travel around Kathmandu is along the ring road; from Thamel it takes about 15 minutes to walk to it; along the road there is a monkey temple, Boudha stupa, cremation temple, and the center of Patan.

<b>Internet</b>
There are only two providers in Nepal. I used NCell, I bought a SIM card from their office in Birganj. For 300 rupees I got a SIM card and 1200 megabytes of internet for a month - very cheap. To purchase, you need to fill out a form, give a 3x4 photo and leave your fingerprints. On the trek near Annapurna, the Internet did not work for me somewhere after 2000 meters of altitude, but there was Wi-fi in the hotels.

<b>Entertainment</b>
Nepal is pleasant enough that you can just hang out there, but still the main reason for traveling to this country is hiking (or trekking). Nepal is ideal for those who grew up in the city and do not have the skills to survive in the wild or simply do not want to live in a tent for two weeks. Along the entire route there are a lot of simple hotels, usually combined with restaurants. If you are tired, you can stop for the night. The cost of living is nominal, once it was even free. Popular treks go mostly through populated areas (you can physically live at an altitude of up to 4200 meters), and follow local roads and stone stairs in the mountains along which locals have always traveled.
There are two places in Nepal where the vast majority of tourists go: Annapurna and Everest. The rest of the regions are less known; entry into many is generally prohibited for foreigners. To get to Everest, you need to buy a plane ticket from Kathmandu to the village of Lukla, which costs $250-300 round trip (it takes a week to walk from the nearest highway to Lukla). You can get to Pokhara, next to which Annapurna is located, by bus for $5. The main tracks are:
Annapurna Circuit is the longest trek, about 20 days. The maximum height is over 5 kilometers. You can shorten the length to 8 days if you buy plane tickets to the village about 1/3 of the trek, and from the village at 2/3 of the trek, for $200 in total.
Everest Base Camp - 10-11 days, the last two are a walk back along the same road. The height is even higher than Annapurna - 5400 meters.
Annapurna Base Camp - 8 days trek, altitude no more than 4500.
I didn't have the time or equipment for such long treks, so I went on an easy trek in the Annapurna region with a maximum altitude of 3200 meters. Nevertheless, it turned out to be very cool: the landscapes along the way are magical, you can see panoramas of the mountains, the road is moderate in difficulty, similar to the roads in Chinese mountains like Taishan: many, many stone stairs.

To go hiking in the Annapurna region, you must first buy tickets and passes at a special office in Pokhara; in total it costs $40 per person - the most significant expense in Nepal. It seems that a significant part of tourists go through travel agencies that prepare all the documents themselves and also provide a guide, for which they charge 20-30 dollars a day. In reality, it’s not clear why you need a guide, it’s very difficult to get lost there, even if you don’t have a smartphone, you can take a paper map, there are few roads there. You can also hire a porter to avoid carrying a backpack, but this problem can be solved by leaving most of your things at your hotel in Pokhara for the duration of the trek.

<b>Results</b>
In 15 days I spent $454, exactly $30 per day. Of these, $50 for the visa and another $80 for the trek pass; if you subtract this, you get $21 a day, which sets a record for cheapness. Well, here, of course, cheap housing without air conditioning and a minimum number of intercity moves play a role. Another unique thing here is that the largest expense item, by far, is food.

Nepal is awesome. The country pleasantly surprised and exceeded expectations. Someday I need to come back and go to Everest.
