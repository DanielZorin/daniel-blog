Today I will tell you about Ireland - one of the European countries rarely visited by Russians. For a long time it was the last country of the Old World that I had not visited. I didn’t have any high expectations, but it turned out that this is a very beautiful country, the landscapes of which reminded me a little of <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/533372.html">New Zealand</a>.
On the island of Ireland, in addition to the Republic of Ireland, there is also Northern Ireland - part of the United Kingdom. Although this is a different country, I will also write about it, because the Irish themselves perceive the island as an integral territory, albeit divided between two states: on all maps and souvenirs, the outline of the country corresponds to the outline of the entire island, there is no continuous border between the parts, and Northern Irish athletes can play for either of the two countries.

<b>Visa</b>
Ireland is not going to leave the European Union, but it is not included in the Schengen zone. Theoretically, you can get an Irish visa in Moscow, but in practice, it seems, almost no one does this, except for those who need to go to Ireland for business - it’s much easier to get a visa to the UK, which also allows you to enter Ireland. Due to the almost zero number of Irish visa applicants, there is an abnormally high refusal rate (all normal tourists get a UK visa and the approval rate increases there).
It is required that the UK visa is open and the period of stay there has not expired. Since by default a 180-day stay is set upon entry, after that you can go back to Russia and then come to Ireland directly or through a third country until the 180 days are over (if you have a British visa not for six months, but longer, then you’ll probably have to first go to England, and then you can go to Ireland again).
The situation with borders is very interesting. There is a Common Travel Area (CTA) between the UK and Ireland. This means that British nationals can enter Ireland without passport control (as within Schengen), only needing to show a passport or other proof of citizenship. When entering Ireland there is always passport control at the airport or port, but only selective control at the land border with Northern Ireland. At the same time, there are no controls when entering the UK from Ireland, even planes arrive at the domestic terminal! It turns out that you can come to Ireland, and from there enter the UK without a visa and control (however, the scheme for Russians does not make sense, because a visa to Ireland is more difficult to obtain; but there are some countries that are visa-free to Ireland, but not visa-free to England).


<b>Accomodation</b>
Expensive. Of course, we must make allowances for the fact that I was there in August, this is the peak season. But still, in the UK there was more choice and lower prices. In Ireland I lived everywhere through Airbnb and it cost from 40 to 55 dollars a day, there were simply no cheaper options. In Dublin it was also quite far from the center. On Booking.com, everything was very bad, especially in Killarney, hotels started well over 100 euros, except for one hostel with 50 rooms, which is located 5 kilometers from the city.
In Northern Ireland, housing was also more expensive than in England.
As a result, accomodation costs accounted for more than half of all.

<b>Transport</b>
Ireland has both trains and buses.
The train network is good, covering all major cities. There are routes not only through Dublin. Travel usually costs more than by bus, and is generally not cheap. There are essentially no ways to save a lot: if you look at the official website, you can see that by buying in advance, you can save as much as 1-1.5 euros: if a Flexible Ticket costs 14 euros, then a Promo ticket costs 13. However, it will cost you to buy a ticket at the box office or from a machine another 2-3 euros more expensive than on the website, which is not at all obvious - usually if the ticket is Flexible, then this is the maximum price, but this is not the case in Ireland.
Buses go everywhere, between major cities usually at intervals of 1-2 hours at least. There is a main company, Bus Eireann, and several smaller companies serving limited routes from Dublin. Bus Eireann is almost the same price as trains, other companies may be cheaper, but there are no promotional tickets for 1 euro, as happens in some other countries. For example, from Dublin to Kilkenny, the cheaper Dublin Coach company will take you for exactly 10 euros, and not 17. It is also interesting that a round-trip ticket is significantly cheaper than two separate tickets, for example, Killarney-Limerick one way costs 15 euros, and back and forth 19.
In Ireland, for some reason, one-day excursions are very cheap, a trip around the Ring of Kerry for the whole day was only 23 euros (even just traveling this route by regular bus will cost twice as much). From Dublin you can go on an excursion all the way to Northern Ireland for only 55-60 euros. For the tour to the Cliffs of Moher I paid only 30 euros, despite the fact that entrance to the cliffs costs 8 euros, and entrance to the Ailwee Caves costs another 15.
Northern Ireland has its own transport company, combining local buses and trains. Unlike trains in the rest of the UK, prices in Northern Ireland are stable and there is no need to buy tickets too far in advance. There's also a network-wide all-day ticket for £17.50. A one-way ticket from Belfast to Londonderry costs £13, so it's a good deal for long journeys.
Travel prices:
Dublin - Kilkenny, bus, 10 euros
Kilkenny - Waterford, bus, 5 euros
Waterford - Cork, bus, 10 euros
Cork - Killarney, train, 21.30 euros
Tour of the Ring of Kerry, 23 euros
Killarney - Limerick, bus, 15 euros
Limerick - Galway, train, 10 euros (the only section where the train is for some reason much cheaper than the bus)
Excursion to the Cliffs of Moher, 30 euros
Galway - Sligo, bus, 17 euros
Sligo - Londonderry, bus, 21 euros
Londonderry - Giant's Causeway - Belfast, £17.50

<b>Food</b>
Food prices are above average for Western Europe, and higher than in the UK. Cheap supermarkets are Lidl and Tesco, the rest are more expensive and there are few promotions.
I liked the prices for meat: you can get two two-hundred-gram beef steaks or a kilogram of pork escalopes for 5 euros.
The food in this photo cost a total of 16 euros: 5 euros pork, 3 euros chicken with rice, 2 euros beer, 1 euro cheese, and the rest of the little things around 1 euro.

Beer is not cheap at all, half a liter of Guinness in the store costs two euros, and the rest is even more expensive. At the bar, a pint costs somewhere from 4 euros.
Restaurants are quite expensive, dishes usually cost at least 10 euros. A visual comparison: at McDonald's in Ireland the current special offer - a menu with double quarter-pounder with cheese costs 8 euros, in the UK the same menu is 5.50 pounds (6 euros).

<b>Other</b>
Ireland uses the euro. Interestingly, the Irish currency was pegged to the British pound until 1979 (30 years after full independence).
Sockets are English-type with three holes, you can clamp the grounding on top with a handle or use a special patch that turns this socket into a regular European one, fortunately I have it, since I’ve been to a bunch of countries with the same sockets (Malta, Cyprus, Malaysia, Hong Kong ).
For the Internet, I used, as usual in Europe, DreamSim (10 euros/GB). Local SIM cards are quite expensive; you can’t buy anything for less than 15 euros, even with a minimum package. In theory, other European SIM cards (for example, Orange) should work in roaming.

<b>What to see</b>
<b>Dublin</b> is the capital, a city of moderate interest. To be honest, coming to Ireland and only seeing Dublin is like coming to New Zealand and only seeing Auckland. After all, Ireland is about nature and landscapes.

<b>Kilkenny</b> is a small old town with a castle.

<b>Sligo</b> is a small town in the northwest. Irish cities are compact and attractive, with a large shopping center and many colorful pubs in the center. Sometimes they don’t hesitate to hang some advertising on half the wall.

<b>Londonderry</b> is a pleasant little city behind walls that you can walk around completely. Formerly the center of religious conflict in Northern Ireland

<b>Coleraine and the Giant's Causeway</b> - the most beautiful landscapes in Northern Ireland and basalt columns.

<b>Belfast</b> is the capital of Northern Ireland. The Titanic was built here and Game of Thrones was filmed here, and one of the most paradoxical monuments to Lenin is located here.

<b>Total</b>
In 8 days I spent about 660 dollars, i.e. ~80 per day, more than half for housing and a third for travel. I also included excursions into transport section, so the remaining 10% comes from food.
