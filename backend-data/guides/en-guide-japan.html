An idiot's dreams came true and I finally visited the last significant country in East Asia that I had never been to before. By tradition, a review of this interesting and rather rarely visited country by Russians.

Kyoto - 3 nights
Osaka - 2 nights
Okayama - 2 nights
Hiroshima - 2 nights
Fukuoka - 1 night
Kagoshima - 1 night
Tokyo - 1 night

<b>Visa</b>
Since 2017, obtaining a visa to Japan for Russian citizens has become dramatically easier. Now it is no more complicated than a visa to <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/369405.html">China</a>: you just need a plane ticket and a bank account statement, plus sketch out the route on one sheet of paper days indicating the addresses of any hotels (no reservation required). The visa is free. If your tickets are for less than 15 days, then the visa period will be 15 days, if more, then 30. If you had a visa before, they can give you a multiple entry visa for three years. The only problem is that you still cannot get this visa abroad, only in Russia.
Until 2017, it was necessary to obtain a visa through a travel agency for 8-10 thousand rubles, and formally all accommodation had to be booked in advance and not cancelled, because of this I visited as many as 106 countries before getting to Japan.

<b>Money</b>
1 dollar = 110 Japanese yen. I bought cash yen in Russia in 2014; in Moscow it is not very difficult to find a bank/exchanger that has them. I paid, as usual, in cash everywhere (except for accommodation on airbnb). Vending machines that sell metro and train tickets do not accept cards, nor do internet cafes.
Japan has a sales tax, like the USA, but its rate is always fixed - 8%. Prices are sometimes indicated with tax, sometimes without, then under the large number without tax there will be a small number with tax. Sometimes it is written 100 + 税, which actually means 108 (100 + tax). For purchases over ~5000 yen, you can get a tax refund (tax free).

<b>Language</b>
There was no language barrier for me here, because I speak Japanese (not fluently, but still). Everyone knows standard Japanese, so there is no problem with dialects, which are quite different.
On transport, everything is duplicated in English, even in smaller towns. Products and price tags - not very good.

<b>Housing</b>
Airbnb RULES in Japan. For 15-25 dollars you can rent an excellent room in any major city. I even had a studio apartment in Hiroshima. Apparently, in Japan it is problematic from a legal point of view to create a mini-hotel or hostel (a new law was recently passed that de facto legalized airbnb). I've stayed in four airbnb places. It was a private house in Tokyo, but apparently all 8 rooms were rented out to tourists. I haven’t seen the owner, you just need to come to the address, the outer door is open. In Kyoto, it looked like a Japanese-style hotel (ryokan), with a futon - a mattress on the floor - and a kotatsu - a table under which you can warm your feet. But without a sign. In Osaka it turned out to be an ordinary hotel, there was even a price tag hanging at the entrance - it was possible not to book, so I overpaid 10% of the airbnb commission. In general, in Osaka you can come to Shin-Imamiya station, there are plenty of hotels there starting from 1200 yen for a single, ~2000 for a double. I didn’t find similar areas in other cities, although near my house in Tokyo in the alleys I came across a couple of hotels for ~2200 per night with signs only in Japanese. There was a studio apartment in Hiroshima, but there were also about five others of the same kind for rent in the same entrance.
My accommodation in Kyoto, about $17 per day:

<img alt="" src="images/guide-japan-678759_original.jpg" title=""/>
<img alt="" src="images/guide-japan-678989_original.jpg" title=""/>
In smaller cities, such cheap airbnb may not be available. But there are alternative options there too. Hostels in Japan are quite good and resemble capsule hotels in that the beds are curtained. I stayed in hostels for one night in Fukuoka and Nagoya, it cost about 1800 yen. In Okayama, I lived in a Japanese sauna, where people with tattoos were not even allowed (in Japan, tattoos are done <b>only</b> by people from the criminal world - the yakuza). There is a capsule hotel on the top floor, and downstairs there is an onsen (Japanese bath) and a sauna. There was a price tag on the counter for 3500 per night, but I booked on agoda.com for 2000.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-japan-680372_original.jpg" title=""/>
Finally, in Matsumoto and Kagoshima, I spent the night in an Internet cafe. This is a specific Japanese feature; it seems to me that they can be considered a kind of landmark. These cafes are equipped with a kind of office cubes with doors, but without a ceiling. Inside is a chair or mattress; a mattress is naturally better for sleeping. There is a computer inside, in the common area there is a machine with free drinks and a library with manga (Japanese comics). There is also a shower, but usually for a fee of 100-300 yen. In principle, spending one night there is quite normal, you can say that in terms of convenience it’s like spending a night on a train in Russia, but here there are showers, drinks, manga and fast Internet. In Matsumoto I came across an expensive Internet cafe (that city is expensive in general), a night there cost 2500, the usual price is around 1700, as was the case in Kagoshima. Plus another 300 you pay for a “club card” if this is your first time at the establishment. The downside of the Internet cafe is that the “night packs” are turned on only in the evening, from 8 o’clock, and the pack is usually 10 hours, that is, if you checked in at 8, you have to check out at 6. According to the usual daily rate, it turns out to be expensive - 400-500 yen per hour. Also, in the Internet cafes the rooms are not locked, so you either need to not go out for a walk, or leave things at your own risk (although in Japan the problem of theft is not acute), or leave them in a storage room for 100 yen, as I did in Kagoshima. At train stations, by the way, luggage storage facilities usually cost 300 yen.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-japan-684161_original.jpg" title=""/>
In addition to the Internet cafe, you can spend the night in a karaoke, there are also separate rooms, but the time is quite limited - usually night packs are somewhere from 11 pm to 5-6 am, and then 300-400 yen per hour. I went to karaoke just during the day, it’s cool. In addition to songs in Japanese, there are many in English, Chinese and Korean.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-japan-682595_original.jpg" title=""/>
A serious disadvantage of hostels, saunas and internet cafes is that if you travel together, the price doubles. In this situation, it’s easier to find something on airbnb for 30-40 dollars; such offers are everywhere.
There are not enough regular hotels and their price tags are high. Near each station there is a representative of the Toyoko inn chain, where the price is somewhere from 4-5 thousand in the middle of nowhere to 8-9 thousand in the center of Osaka.

<b>Intercity transport</b>
99.9% of tourists in Japan buy a JR Pass. In fact, I didn’t find anyone who would have done it differently, well, except for those who hitchhiked (and there were very few of them because of the visa). Let's see if this is really beneficial.
JR pass price:
7 days = 29 thousand yen
14 days = 46 thousand
21 days = 59 thousand
My expenses for three weeks amounted to approximately $300, that is, compared to a 14-day pass (6 days I was in Tokyo, these can be deducted), I saved 35%. Even if I had not used the trick with the Seishun 18 ticket (discussed below), without the pass it would still have been 50 dollars cheaper. At the same time, I traveled a very long way, all the way to the very south, whereas most people only go to Osaka, which is three times shorter.
Usually the logic is this: a round-trip ticket from Tokyo to Osaka costs about 30 thousand, which means a pass for a week will pay for itself. They just forget that a ticket for a <b>Shinkansen</b> (high-speed train) costs that much, but a ticket for a regular train costs half as much. Yes, on a regular train the ride takes 8 hours, not 3, well, it’s not going through a desert, you can get off somewhere along the way. I only had two trips longer than 2 hours, and both were already in the south after Hiroshima. This was argument number one. Argument number two: a plane ticket from Tokyo to Osaka costs $40-50, which is much cheaper than the slowest train and not much longer than the Shinkansen. For those who want to save as much as possible, there is an even cheaper option - a night bus from $30 (and also saves on hotel!). So if your itinerary only includes Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka:
- if you want cheap, take the night bus
- if you want speed, fly by plane
- If you want something interesting, go there by slow trains via Fuji and Nagoya at least, and back by plane.
<i>Local train</i>
<img alt="" src="images/guide-japan-681905_original.jpg" title=""/>

All trains are divided into high-speed (Shinkansen) and regular. They have different platforms and sometimes even different stations. There are divisions inside: there are the fastest shinkansen, which travel from Tokyo to Osaka in 2 hours without stops (they, by the way, are not included in the JR Pass), there are slower ones with several stops. It’s the same with regular trains: there is the slowest one with all the stops, Local (futsuu in Japanese), there is the faster Rapid/Express (kousoku), and there is the even faster Limited Express.
The price has two components: the fare and the cost of the seat reservation. The fare is the same for all trains, from local to shinkansen, but the reservation fee varies greatly. The cheapest option is "Unreserved seat", then theoretically it may be necessary to stand, if you get there during rush hour, a fixed seat is more expensive, and first class (Green car) is twice as expensive. I don’t know exactly how to reserve seats, at least it can be done at the ticket office. I have always traveled only on those trains where there is no need to reserve seats, and accordingly only the basic fare is paid. These are usually only Rapid and Local, although the train to Tokyo-Narita Airport seems to be designated as Limited Express, but you can take it too. Searching for trains is easy: there is a website for this <a href="http://www.hyperdia.com/en/cgi/en/search.html">http://www.hyperdia.com/en/cgi/en/search.html</a>, you need to select only the “Ordinary Train” and “Express” checkboxes.
If you travel on regular trains, the algorithm is as follows: at the station there are automatic machines, above them hangs a diagram of all the nearest lines, on which it is written how much it costs to travel to each station. In the machine click on the button with the desired price, and get a ticket. The ticket contains the name of the departure station and how much you paid. Go through the turnstile and board the train. You can get somewhere and change to another train on another platform; there are turnstiles only at the exit from the station. In principle, you can travel a thousand kilometers this way with a bunch of transfers. There is also a turnstile at the exit that takes your ticket. If you have traveled further than what was paid for on your ticket, there is usually a machine near the exit where you can add the missing amount. At small stations in the outback there may not be turnstiles, then tickets are usually checked at the exit of the train through the first door of the first car, or instead of turnstiles there are validators for smart cards and a controller booth for those with a paper ticket.
<i>Almost empty train in the outback</i>
<img alt="" src="images/guide-japan-682118_original.jpg" title=""/>
Japan has smart cards for travel, each major city has its own, but in recent years they have achieved impressive interchangeability. Using the card from Tokyo you can take the subway in Fukuoka, and you can even get to Osaka with transfers, exit through the turnstile, and about 9,000 yen due for the trip will be debited from the card. In terms of money, however, the card provides almost no benefits. In the Tokyo subway there were only a few yen discounts using PASMO, 237 instead of 240; I didn’t notice any discounts in other cities. It is better to take PASMO rather than SUICA, because the 500 yen deposit and the account balance are returned in full (SUICA deducts 220 yen).
Now about the stellar way to save money. The Seishun 18 ticket costs 11,850 yen and allows 5 days (not necessarily consecutive) of unlimited train travel across the country without paying the base fare. That is, if you go on local ones, where you don’t have to pay extra for a seat, you pay 2,370 yen per day, and you can go as long as you like. At rates 2370, this is approximately 3 hours of travel. I used this ticket for the last part of the trip from Osaka to Kagoshima, saving me about 11,000 yen. There is only one pitfall: this ticket is available only during the holidays: March 1 - April 10, July 20 - September 10, December 10 - January 10.
Intercity buses are consistently cheaper than trains, they run between all major cities, but there is no convenient single search system like Hyperdia for trains. You can buy tickets on the Internet; some large companies have websites in English, while more local ones only have websites in Japanese. In Tokyo, at the bus station (Shinjuku station), tickets are sold in vending machines, the boarding gates are like at the airport, everything is clear.
Suburban buses have an interesting payment system, which is worth talking about separately. When you enter through the back door, you need to take a piece of paper from a special machine where the number of the current stop is printed. At the exit through the front door, you show it to the driver and pay according to the fare, the table from which stop and how much it costs is shown on the board in front of the windshield. A similar system is used in local trains on small lines where there are no turnstiles.

<b>Local transport</b>
There are 4 subway systems in Tokyo: Tokyo Metro, Toei Metro, Yurikamome and Rinkai. The last two are interesting because they are the only ones that go to Odaiba Island. Yurikamome is a hybrid of a train and a bus - it looks like a train, but it rides on wheels instead of rails, but on a track. It has beautiful views. Tokyo Metro and Toei Metro are two subway systems, there are many stations with transfers, but transfers are not free: traveling within the same system is cheaper. Traditionally for Asian countries, the fare depends on the distance, starting at Tokyo Metro from 170 yen, from the center to the edge will be no more than 300. A Tokyo Metro pass for 24 hours costs 600 yen, so if you are not going to sit all the time at one point, then this is the option you need. There is also a ticket for Tokyo + Toei Metro for 900, but I made do with Tokyo Metro - they have twice as many lines, and you can get to all places of interest for tourism, albeit sometimes with small detours.
<i>Metro in Fukuoka:</i>
<img alt="" src="images/guide-japan-682368_original.jpg" title=""/>
In addition to the metro, there are also a bunch of commuter trains that go to neighboring prefectures, which have actually long since merged with Tokyo. The state-owned JR also has a loop line through the main areas of central Tokyo, which JR pass holders like to use. There are many private lines in the suburbs, which are often cheaper than JR. For example, the cheapest way to get to Yokohama is the Tokyu Toyoko line from Shibuya Station, costing only 250 yen versus 400 on JR. The cheapest way to get to Narita Airport by train is the Keisei Line for 1,030 yen to Ueno Station. There is also a bus that costs 900, but it was not convenient for me.
Besides Tokyo, I took the subway in Yokohama, Nagoya, Kyoto, Osaka and Fukuoka. Prices there are a little higher than in Tokyo, starting at around 200. Of the cities I've been to, Kobe, Hiroshima and Kitakyushu (monorail) also have subways. There are large tram systems in Okayama, Hiroshima, Kumamoto, and Kagoshima. In other cities there are buses. For tourists, buses are most relevant in Kyoto, because all the attractions there are located on different outskirts, and there are only 2 metro lines. A full-day ticket costs only 500 yen, and there is a handy map with all the routes.

<b>Food</b>
The Japanese supermarket is simply a temple of food. When I went there, I wanted to buy EVERYTHING. I bought so many ingredients for home that I filled my entire backpack. If you don’t have the opportunity to cook, don’t worry, there are a lot of ready-made dishes there. Hundreds of types of o-bento are the kind of food boxes that Japanese schoolchildren in anime eat during the big break, containing rice, noodles, vegetables, meat/fish in different variations with different sauces. Yakitori skewers, salads, and of course, sushi and sashimi. If you come to the supermarket at 9-10 pm, all this will be sold at a 50% discount, so the prices will not seem high to you even in comparison with Russia. And even without discounts, it’s not that expensive. Especially fish, of course. Many supermarkets even have a microwave after the checkout so you can immediately heat them up.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-japan-677153_original.jpg" title=""/>
The only thing that is very expensive is vegetables and fruits. As in <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/382646.html">South Korea</a>.
Supermarkets are quite common, but if you are too lazy to go far, or it is already very late, then there are always convenience stores of 7-eleven, Family mart (who has been to Thailand and Malaysia, knows) and Lawson chains. They also have o-bento, a little more expensive than in the supermarket, but also in the range of 300-500 yen (just a smaller portion).
<img alt="" src="images/guide-japan-682832_original.jpg" title=""/>

For a snack during the day, rice balls and onigiri triangles are good; they usually cost 100-120 yen (also half price in the evening).
It will be significantly more expensive to eat in restaurants, but still much less than in Europe. You can find ramen noodle soup or udon from 400-500 yen if you look hard enough, or take a business lunch of donburi (rice with mousse and sauce), salad and soup for 800-900 at a chain like Yoshinoya. What can I say, even at the airport a dish costs between 1000-1500 yen in most places.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-japan-680834_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Internet</b>
Until 2016, it was legally prohibited in Japan to sell SIM cards with calling capabilities to non-residents. Now this law has been repealed, and such proposals are beginning to appear. Before, only SIM cards with Internet access were sold; now they are becoming cheaper, but still remain expensive. The cheapest I found was the IIJMIO card, 1 gigabyte for 30 days for 2450 yen. It's funny that many cards have a validity period of only 14 or even 7 days. Like, who would even think of coming to Japan for more than a week?
For locals, prices are several times lower, in the same Yodobashi store I looked at a booklet, the prices were about 3-5 gigabytes for 1000-1500 yen per month.
Free Wi-Fi is available at most train stations, metro stations (but not on the trains themselves), near stores like Lawson, in museums, etc. attractions.

<b>What to see</b>
Japan is often called almost “another planet”. I don’t know, for me another planet is <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/350097.html">USA</a>, where even the measurement systems are different. Japan is a country where everything is arranged in a humane and convenient way, everything is thought out down to the smallest detail and understandable to any child. Well, there are still some problems, but in other countries there are more of them (except perhaps Switzerland). Japan is a country where it’s simply pleasant to be, and what’s important is that it’s five times cheaper than in Switzerland.
There are much fewer old cities left in Japan than in Europe, because, firstly, until the 20th century everything was made of wood, and secondly, the country was damaged during the Second World War. Fortresses and samurai castles were built from stone, but they were deliberately destroyed in the 19th century as a symbol of feudalism after the restoration of imperial power. As a result, there are now only 12 ancient castles left in Japan, all far from large cities, but I still visited five of them. Others have preserved ruins and fortress walls, and in many cities castles were built from scratch in the 1960s, such as in Osaka.
Marugame Castle:
<img alt="" src="images/guide-japan-679671_original.jpg" title=""/>
Matsumoto Castle:
<img alt="" src="images/guide-japan-679770_original.jpg" title=""/>

Old towns with wooden houses are also not easy to find, you need to dig deeper, but I also found a few.
Imai-cho District, Kashihara City:

Magome:
<img alt="" src="images/guide-japan-678351_original.jpg" title=""/>
The nature is very beautiful, most of the country is mountainous outside of overpopulated Tokyo and Osaka. There are also tropical islands in the south that I should visit next time.

I was lucky to catch momiji - the Japanese “golden autumn”, the second most popular period after the spring cherry blossoms.

<img alt="" src="images/guide-japan-684660_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Results</b>
In 20 days, I spent almost exactly $1000 plus the $487 flight cost to Tokyo and back. The biggest expense is transport, as I made a long journey.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-japan-683739_original.png" title=""/>
<img alt="" src="images/guide-japan-683792_original.png" title=""/>
In general, Japan is not a particularly expensive country. More expensive than <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/476637.html">India</a>, of course, but compared to South Korea it is approximately on the same level. It's just that Korea is small, and travel costs there are not so noticeable. I would put Japan on the same level as Spain in terms of prices. Even France and Italy will be more expensive, not to mention really expensive countries like Switzerland and the USA.
