When I was in Hungary for the first time, I didn’t particularly like this country. I thought that I wouldn’t come there again soon, but then Wizz Air started flying to Moscow, and Hungary became the main budget way for me to get to Eastern Europe, and in a couple of years I went there four more times, once I even went there specifically. Then I left Moscow, later other low-cost airlines appeared, and I didn’t travel to Eastern Europe so often, because I saw almost all of it in 2013-2014. And somehow it so happened that I had not been to Hungary for almost ten years. And then in December 2023 I stumbled into Budapest again, so now I can summarize my entire experience in this country.

I have been to Hungary six times:

<b>Transport</b>
There are both buses and trains in Hungary. I almost always traveled by train, as they are usually more frequent than buses and faster.
Tariffs are static, which is rare in Europe these days - the price is always the same. However, the price for reserving a seat is slightly different. On long-distance trains, seat reservations are required, but on short-distance trains with a large number of stops, there are no reservations. Reserving a seat costs 650 forints in advance or 990 on the day of departure. Tickets can be easily purchased from vending machines. There were problems with this before, I remember buying online and printing it out from the machine at the station.
Buses in Hungary run under the Volan brand. There are all sorts of Flixbuses too, but only on international routes, and they don’t sell tickets between two Hungarian cities.
Prices are much lower than in Western Europe, about $4 per hour.

Examples of travel prices:
Budapest - Pecs (240 km).
Train 3950 + 650/990 forints ($13), 2.5 hours travel time.
Bus 3500 forints ($10), 4 hours travel time

Budapest - Székesfehérvár (60 km).
Train 1300 forints (+650 for reservation, but there are many trains on this route without reservation).
Bus 1380 forints ($4), 1 hour journey.

If you want to go to another country, then prices vary greatly depending on the train and departure time.
The most popular direction is Budapest - Vienna. If you buy a ticket in advance, you can grab it for just 13 euros on the train or 10 euros on Flixbus. Not in advance for the train it will cost 35-55 euros, for the bus - from 20.
As far as I know, there are no trains running to Serbia now, although in 2014 I went there in a sleeper car - my first and last time on a sleeper train in Europe.
Trains run to all other neighboring countries (Slovakia, Ukraine, Romania, Croatia, Slovenia). Less often to Slovenia.

To travel around the city in Hungary, tickets are either single-entry or for a specific time. I only used city transport in Budapest; all other cities are small enough to get around on foot.
In Budapest, a single ticket costs 450 forints ($1.30). A ticket for 30 minutes costs 530 forints ($1.50), this is useful if you need to leave the airport, where it first takes 15 minutes by bus, and then you transfer to the metro. For 90 minutes it’s already 750 forints, a 24-hour pass is 2500 forints ($7.20).

<b>Accomodation</b>
Of all the Hungarian cities, I spent the night only in Budapest and once in Szeged. Hungary is a fairly compact country, and you can travel to any city from Budapest in a day.
Budapest is a very popular city. Cheap rooms there may run out, especially on weekends and holidays. On my last trip, I booked at the last minute, so I had to pay 40 euros for a private room in a hostel, and there were few options. If in advance, then in winter even now there are still options around 20-25 euros; in 2014 I paid about the same.
The three-star hotel where I stayed on my very first trip (City Hotel Matyas) went up from 30 euros then to 50-60 now.

<b>Food</b>
In 2014, I called Hungary <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/341519.html">a very budget holiday destination</a>, where everything is cheap compared to both Moscow and Western Europe. Since then, a lot has changed, the dollar to forint exchange rate has increased from 230 to 350 in 9 years, and prices in forints have increased by 2-3 times. For example, entrance to the Szechenyi baths in Budapest now costs 10,000 forints, but then it cost 4,000.
I dined at this establishment (Stex hax) in 2014. Then there was a menu for two that cost 5,500, but now it’s 14,000.

Instead of 100 forints, buns cost 200-300.

Chicken fillet at LIDL - almost $10 per kilo.

My favorite Hungarian dish, goulash in bread, costs 5,000 forints ($15).

McDonald's menu. A combo with a Big Mac costs $6 - cheaper than Western Europe.

<b>What to see</b>
Hungary is divided into seven regions, which consist of 20 districts. I have been to 6 regions and 10 districts.

<b>Budapest</b> is the capital. There is hardly a person who has been to Hungary, but has not been to the capital - it is practically impossible to go past it.

Szentendre:

<b>Northern Hungary</b> - here I was in the city of Eger with a castle and a minaret. Wine is also made in this region (Tokaj)

<b>Southern Plain</b> - Hungarian plain. The main city of Szeged is on the border with Serbia, with a lot of interesting architecture.

Kecskemet is also famous for its Art Nouveau architecture.

<b>Central Transdanubia</b> - here are two popular travel destinations from Budapest. Firstly, Székesfehérvár is the ancient capital of Hungary.

Secondly, Esztergom - on the steep bank of the Danube with a basilica. Here you can walk across the bridge to Slovakia.

<b>Western Transdanubia</b> is a region along the border with Austria and Slovenia. The main city is Győr, located on the route from Vienna to Budapest with a well-preserved center.

Zalaegerszeg is the most remote non-tourist town I've been to in Hungary

<b>Southern Transdanubia</b> - here is the southern, more popular shore of Lake Balaton, on the shore of which you can relax.

There is also the large city of Pecs, interesting for its hilly landscapes, architecture and ancient Roman tombs.

I haven't been only in the easternmost cities of Hungary (Debrecen, Nyiregyháza, Miskolc)
