So, a review of the last continent I visited, Australia, far away and difficult to reach for Russians. There is an opinion that this is a very expensive country, even in “Heads and Tails” every episode about Australia begins with the presenters lamenting that they have to live from hand to mouth. In fact, it turned out that at the current exchange rate, Australia is a country in the middle price category, much like Spain or Greece. Given the availability of numerous inexpensive flights there from Southeast Asia, we have an excellent place to travel (well, if not for the visa).

<b>Visa</b>
A visa to Australia is currently the most difficult for Russian citizens due to the large number of refusals. The requirements are the same as for <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/533372.html">New Zealand visa</a>, I sent the same documents, only I wrote a travel plan with Australia + New Zealand (fewer places than actually turned out). A visa costs 140 AUD (about $100), plus you need to submit your fingerprints at a visa center in Moscow or one of the few cities in Russia (almost 1,500 more rubles). I asked for a multiple entry visa (to travel there and back to New Zealand), the validity of the multiple entry visa is 1 year.
At the same time, the border control itself is incredibly easy, both times it lasted about 30 seconds without a single question, as if I was entering somewhere like Spain. At customs, however, they selectively search for food and other prohibited substances. Theoretically, packaged dry food such as noodles can be imported (fruit, meat, dairy, spices are strictly prohibited), but it is better not to bother with this, especially since all this can be bought quite cheaply inside Australia.

<b>Money</b>
The Australian dollar (AUD) is now equal to 0.7 US dollars. The smallest denomination is 5. Coins are very bulky, especially 20 and 50 cents; 50 cents seems to be the largest and heaviest coin I have ever seen. At the same time, 2 dollars is the smallest coin in diameter, only thick.
ATMs dispense amounts of at least 1000 AUD. There is a commission, 3-4 AUD.
In exchange offices, curiously, the exchange rate is shown for AUD, and not for other currencies, that is, you need to divide by the rate figure, not multiply.

<b>Accomodation</b>
As in New Zealand, Airbnb reigns here. The situation is even better because Australian cities are larger, there are also more housing options and prices are slightly lower. I spent an average of $20 a day on housing, and there was a lot of choice.
Hostels cost 20-25 AUD per day. Cheap hotels - from 50-60.

<b>Transport</b>
Australia is almost as big as America. To travel long distances, you need to either fly or drive a car for a long time through the desert.
There are four main airlines in Australia: Qantas (very expensive), Virgin (cheaper), Tiger Air and Jetstar (low-cost). I have flown with all of them except Qantas, they are essentially the same: luggage is paid everywhere, hand luggage is 7 kilograms. If you get your boarding pass at the counter, they may ask you to weigh it, but they aren't too strict. Australia is the first country I discovered where you can still fly on domestic flights without a passport: if I printed my boarding pass myself or showed it on my phone, they didn’t look at my passport at any stage. In Europe, in recent years, they always look at your passport upon boarding, and in the USA - before security control.
Trains suddenly exist in Australia and can be used. There are two lines across the country: Sydney - Perth and Adelaide - Darwin, but beyond Adelaide only tourist trains run. In the east, there are quite a few passenger lines; fares are competitive with buses and planes (and not like in the USA, where trains are 5 times more expensive). I was traveling on the Sydney-Melbourne long-distance train in a seated carriage, having stopped in the city of Goulburn, from where there is a branch line to Canberra. It was a national holiday that day, and flight prices were higher than usual, and bus prices too, so around AUD 100 per ticket was a reasonable option.
Long-distance buses are mainly provided by Greyhound. They have routes even in the center of the country and in the west, you can get to Perth in a couple of days or cross the desert from south to north from Adelaide to Darwin. The main routes go along the coast Adelaide - Melbourne - Sydney - Brisbane - Cairns. The fare is approximately 10 AUD per hour of travel.

<b>Urban transport</b>
<b>Darwin</b> - quite rare buses around the city. From the airport you need to walk 20-30 minutes to the nearest stop, the fare is 4 AUD
<b>Adelaide</b> has an excellent transport system, there is a metro/train and buses more or less often. I lived in a one-story residential area, and a bus passed by every 15 minutes, and there were also other buses stopping at a stop on the other side of the block. Both days I bought an unlimited pass for 10.30 AUD, which is a lot cheaper than buying one ticket at a time. There is a regular bus from the airport.
<b>Brisbane and Gold Coast</b> - here you need to buy a travel card. The deposit and account balance can be returned in full (for example, at the airport). Several train lines and buses, trains go quite far, all the way to Gold Coast, where the journey takes more than an hour. The Gold Coast also has a tram line that starts from the train station and runs through the main tourist areas. The fare depends on the number of zones and the time of day (more expensive during rush hour), minimum about 2 AUD, to the Gold Coast 6-8. To the airport the increased fare is about 20 AUD. There is an alternative option to take a local bus to a large shopping center, from which there are free shuttles to the airport, but unfortunately this option only works during the daytime.
<b>Sydney</b> - again, trains, buses, the metro will open soon. You need to buy a transport card, it’s free, but you can’t return the balance on your card, and you can only top up with an amount of $10 or more in increments of 5, so plan carefully. The cost of travel is very non-linear: in the morning, during rush hour, to get from my area to the center (20 minutes) cost almost 4 AUD, and at non-rush hour to get to the Blue Mountains (more than an hour and a half journey) cost only 6-7 AUD. There is also a daily limit - 15.80 dollars (and on Sunday it’s less than 3, consider it free), if you spend that much, money will not be deducted further. From the airport by train the fare is much higher, as in Brisbane, but you can walk to the next station (20-30 minutes walk), and then the regular price will apply.
<b>Canberra</b> - there are buses, which are quite rare compared to other cities. Unlimited for the day costs 9 AUD, but I walked everywhere.
<b>Melbourne</b> - a chic system with electric trains and numerous trams that cross the city center along almost all major streets. The fare is very unusual: one trip costs 4.40 (2 hours), and unlimited for the day 8.80 (on weekends and holidays 6.40). You need to buy a travel card for 6 AUD from any machine. The card cannot be returned; you can top it up with any amount, including small coins. You can get to the airport by local bus during the day, and early in the morning only by express for 20 AUD.
<b>Hobart</b> - there are buses here, less often than in large cities. It costs 3.50 to reach the base of Wellington Mountain. Express trains run to the airport for 20, or there is a stop on the highway a 20-minute walk from the airport, where long-distance buses stop, which, however, run very rarely, once an hour or less. You can get there on this bus for 4.80.
<b>Perth</b> - there is no point in buying a card here, it costs $10, and gives a small discount. It’s easier to pay in cash; fortunately, when paying in cash, transfers are free, and you can buy a ticket for the day. A day ticket costs 12.80, the card has the same limit. Can be purchased from any bus driver. A ticket for 2 hours and two zones costs 4.80 (to the airport, for example). Tickets are the same for buses and trains.

<b>Food</b>
The food is great in this country. There are three chains: Woolworths (more expensive), Coles (cheaper), Aldi (cheapest). Usually Woolworths and Coles are in every area somewhere near the metro, Aldi is less common. Prices in the stores are normal, especially if you buy larger packages. Compared to <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/533372.html">New Zealand</a> the prices are noticeably lower: for example, there I bought half a kilo of yogurt for $5, and in Australia a whole kilo for $3-4. The predominant meat is beef; a kilogram costs 15-25 AUD. Kangaroo meat is also sold, but quite rarely, you need to look for it specifically. A pack of pasta can be bought for only 1-2 AUD. I also really liked cold coffee, which is sold in 750 ml bottles and 2 liter canisters - just for me, unlike Asian micro-jars of 150-200 ml, and a bottle costs 3-4 AUD.

You can buy fruit inexpensively at the market: apples and tangerines cost from 2 AUD per kilogram.
In restaurants, prices are approximately the same as in New Zealand: 10-12 AUD in a Chinese canteen, from 20 in a regular restaurant. In fast food like McDonald's, it's almost the same, with New Zealand dollars replaced by Australian ones: a lunch with a quadruple Big Mac costs 12-13 AUD.

<b>Internet</b>
I used DreamSim, the tariff is 10 euros/gigabyte. Local operators offer packages around 10 AUD per 1 gigabyte.

<b>What to see</b>
At first glance, it seems that Australia is a large desert, but in fact all populated areas are much more lively, and in the very south in Tasmania it is generally quite cool, it is at the same latitude as the south of New Zealand.
It so happened that I visited all the first level administrative divisions in Australia - it became only the third country where I visited all regions after <a href="http://goo.gl/6Fme4K">Malaysia</a> and <a href="http://goo.gl/JpfVWc">Belarus</a>. So I’ll go through the cities and regions.
<b>Darwin (Northern Territory)</b> is in a sparsely populated state, the southern part of which is the hottest part of the desert, where the famous Ayers Rock is located, and the north is tropical jungle, like in neighboring Indonesia. I had little time in Darwin, and because the plane was very late, I had even less, so I only looked at the giant saltwater crocodiles in the nursery in the city center, but in general if you go a little out of town, there are plenty of them in the river, and there are special boat trips to see them in the wild.

<b>Adelaide (South Australia)</b> is a beautiful city where I first saw a wild kangaroo (in Belair National Park).
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946231408_2ea372368f_h.jpg"/>
In general, surprisingly, Australia has many beautiful old cities with 19th century buildings, for example, Port Adelaide, Fremantle (a suburb of Perth), Brunswick (a suburb of Melbourne), Goulburn in New South Wales.

<b>Brisbane and Gold Coast (Queensland)</b> are two neighboring large cities with skyscrapers and surf beaches on the Gold Coast.

I also managed to go to the Glasshouse Mountains National Park nearby. The same state to the north is home to the Great Barrier Reef, one of the world's most famous diving sites.

<b>Sydney (New South Wales)</b> - main city, opera house, bridge, coastal cliffs, mangrove forests right in the city, and the Blue Mountains an hour and a half away.

<b>Canberra</b> is the capital of Australia. You can get around in a few hours.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945069357_bc38589d05_h.jpg"/>
<b>Melbourne (Victoria)</b> is the second city in the country, with a lot of beautiful architecture.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945069307_a4849b790e_h.jpg"/>
And nearby is the most famous places in Australia - the Great Ocean Road (a full-day excursion costs about 100 AUD).

<b>Hobart (Tasmania)</b> is the coolest place I've been to during the golden autumn. There is Mount Wellington nearby, you can get there by car/bus, and walk down in 2 hours from the cold rocks into the almost tropical forest below.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946231373_af1658fc3e_h.jpg"/>
<b>Perth (Western Australia)</b> is a city on the other side of the continent, in the largest state. Here I saw plenty of wild kangaroos and swans. And nearby is Rottnest Island, where there are picturesque beaches, pink lakes and quokkas - those little plump kangaroos that are not afraid of people.

<b>Results</b>
I really liked Australia, perhaps it is now one of my favorite countries. Incredible proximity to nature, beautiful landscapes, excellent infrastructure, inexpensive - what more do you need? I want to come there again.

In 18 days I spent $1656 including domestic flights. There was a gap, because I flew to New Zealand from Brisbane and flew back to Sydney, but you can fly between these cities for about 50 dollars. The statistics were slightly spoiled by the fact that in mid-April there were national holidays: first Easter, then Veterans Day (World Wars 1 and 2), this significantly increased the prices of air tickets and even buses. But minus long-distance intercity transport, what do we have left? 20 dollars a day for housing and 10 for daily marbled beef steaks, another 5-10 for travel around the city. In some Italy you will need more money just for the hotel.
