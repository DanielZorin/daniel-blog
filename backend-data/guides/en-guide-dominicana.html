Well, I survived a week in the Dominican Republic. Somewhere on the third day, after leaving Santo Domingo, I began to be indifferent to what was happening and was able to return to work. Since I have been in this country for quite a long time, I can write a review with all the points. Later there will be a general overview of the Caribbean islands as a whole.

<b>Entry</b>
Entry is $10, exit is $20. However, the exit tax when departing from Puerto Plata was included in the ticket, although I was sure otherwise.

<b>Currency</b>
$1 = 46.4 pesos. The rate at different banks and exchangers is almost the same.

<b>Accomodation</b>
Hotels start at around $10. The very bottom level hotels can be found cheaper, about 6 dollars, but you have to look hard. Air conditioning is usually about 200 pesos more expensive, but by and large air conditioning is not needed, at least in November. This is not Thailand or Malaysia. As in other Latin American countries, single room is much cheaper than twin.
I looked for hotels locally; the cheapest ones were not listed on the Internet. Wi-fi was available in all of them. Specific prices:
Santo Domingo, Motel Xinhua. The first day is 600 pesos because I checked in at 7 pm, the second day is 800 pesos. Air conditioning, hot water.
Jarabacoa, Hotel Central (apparently the only budget hotel in the center). 550 pesos.
Santiago, Hotel Dorado. 500 pesos.
Puerto Plata, Hotel King (near the Caribe tours bus station), 950 pesos. Air conditioner.
An extremely unpleasant feature of this country is that loud music is played everywhere at night. In ALL four hotels it disturbed my sleep, least of all in Santiago, because fortunately there was no window in the room. Dominicans absolutely do not care that someone might want to sleep; they can drive around the city in a car with the radio turned on to maximum at three in the morning; live orchestras loudly play their three-song repertoire right on the outdoor verandas. Every time I had the feeling that I was staying on Khao San Road, although, for example, in Puerto Plata the hotel was on the very outskirts, 3 kilometers from the center.

<b>Food</b>
Eating in a canteen, which is called Comedor here (literally means “eating room”), costs about 100-120 pesos ($2-3). A typical lunch consists of a couple of pieces of chicken a la KFC, a snack - French fries or, more often, fried bananas, some kind of refreshing drink.

A Big Mac lunch at McDonald's costs about 250 pesos (tax is added to the prices at the window). Interestingly, there are triple and even quadruple Big Macs for a small increase in cost. The Quadruple Big Mac combo costs P295.
There are supermarkets even in small towns. Oddly enough, the Dominican Republic has inexpensive meat (chicken from $2, pork from $5-6), but fruits are quite expensive. Watermelon costs $2 per kilogram! The cheapest are bananas ($1 kilo) and tangerines (I found them for $1.5). There are no exotic fruits in the Dominican Republic; all fruits can be bought cheaper in Russia, even in winter. Seafood is fresh and inexpensive. You need to move away from the resort area.

<b>Transport</b>
If possible, it is better to travel by Caribe Tours buses. They have normal bus stations (not in the center, but not on the very outskirts either). They cost about 1.5 pesos per kilometer, that is, not much more expensive than in Thailand. There are also local minibuses - guagua. Where they compete with Caribe Tours, they are only slightly cheaper, and where they do not compete, they are even more expensive (Jimani - Santo Domingo is 240 kilometers for 500 pesos), while their speed is even lower than in Indonesia - 20 kilometers per hour on average.
There is a new metro in Santo Domingo that you can try out of curiosity. Fare is 20 pesos + 15 pesos single ticket (or 60 pesos reusable). Minibuses with an incredible degree of destruction run through the cities; passenger cars with rusty bodies and broken bumpers also act as public transport. You can travel relatively inexpensively by motorcycle taxi. For example, in Sosua (it’s like a tourist zone), I agreed to get to the airport about 7 kilometers for 120 pesos ($2.6). For comparison, in Cambodia it would cost $2 after hard bargaining. Regular taxis exist only for gringo tourists and charge exorbitant prices. The same trip to the airport costs as much as $25 without any prospects for bargaining, and those who are especially arrogant can ask for $25 per person. In Santo Domingo, prices start at 1000 pesos (&gt;$20).

<b>Internet</b>
I made a mistake and bought a Claro SIM card, which has a 3G network on American frequencies, because of this I only had 2G. I should have taken Orange. An internet package for a week costs 250 pesos. Finding an office where they will sell a SIM card is not an easy task; I succeeded at the third try.

<b>Overall</b>
The Dominican Republic is a terrible country, which I definitely won’t go to a second time, and I don’t advise you to go to for the first time. There is garbage and Manila-level trash all around. Even beaches outside of expensive hotels are often polluted. You shouldn’t walk the streets at night (only clubs with loud music are open). In Santo Domingo, on the main street where tourists from the cruise ship walk, police officers stand on every corner, which is symbolical. A bunch of shady guys begging for money. The service sector is at the level of the USSR: “There are many of you, I am alone,” be it a communication shop, a hotel or McDonald’s, they respond in the following tone: “What are you stopping for, there are all sorts of people walking around here.” I also speak Spanish quite well (by the way, the local dialect is quite easy to understand if you have studied standard Spanish), but the spherical gringo will probably be completely devoured.

There is nothing to see, except that the center of Santo Domingo.
The only serious advantage of the Dominican Republic is that it is cheap compared to other islands in the Caribbean. It turns out to be a low-end vacation at sea that can be combined with inexpensive sex tourism, if you like local ladies. Such a Caribbean Pattaya, only with less traffic and without Thai cuisine. If you live in the USA, then it is better to go to Mexico - it is much more interesting, tastier, less scary, there is a sea and the prices are about the same. If you live in Europe, then you generally have a wide choice.
Yes, there are also five-star all-inclusive hotels in the Dominican Republic, built by Americans for Americans and securely separated from the surrounding trash by barbed wire. But something tells me that with an appropriate budget, it’s better to go to Miami, where you don’t have to disdain going outside the hotel gates.

<b>Results</b>
In seven days I spent $175 excluding entry fees. $14 average hotel (6 nights), $7 per day for food.
