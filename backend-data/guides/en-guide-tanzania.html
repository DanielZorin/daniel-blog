Tanzania is one of the most popular and interesting countries in Africa. There are beaches, mountains, and safaris.

<b>Visa</b>
You can get a visa at the border. A standard 90-day visa costs $50. There is also a 7-day transit visa for $30 and a multiple-entry visa for $100. The visa is not pasted into the passport, only a stamp is put.
The $50 visa is actually multiple-entry! I couldn't find any information about this anywhere, the official website says that it is Single entry. So when I realized that I needed to visit Tanzania twice, the first time in transit between Burundi and Rwanda, I planned to get a multiple-entry visa. However, after some discussion, the border guards said that a $50 visa was enough for me. And so it turned out - the second time I entered from Kenya, I didn't pay anything. Perhaps this only works at land borders. 

<b>Base</b>
British-style sockets.
$1 = 2700 Tanzanian shillings. There are notes of 10,000, 5,000, 2,000, 1,000 and coins of 500, 200, 100. I didn't use ATMs, I only changed cash.

<b>Transport</b>
There are trains in Tanzania, and quite long ones. They have two different operators. In the north, you can check the schedules and tickets on the <a href="https://eticketing.trc.co.tz/">website</a>. Currently, trains run on the Dar es Salaam - Dodoma - Kigoma and Dar es Salaam - Dodoma - Mwanza routes.
Prices are quite low:
Dar - Dodoma
Third class 13,600 shillings ($5)
Second class seated 26,400 ($10)
Second class sleeper 34,900 ($15)

Dodoma - Mwanza
Third class 19,000 shillings ($8)
Second class seated 37,600 ($16)
Second class sleeper 50,700 ($19)

For comparison, the Dar - Dodoma bus seems to cost around 20-25 thousand.
The second line goes south to Zambia, called Tazara (TAnzania ZAmbia RAilway). I couldn't find online purchases here. Trains run twice a week to Kapiri-Mposhi in Zambia (in Tanzania they pass through Mbeya, from where you can go to Malawi), from where trains should go further to Lusaka and Livingstone.

I've traveled little over long distances, only to Arusha from the Kenyan border. The minibus to Moshi for 2000 there was, as usual, cramped and stopping everywhere. The big bus from Moshi to Arusha for 10,000 was good. There seem to be a lot of buses, at least in Moshi and Arusha.
From Arusha I flew to Zanzibar by plane. There are a lot of airlines in Tanzania, more than 5 for sure. The prices are not low, a ticket somewhere from Dar es Salaam costs at least $80, and more than $100. And to Arusha it is even more expensive, since there is a lot of demand. The only cheap flight is from Dar to Zanzibar, the minimum price there is around $35, which is equivalent to a ferry. I actually used the hidden city trick for once, buying a ticket Arusha - Zanzibar - Dar in one booking, which was much cheaper than just Arusha - Zanzibar with the same airline. I thought about taking it to Dar just to reduce the price, but then I saw that the second segment does not have to be on the same day, but can be in three days. Great, at the same time I did not have to sail on a ferry, which is said to have terrible pitching. <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945053077_654d5ef503_o.jpg" title=""/>
In Zanzibar and Dar es Salaam, I traveled only by public transport, which is represented by buses (not minibuses). In Zanzibar, there used to be minibuses and trucks converted for passengers (like in Thailand), the latter still remain on some routes, but most have been replaced by buses, so traveling around the island is now more or less comfortable (by African standards). Travel around Zanzibar city costs 500 shillings (less than $0.20), including to the airport. To other cities depends on the distance, to the farthest Nungwi in the north and Jambiani in the south costs 2500 (less than $1).

In Dar es Salaam, the fare depends on the area, the fares on the side of the bus are from 600 to 1200. From the airport to the city center it costs 700. The buses are terribly crowded, I rode standing.
There are taxis Bolt and Uber, in Zanzibar only Uber. From Dar airport to the center it costs ~13,000 by car or ~9,000 by tuk-tuk.

<b>Housing</b>
In the town of Ngara between the borders of Burundi and Rwanda, there was the cheapest housing in recent times - only 10,000 shillings ($3.5). The shower was cold, but after a whole day of driving I didn't care. Even in such a small remote town there were several hotels.

In Arusha, Zanzibar, Dar, the hotels that I came across cost 35-40 thousand (~$15), and that was with air conditioning. In Zanzibar, I lived in Stone Town, so that it would be convenient to travel everywhere. In general, there are also many budget accommodations in the resorts in the range of 20-30 dollars.
In Dar, I stayed opposite the airport, since I had an early flight.

<b>Food</b>
Like Kenya, Tanzania has Indian influences, as well as Arab ones, especially in Zanzibar, which was long under the rule of the Sultan of Oman. Typical food is in the form of a South Indian thali:
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946278723_42a118bb63_o.jpg" title=""/>
Rice, ugali (corn porridge), maharage (beans), matembele (sweet potato leaves), and several types of curry.
Prices in Zanzibar are on average about the following:

That is, eating in a restaurant costs about 5 dollars. In Nungwi it is more expensive. But it is delicious.

If you want to save money, you should turn to street food. In Tanzania, it seems, street food is more developed than in other African countries. There are entire night markets, just like in Thailand. In Zanzibar, in the capital, on the embankment, is the most popular tourist one. There you can eat crab and lobster kebabs for 15,000 shillings.

And also "Zanzibar pizza" (similar to Japanese okonomi-yaki) for 3-5 thousand.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946016211_497eaecd95_o.jpg" title=""/>
But closer to my hotel there was also a night market, where the prices were half as much (for example, sugarcane juice cost 2000, not 4000). But the kebabs there were only regular ones, beef and chicken. For 500 shillings.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946015726_bc9686ef68_o.jpg" title=""/>
There was a similar night market with low prices in Dar es Salaam, in a completely non-central area near the airport, where I spent the night. And in the town of Ngara I ate these kebabs, similar to Kenyan ones, for 6000 a large portion.

<b>Internet</b>
As usual, I bought a SIM card from someone at the border. 5 gigs for a week cost 10,000 ($3.5), 1.5 gigs for a day cost 2500 ($1).

<b>What to see</b>
Zanzibar Island is the main tourist destination in Tanzania. There are direct flights from Europe and even charters. The historic center of the island's capital (Stone Town) is listed as a World Heritage Site.

But of course, people mostly come here for the beach. Nungwi Beach is in the very north of the island. This, as I understand it, is the most popular place, there are quite a lot of people, and the prices in the restaurants are much higher than usual.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945115842_e6621a4478_o.jpg" title=""/>
I also went to the other end of the island to the beaches of Jambiani and Paje. I liked Jambiani the most, it is as beautiful as Nungwi, but the water is much cleaner without algae, there are much fewer people, the prices are lower. In Paje, there are mainly kitesurfers.

Dar es Salaam is the former capital and largest city. The city is quite interesting, after many sprawling villages with markets in Africa, it is impressive.

Arusha is a large city in the north, closer to Kenya, a base for trips to national parks and Mount Kilimanjaro. Kilimanjaro struck me with its invisibility. That's how I saw the highest peak in Africa from the nearest city of Moshi. The summit is about 20 kilometers away.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946412055_4c311e77f9_o.jpg" title=""/>
For comparison, this is what Mount Fuji (2000 meters lower than Kilimanjaro) looks like from a distance of 50 kilometers.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946307209_61ce7fbd8c_o.jpg" title=""/>
You can climb Kilimanjaro, it is relatively easy (compared to climbing most mountains of the same height), since the mountain is quite flat, and you do not need mountaineering equipment to climb it, in fact, it turns out to be a hike, like in Nepal to Annapurna or to the Everest base camp. The climb takes 5 days, and is done only in a group with a guide, it costs a couple of thousand dollars at least.

There are several national parks for safari near Arusha. The most famous are Ngorongoro and Tarangire. Further away is the largest park Serengeti (in Kenya on the other side of the border is the Masai Mara Park, in fact it is one ecosystem). Safari in Tanzania is probably the most expensive of all African countries. In Arusha, in the hotel where I stayed overnight, there was a travel agency, just like in Southeast Asia (I have not seen anything like this in other African countries). Out of curiosity, I found out whether it was possible to join a group and how much it would cost. They said that a one-day safari in Ngorongoro costs $250, in Tarangire - $200, and a two-day safari in both parks costs $360.
In Zanzibar, I saw a sign with prices like this (I assume that the flight is not included in this price). It turns out that it is cheaper to buy on the spot in Arusha, which is logical. Parks in the south of Tanzania are cheaper (but still much more expensive than in South Africa), but I am not sure that it is easy to join a group there, you need to look for a tour in advance. <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946278843_9811e19cf7_o.jpg" title=""/>

<b>Expenses</b>
Except for the very expensive safari, Tanzania is cheap and a very nice country. The beaches in Zanzibar are also great. I would love to come back someday.
