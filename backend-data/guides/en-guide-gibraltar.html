At the end of July, after a year and a half break, I visited Europe, traveled to familiar places and visited several new ones. The start was in Spain, and the intermediate ending was in Poland, which I will write about separately. In Western Europe, I visited seven countries at once: Spain, Gibraltar (a British overseas territory), Portugal, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium.

The route by city was as follows: Malaga - Granada - Malaga - La Linea - Gibraltar - Algeciras - Seville - Beja - Lisbon - Porto - Strasbourg - Stuttgart - Speyer - Mainz - Koblenz - Cologne - Aachen - Maastricht - Liege - Huy - Namur - Brussels - Charleroi

A year and a half in Asia has greatly changed my perception of prices. What can I now say about Europe, taking into account the new experience?
Let's go through the standard points.

<b>Housing</b>
Now is the best time to rent a room through airbnb.com. A couple of years ago I almost never found interesting offers there, but now the competition has become enormous, and if you are very lucky, you can even stay at a “Thai” price of about 10-15 dollars. I averaged $25 a day for housing for two weeks. I stayed in hotels three times: near the border with Gibraltar for 25 euros, in Lisbon and in Stuttgart for 30. The cheapest airbnb was in Seville - $12, in Porto - $15. In Malaga, Strasbourg, Aachen for about $25. The most expensive was in Brussels for $31, although it was an entire studio apartment, not just one room.
Southeast Asia has changed my perception of air conditioning. Previously, I had no idea about the importance of this device, and now I understand why: in Europe, by and large, air conditioners are not urgently needed. Even in the south of Spain during the day, when it's 40 degrees, it doesn't seem hot compared to Thailand. You can go into the shade of any house and relax.

Do you know how much it costs to rent a room in Spain for a month? Admire:

180 euros per month! And for 450 you also get three meals a day!

<b>Transport</b>
Travel is very expensive. For example, a bus from Malaga to Granada (less than 2 hours, 120 km) costs 12 euros. For comparison, a bus for the same distance in Malaysia will cost 12 ringit, that is, five times cheaper, while the comfort in Malaysia is even higher. Incomes in Spain are clearly not five times higher than in Malaysia, so travel is less affordable for Spaniards in this regard. Spain is still a relatively cheap country. In Germany, an hour's trip on the cheapest train will cost 10 euros, in France - 15.
The cheapest mode of transport is almost always a plane, so if you need to cover a distance of more than 400 kilometers, then you should first check the skyscanner. For international flights, prices vary greatly depending on where Ryanair, Easyjet and Wizzair fly. For example, from Portugal there are a lot of cheap flights to France from Ryanair, to different cities, including those whose names were not even familiar to me. But there are almost no cheap flights to Spain or Germany from Portugal. For some reason, cheap flights to Poland are only available from Belgium. Not from France, not from the Netherlands, not from Germany, but only from Belgium. How to travel across Europe cheaply? Porto - Strasbourg for 35 euros + Brussels/Charleroi - Warsaw for 20 euros. I turned the trip from Strasbourg to Brussels into a whole mini-trip.

There is no truly cheap alternative to public transport, other than hitchhiking. Renting a car will be even more expensive if you take into account expensive gasoline, parking in the center and paying rent on days when you don’t have to go anywhere. In some countries, blablacar.com may help you save money. It works best in France (well, with their prices and terrible schedules, it's no wonder blablacar was invented there) and Spain. There are few offers on BlablaCar for short distances. In Germany, Blablacar is less useful, because there is an all-day train ticket for 52 euros for two, so any route longer than 300 km is definitely cheaper to travel by train. In Portugal, a Blablacar is the same price as a bus, even on the seemingly most popular route Lisbon-Porto. But in Spain I traveled everywhere by Blablacar, it saved 30-40 percent compared to the bus. The best deal was Seville-Lisbon (400 km) for 22 euros per person, while the bus costs more than 50 even if purchased in advance.
One of the disadvantages of Blablacar is that it is advisable to know at least a little Spanish, and very carefully arrange a meeting if you do not have mobile Internet. And always keep in mind a backup option with a bus if there are no offers on Blablacar.
I avoided traveling around the city as much as possible, because one trip costs 1.5-2 euros. I only traveled by transport to airports.

<b>Food</b>
The cost of food in Europe compared to housing and transport is simply microscopic. I spent even less than in Southeast Asia. Why? It’s very simple: in Europe there are almost no restaurants with reasonable prices, which means that all food is bought in the supermarket. Since airbnb apartments have a kitchen and refrigerator, you can eat not only cold snacks, but also fried meat.
Briefly about the restaurants: at a reasonable price they are only available in Spain and Portugal. Spanish "tapas" for 2-3 euros will be larger in size than the average "full" dish in a Russian restaurant. There are places in Portugal where the dish costs about the same. As a result, on the Iberian Peninsula you can eat for two for 10 euros. Eating like this twice a day will still be a bit expensive, so it’s more of an entertainment to get acquainted with the local cuisine.
Dinner for 11 euros:

In France, Germany, Belgium, everything is so bad that you can’t even look at restaurants. Unless for the purpose of having fun over the menu, where some pho soup (which in Vietnam costs at most 2 euros in an expensive restaurant) will be offered for 10 euros, and chicken with rice or fries - for 15. There is also shawarma for 5 euros - perhaps the cheapest that can be found in these countries, or a Big Mac menu for 6 euros. But all this is very expensive compared to what you can buy in a store for the same money. In general, restaurants in Europe exist 45% for pumping money out of tourists (on the main streets - 90%), 45% for locals who want to sit with friends once a week, and 10% for people with incomes much higher than average who can afford to eat there every day.
Typical prices in Belgium in a non-tourist location:

In stores, food is sold at very affordable prices. Unlike the USA, in any city in Europe a supermarket is always within walking distance (maximum 2 kilometers). The diet is radically different from Southeast Asia. If there is no kitchen, then two products will play the main role: cheese and sausage. Both are absent in Southeast Asia in principle (more precisely, only imports from Europe are sold at a five-fold premium). The price will be 5-8 euros per kilogram, because a 250 gram piece of brie cheese costs 1.2-1.8 euros, a 200 gram slice of sausage can cost even less than 1 euro. You can also try cheap yoghurts and sweet desserts from 0.15 to 0.5 euros per piece.
Typical diet, all this cost 6.50 euros (Germany):

<b>Internet</b>
I haven't fully understood this point. The general gist is this: prices for mobile Internet in Europe are quite reasonable, comparable to China, Malaysia, Thailand. More expensive than in Russia, Indonesia, Cambodia, Sri Lanka. But it’s a pity to buy a SIM card for a couple of days, because the starter pack costs around 10 euros. Yes, it includes a gigabyte of data for a month or so, so the price is normal, but you don't need that much for a couple of days. From what I saw: in Spain the standard price is 15 euros per SIM card + gigabyte for a month, there are only a couple of small virtual operators for 10. In Belgium and Germany 10 euros is the standard price. In France it is expensive - 20 euros.
What I still haven’t found out in detail is whether it is possible to buy a SIM card in any country that will work in roaming in another EU country at the usual rate. <a href="http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/Germany">The well-known wiki</a> claims that German Vodafone SIM cards can do this.


<b>Results</b>
14 days in Europe = $1000 ($70 per day). Plus, two tickets from Moscow to Malaga cost almost $250 and a Schengen visa cost $65 each. After that I ended up in Warsaw, but that's another story.

$70 a day is, of course, a lot, but on the other hand, in <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/382646.html">Korea</a> it was almost $60, despite the fact that I moved less, distances were shorter. Almost $400 was spent on travel, but the distance covered by land was almost 2000 kilometers.
If you compare this with my travels around Europe in 2011-2014, it turned out to be much cheaper. There, the standard budget was 3,000 rubles = $100 (although the dollar was cheaper to the euro then), and on the most expensive trip to Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Germany, it was generally $130, for short distances.
In general, if you go slowly, select accommodation based on the price of airbnb, and wait for a suitable Blablacar, you can reduce the cost to $40 per day. That is, a whole month in Spain or Germany will cost $1200-1300, not that expensive.

In general, Europe is good - beautiful almost everywhere, there are no blatant scams, no need to bargain, no broken sidewalks, no one rides motorcycles, excellent cheese and sausage, chocolate; alcohol is cheap and fine. There are also disadvantages - travel is very expensive, you need to cook yourself, you won’t be able to go to a restaurant to eat steaks; a lot of time is spent on planning because everything needs to be booked in advance; beautiful nature is not enough; There are no good beaches either.
This is what I saw.
Seville is a very pretentious place.

Gibraltar is a new country for me, the 91st in a row.
