I'm spending this spring in South America. Due to coronavirus restrictions, visiting many countries is now impossible or problematic, but I have already discovered one new country this year, Bolivia. One of the most colorful and unusual countries in Latin America, located high in the Andes.
I was in Bolivia for 20 days, from March 27 to April 16, 2021.

Bolivia consists of 9 provinces, of which I have been to 5. The majority of the population is in the western part of the country, in the mountains and on the Altiplano plateau (at the junction of the borders of Peru, Chile and Bolivia). The eastern and northern parts of the country are plains, swamps and tropical forests. I deliberately did not go there (with the exception of the large city of Santa Cruz) not only because it is far away, but also because the Amazon and Pantanal can be seen from Brazil, where it is cheaper and there is a better chance of finding a group for a tour. Of the cities, I skipped the fourth largest city, Cochabamba, as it was not on the route.


<b>Entry, restrictions</b>
In general, Bolivia, like all other independent countries in South America, has visa-free entry with a Russian passport, but nowadays the situation is complicated. When I entered, the requirement was simple - you need a PCR test for coronavirus, done 3 days before entry (in Brazil it is not a problem to do one at the Sao Paulo airport). On April 7, Bolivia essentially closed for tourism - a 10-day quarantine was introduced for all visitors, no matter where from. How it is organized, I don’t know, I suspect that it’s not strictly enforced, so adventurers can try to ignore it - it’s difficult to track someone in Bolivia, this is not Xinjiang or Moscow, there are no cameras hanging anywhere, bus tickets are sold for cash and written in a notebook; in hotels they keep books.
You can get a coronavirus test in Bolivia in La Paz and Santa Cruz at the Labogen laboratory. It is expensive - 600 Bolivianos ($90), results come within a day.
There were no restrictions inside Bolivia, except for the requirement to wear masks (even on the street). Though no one is checking this, most people wear a mask on the street. Also, when entering stores and some other places, they may pour spirit on your hands. Restaurants and shops are open without restrictions; in general, activity on the street and in transport is high, hardly lower than before the coronavirus.

<b>Money</b>
Bolivia's currency is called the boliviano, or colloquially simply peso/pesito (as in many other Spanish-speaking countries). 1 dollar = 7 bolivianos, that is, to convert to rubles you can multiply by 10. There are banknotes of 10, 20, 50, 100 bolivianos, and coins of 5, 2, 1, 0.50, 0.20 and 0.10. The last two coins are rare, so almost all prices are rounded up to a whole or at least half a Boliviano.
ATMs give out a maximum of 2,000 Bolivianos, some have a commission (especially at the airport), Ganadero and Banco Union banks do not.

<b>Language</b>
The Spanish language in Bolivia seemed more or less understandable to me, more difficult to understand than in Mexico or the Dominican Republic, but much easier than in Argentina. It’s funny that the initial and double R in the Bolivian dialect turned into [z] (in Portuguese in the same positions it turned into "French" R), which is why my last name could be spelled RORIN.
Aymara, Quechua and many other languages are also spoken. According to statistics, only 60% of the population speaks Spanish as their native language.

<b>Accomodation</b>
Hotels for the most part are not represented in booking systems, especially in smaller cities. In Potosi, for example, there are about 10 hotels on booking, and only a couple of inexpensive ones, although in reality there are many more. A normal room costs somewhere between 100 and 200 bolivianos. There are cheaper options, but once I lived in one for 60 Bolivianos, I didn’t want to anymore - there was no hot water, and this in Bolivia means that you basically can’t wash yourself (unless you’re ready to douse yourself with really ice-cold water ).

The cheapest accommodation was in La Paz and Lake Titicaca, perhaps due to an oversupply due to the lack of foreign tourists. In all this time, I have only seen foreign tourists, oddly enough, in Santa Cruz. Even at the Uyuni salt flat, only Bolivians from other cities were on the excursion.
Most hotels over 100 bolivianos have a free breakfast, which usually includes papaya, watermelon, buns, cheese, ham and eggs.

<b>Transport</b>
First, how to get there. Land borders in South America were almost all closed in the spring of 2021, and travel between countries is only possible by plane. This is a rather unconventional way of getting into Bolivia; I think 99% of tourists previously entered this country by land from Chile or Peru. Planes fly mainly to the city of Santa Cruz (and in 2021 from abroad - only to it), which is not touristic and is located far from the main attractions. In the spring of 2021, there were more or less regular flights to only three countries: Brazil, Panama and the USA (Miami), and there were also flights to Peru and Argentina, which are closed to tourists, a couple of times a week. Tickets to Panama and the USA cost under $1000, and to Brazil it was affordable - I took a round-trip flight for about $200.
Unlike Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru, domestic flights in Bolivia are very expensive and do not provide much practical value to tourists. Tickets for even the most frequent routes such as La Paz - Santa Cruz cost around $100, while a bus costs no more than $20.
There are theoretically trains in Bolivia, but they run a couple of times a week at best, so you are unlikely to use them unless you plan a route specifically for this purpose. As far as I understand, now there is passenger traffic only on one branch from the border with Argentina towards Oruro through the Uyuni salt marsh.
The bus is the main method of transportation. As in other South American countries, many companies compete with each other, and each has its own office with touts at the bus station. Tickets are not electronic - your names will be recorded in the passenger table. In addition to buses, there are minibuses that can go not from the main bus stations, but from small ones. Travel by minibus is a little more expensive.
It is interesting that in Bolivia the fee for using the bus station is not included in the ticket, and you need to buy a ticket in a separate window to enter the platform for 1-3 Bolivianos. For this reason, some people catch the bus when it leaves the station on the street.
The fare is quite low; the two of us traveled the entire route for $100:
Santa Cruz - Sucre - 110 bolivianos (night bus)
Sucre - Potosi - 20 bolivianos
Potosi - Uyuni - 35 bolivianos
Uyuni - Oruro - 30 bolivianos
Oruro - La Paz - 50 bolivianos
La Paz - Copacabana - 25 bolivianos minibus, 20 bolivianos bus (+2 additional bolivianos crossing to the other side of Lake Titicaca)
La Paz - Coroico - 30 bolivianos

There are buses and minibuses running inside the cities, there is no route map (only for Santa Cruz there is an inconvenient application), you can only navigate by the names of streets/objects on the windshield. The fare is 1.5-2 bolivianos in different cities.
There are also collective taxis (“trufis”) - passenger cars that serve as minibuses. I’ve never ridden them, they seem to be more expensive than buses.
There are also regular taxis, as a rule they are quite old cars. There are no meters, you need to negotiate, but it seems that in Bolivia it is not customary to charge five times the price, as happens in some countries. My experience confirms this; the price has always suited me (2-3 dollars for a trip around the city). There is also Uber in Santa Cruz and La Paz.

La Paz has a unique transport system - a network of cable cars. In 2013, there were none at all, but by 2020, as many as 10 lines had been built, which form a network, so that you can go around the entire city in a circle. The fare is 3 bolivianos, you have to pay for each transfer. If you have a transport card, then transfers will cost 2 bolivianos, you can also buy a ticket at the ticket office for one trip to the desired station, then it will also be calculated taking into account the discount for the transfer.

<b>Food</b>
The food in Bolivia turned out to be quite good and varied. A regular lunch costs 15 bolivianos ($2). There are special establishments that are open during lunch, and they have Almuerzo written on them, where they will serve a dish with soup, usually for 15 or 20 Bolivianos. As a rule, dishes look like: a piece of meat plus a lot of side dishes (rice, pasta, salad). In many places, the salad is served in a buffet format; you can choose it yourself.

Kebab houses are popular, serving pieces of meat and grilled sausages, costing 20-25 bolivianos, side dish included. Grill in Bolivia is very good.

There is no McDonald's in Bolivia; it is believed that it closed due to losses (although there may have been an attitude on the part of the authorities, who were anti-American under Evo Morales). At the same time, there are Burger King and KFC, as well as local fast food chains, which most often serve KFC-style chicken.
In more expensive establishments, dishes cost somewhere between 20-40 Bolivianos.

Glasses of freshly squeezed orange juice are often sold on the streets. Less commonly you can find batido - this is a beer with beaten egg and sugar.

As for shops, Bolivia is not a country where they are popular. Here everyone buys and sells on the market. In principle, there are supermarkets, but there are few of them, and the prices there are high, more expensive than in Russia or Brazil, since everything is basically imported. A large bottle of water in the supermarket costs almost a dollar.

Fruits in Bolivia are mostly familiar to us - oranges, apples, watermelons, bananas, papaya. Strawberries are often sold inexpensively on the streets. Of the unusual fruits, I tried tumbo (essentially a drier version of passion fruit) and tuna (Opuntia ficus-indica, an edible cactus that reminded me of pitaya in taste).

<b>Internet</b>
There are three operators in Bolivia: Entel, Tigo, Viva. The third one is rarely sold, and I have not tried it. Tigo you can buy a SIM card on every corner for 10 bolivianos. Entel is less common and costs 20-25 Bolivianos, but if you find an Entel office, it’s also 10 Bolivianos. Entel is better in all respects - it has better reception, and Internet packages are cheaper. They also give a 1 GB bonus when registering a SIM card and +3 GB for the first top up of 10 Bolivianos. Tigo also gives 3.5 GB, but only for three days, and not for a month, like Entel.
Registration is required, but you can do it yourself on the website or in the phone menu; instructions are included with the SIM card.
In general, the Internet was not very stable and often disconnected.

<b>Other</b>
The biggest problem in Bolivia is altitude sickness - a lack of oxygen in the blood due to low levels of oxygen in the thin air at high altitudes. It manifests itself in increased fatigue, nausea and headache, especially with a sharp rise (for example, if you fly straight to La Paz). I traveled by bus gradually from Santa Cruz (low altitude) to Sucre (2700 m), and then to Potosi (4000 m), where I was hit. Previously, I was at a maximum altitude of 3200 (<a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/528517.html">Nepal</a>, <a href="http://goo.gl/5GKiyN"> China</a>), and very briefly at 3500 (<a href="http://goo.gl/ZYifpt">Elbrus</a>, Teide), and altitude sickness appears somewhere around 3500. You need to get used to the altitude, not strain and relax, you can also take a Sorojche Pills tablet (sold in any pharmacy for 5 bolivianos) or chew coca leaves (cost pennies at the market).

It’s quite cold in the mountainous part of Bolivia, you need to sleep under a blanket all the time; I usually walked down the street in a sweater. Judging by climatograms, the temperature practically does not change throughout the year.
I can’t say anything bad about safety in Bolivia; I walked everywhere with a camera and wasn’t afraid (although perhaps this is purely a matter of perception of danger). Local residents don't like cameras and often turn away.

<b>By city</b>
Santa Cruz is the largest city and economic center and even has some international chains such as Starbucks. Lies on the plain.

Sucre is the official capital of Bolivia (in fact there is only the Constitutional Court) and a World Heritage Site

Coroico is a city at an altitude of only 1500, the road here from La Paz goes sharply down. The old road to Coroico was called the "road of death" due to the high number of accidents

La Paz is a fantastic city in a huge valley, with an altitude difference of almost a kilometer from 4000 to 3000, an enchanting network of cable cars on which you can fly over all these incredible landscapes. One of the most picturesque cities in the world.

<b>Total</b>
In 20 days I spent $880 for two people - $44 per day. I didn’t try to save money; if I had looked for hotels longer, I could have dropped below 40. Food was only $10 a day, because it’s cheap in Bolivia, and at high altitudes you want to eat less. The entire travel cost was $106, plus $83 for excursions (an excursion to the Uyuni salt marsh cost 200 Bolivianos, and 50 to Lake Titicaca). It cost $29 to travel around the city, most of it went to the La Paz cable car budget - I covered all the lines and all the stations.

In general, Bolivia is a fairly cheap country for travel, although not the cheapest in South America - at least Brazil is cheaper at the current exchange rate. In Bolivia, the price range is also small - I couldn’t squeeze the budget much, but there’s nowhere else to spend much more. It's funny that I watched the episode of "Heads and Tails" about Bolivia, where the presenter with a gold card went to Uyuni, spent a lot of money, but in essence her tour was the same as my regular tour for $30.
I really liked Bolivia - colorful, gorgeous landscapes, easy and comfortable travel. It was especially pleasant to get to a new country after almost a year without traveling outside of Russia.
