Exactly a month ago I <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/363261.html">left Russia for China</a> for free bread. It's time to sum up the first results and draw conclusions about this new format for me.
First, about the tourist part. <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/363948.html">The plan for March</a> was generally completed, although the route changed somewhat and became like this:

Now I'm in Xi'an, tomorrow I'm going to go further.
Day by day (more precisely, night) it turned out like this:
Heihe - 2 nights
Train Heihe-Harbin - 1 night
Harbin - 2 nights
Changchun - 1 night
Girin - 1 night
Shenyang - 2 nights
Dandong - 2 nights
Dalian - 2 nights
Tianjin - 2 nights
Beijing - 4 nights
Taishan - 3 nights
Qufu - 2 nights
Jinan - 1 night
Train Jinan-Hengshui-Pingyao - 1 night
Pingyao - 1 night
Train Pingyao-Xi'an - 1 night
Xi'an - 3 nights

Now the most interesting thing, about money. I estimated a budget of $30 a day for two, but as it turned out, such a budget is realistic if you save on everything. If you don't save, that's $40 a day. I'm not taking into account options like hitchhiking and couchsurfing here, because I'm not sure I could work with that type of travel.
$1 = 6.2 yuan. 1 yuan = 10 rubles. Here and below are graphs from the gnucash program, which I use for budgeting.

Most of the money was spent on travel. We traveled mainly by trains. In China there are high-speed trains and regular trains. There are two classes of high-speed ones, of which only the second is of interest (the first is very expensive and makes no sense). Regular trains have seats, reserved seats and compartments. There are simple and improved seats, but improved ones do not make sense, since they cost almost the same as a reserved seat. A coupe is twice as expensive as a reserved seat, so I didn’t consider that either.
At prices for the same distance, it is usually cheaper to take a seated regular train, then a reserved seat, and most expensive to take a high-speed train. If you have two weeks to travel around China, then there is a reason to take expressways so as not to waste time. I'm in no hurry, so I usually take the cheapest seat to travel during the day. For example, it was much more profitable to travel to Taishan during the day or evening, even for 7 hours, in a seated carriage than to take a reserved seat, even taking into account the savings on the hotel. In addition, reserved seats are cleared faster. So, from Heihe to Harbin two days before departure there were no reserved seat tickets, I had to travel overnight in a seated car, it was terrible, worse than taking a bus, but there wasn’t much choice.
Once we flew by plane, from Dalian to Tianjin; if you look at the map, it becomes clear why it is more convenient than by train. In terms of money, the plane was cheaper than a reserved seat (206 yuan with all taxes).
Buses in China are much more expensive than trains, almost twice as expensive. Buses have only one advantage: you don’t have to buy tickets for them in advance.
Transportation around the city is ridiculously cheap, $30 for the entire month. With the help of baidu maps, you can understand the routes of city buses, which saves money (the bus is cheaper than the metro) and time.
We used taxis twice: to get to Dalian airport in the morning (I was never able to find out where the buses were coming from), and to get from Taishan Mountain to the hotel in the evening (I no longer had the strength to walk).

We spent $333 on housing. The cheapest was in Harbin (40 yuan), the most expensive was in Shenyang (100).

When I was in China last time, the price of 200 yuan per room seemed ridiculous to me: in Russia you can’t always find rooms for 1000 rubles. Now I have lowered the bar to 100. The general conclusion is this: for 80-100 yuan you can rent a <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/365781.html">chic</a> (by Russian or European standards) number, but you will have to spend some effort to find it. For 130-150 you can find it without bothering or haggling at all. The cheapest housing can be rented for 50-60 yuan, but the comfort there will not be very good.
In general, housing starts at a ridiculous 20 yuan per room, but renting for that price is almost impossible for a foreigner. The fact is that in 99% of cheap hotels they will immediately wave their hand at you: “We do not accommodate foreigners.” I tried to find out the reasons on the Internet. Apparently, 10 years ago, foreigners could really only live in reputable hotels of 4 stars or more. Then this restriction was lifted, now you can even couchsurf. In theory, the hotel must register the guest with the local migration service (if you are staying as a guest, you need to go there yourself), and it seems that the administrators of cheap hotels simply do not want to deal with this. However, sometimes it is possible to check into a cheap hotel informally. According to my observations, in small cities such as Jilin or Tai'an, this is easier, although there are exceptions, for example, Dandong. The worst thing was in Beijing; we probably visited at least 30 hotels, and all without success.
Cheap hotels in China are comparable in level of comfort to cheap hotels in Russia or Latin America, more or less shabby rooms in the "scoop" style. It’s interesting that even the cheapest and most miserable hotel has rubber slippers and Wi-Fi. Most also have a kettle, and for some reason many have a computer instead of a TV.

During this month I never booked a hotel in advance. The search algorithm is something like this. You leave the station and walk around the streets, preferably not avenues, but side streets. Regular trains arrive at central stations, which are close to the city center (as opposed to high-speed train stations, which are often located on the outskirts), so the area around the station is logistically convenient. Reservation systems like booking and agoda rarely give really good deals. I mastered the baidu maps application on my phone, it can search for hotels around the current location and sort by price. If the price on baidu looks good, at the reception I simply show the page on my phone, asking if such numbers are available. If I enter a hotel from the street, I simply ask how much the room costs, I can haggle a little and knock down 10-20 yuan.
The only place where this algorithm did not work was Beijing. They don't offer accommodation in cheap hotels there as a matter of principle. However, fortunately on agoda.com there was a very favorable offer from one hotel, which was even within walking distance from the central square - 85 yuan per day. At the counter they asked me for 100, to which I reasonably noted that then I could stupidly book from my phone for today for 85. After some misunderstanding, I rented a room for only 79, i.e. 85 minus site commission!

Food is very interesting. In China, you can eat for two on $12 a day, if you don’t deny yourself anything. If you are an adherent of proper nutrition and do not buy sweets and snacks, then you can keep it under 8 dollars.

An approximate price breakdown is as follows. Any small street is lined with eateries. The price level is approximately the same. A meat dish costs 20-30 yuan. Noodles and soups - 5-10 yuan: if there is no meat, then 5 (some soups even have 3), if there is meat, then 8-10. Vegetable dishes are usually also around 10. Chinese dumplings - about half a yuan each, served in portions of 8-10 pieces. The menu, of course, is only in Chinese. Baidu translate can translate well, often even uploading a photo of the dish. In some places there are photographs of dishes on the walls, as a rule, there are only photographs of more expensive dishes, cheap ones only on the menu.

I have never been to McDuck, KFC or other establishments with cuisine that is exotic by local standards.
I can talk endlessly about Chinese food; someday I will write a megapost on this topic in several parts.
This time I divided the “other expenses” column into two, highlighting “entertainment” as a separate category; in fact, for now there are only entrance tickets to all sorts of attractions. As you know, attractions in China are expensive, so reasonable savings are needed here. You can get into most places for half price by calling yourself a student, while some only accept Chinese students, while others accept a Russian student card or something similar.
Where we were:
Changchun Japanese Occupation Museum - free
Shenyang, Forbidden City - 60 yuan
Dandong, Great Wall of China - 60 yuan (good site, no people at all)
Beijing, Forbidden City - 20 yuan for student
Beijing Zoo - 5 yuan for students, another 5 for entry to the pandas.
Beijing Summer Palace - 20 yuan
Beijing, Temple of Heaven - 10 yuan for entering the park, another 20 for entering the temple itself
Beijing, park opposite the Forbidden City - 2 yuan
Beijing Art Museum - free
Mount Taishan - climbed for free through the forest. It turned out very cool, more fun than walking up the steps for five kilometers. In general, the entrance fee is 125 yuan, another 30 yuan one way for a bus to the middle of the mountain, and 100 yuan one way (!) for a cable car to the top. The entire path can be walked, it is about 7-8 kilometers along the steps.
Qufu, Confucius Temple - 90 yuan, Confucius Cemetery - 40 yuan.
Jinan, park with springs - 5 yuan, students 2.5.
Pingyao - one ticket for the whole city costs 150 yuan, we took one student ticket for 75, and took turns, since different houses are quite similar. The most impressive thing is the walk along the city wall. In principle, at unpopular exits you can step over the turnstile.
Xi'an, Terracotta Army - 150 yuan. Two tickets accounted for 40% of the month's entertainment costs. There are no discounts for foreign students, although I read that someone still managed to get a ticket at half the Russian student price.

Among other expenses, the most was spent on the Internet: I bought a 3G SIM card for $48 (300 yuan) from China Unicom. 3 gigabytes for six months (+ another 9 gigabytes in the province where the card was purchased, they remained in Harbin). I need stable internet for work, although so far in many cases I have been satisfied with hotel Wi-fi. I used up 600 megabytes in a month, and for the last 10 days I haven’t really tried to save traffic. The rest of the little things: napkins, soap, washing powder, brush, knife, glue, belt, shoes - in total they will cost about 13 dollars.

All expenses for the month amounted to about $1200. During this time I earned more, so from a financial point of view at the moment I am in the black. In principle, you can squeeze 40 hours a week out of yourself at this pace, but so far there has been no serious need for this, I even sometimes spent time writing posts on LiveJournal. True, training in new technologies is still going rather poorly, since priority is given to current work and scientific tasks, as well as to learning Chinese.

And finally, five juicy places in a month.
Harbin.

Here on the left is China, and on the right is North Korea, well, you know what I mean.

Tianjin is the coolest city, for some reason ignored.
<img src="images/guide-china2-24501409198_73886bec8b_o.jpg">
Mount Taishan, or rather, the mountains near it.
<img src="images/guide-china2-24501409378_b6e58f3f64_o.jpg">
Pingyao is the most colorful city in China so far. Most importantly, almost the entire old city is residential, not tourist.
