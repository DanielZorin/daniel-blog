Germany is the largest country in Europe in terms of population and economy, and, of course, one of the most popular, both for tourism and for emigration.

<b>Transport</b>
Germany is a country of trains. Trains are everywhere and run regularly and frequently. The website of the German railways <a href="https://bahn.de/">bahn.de</a> allows you to look at timetables not only in Germany, but throughout Europe, which I have used several times, especially when I needed to check train schedules between different countries.
In Germany, all trains can be globally divided into high-speed and local. High-speed ones go over long distances between several regions (or somewhere abroad), and local ones go within one region or to a neighboring one. High-speed trains have codes IC, ICE, local ones - RE, RB or S. The interface has a very important checkbox “Nur Nahverkehr”, by checking which you can search only for local trains. You can even build a route from Warsaw to Seville on local trains with 31 transfers.
Pricing for high-speed trains is absolutely random, much more random than for airplanes. Literally, the price of trains running half an hour apart can differ by two or more times. Here is a vivid example (these are prices three days after the date when I am writing this).
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945966511_51b88897f6_h.jpg"/>
If you look at tomorrow, all tickets in this direction cost 40-50 euros. And after a month everything costs 18-20 euros.
Interestingly, in Germany, seats on high-speed trains are not fixed; you can reserve them for a fee. Otherwise, theoretically, you risk riding standing. I have never seen anything like this on high-speed railways in any other country in the world. There are no seat reservations on local trains at all.
Since almost all my travels in Germany have been concentrated in one or two regions, I only took the high-speed train for the first time this year. And so I always traveled on local trains. They usually go every hour at the same time.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946304594_71c10ea275_h.jpg"/>
A local train from Munich to Nuremberg costs 24 euros. For 2 hours of travel it seems normal, but the shorter the trip, the more expensive it turns out. For example, from Erfurt to Weimar costs 6.80, and it is only 15 minutes.
But in general, I almost never bought such single tickets either. Because in Germany travel passes rule. The passes are valid only on local trains, the following are available:
- Länder-Ticket - a pass for the whole day in one region. Each region has them, sometimes including individual cities or territories in neighboring regions (for example, a ticket for Schleswig-Holstein also includes the city of Hamburg). The more people, the cheaper. For example, a ticket in Bavaria costs 27 euros for one, 36 euros for two, 45 euros for three. It turns out that instead of buying a one-way ticket to Nuremberg for 24 euros, you can buy a day pass for 27 euros and get there and back, or visit another city along the way. Or two. Or three. The routes are becoming more intricate...
- Quer-durchs-Land-Ticket - a whole-day travel pass throughout Germany! This is if you still need to move further away to a neighboring region. Costs 44 euros for one, 51 for two, and then +7 for each. Cheaper than any two regional passes.
- In 2023, an even more epic thing appeared: the Deutschland Ticket. This is a pass for all local trains throughout the country for a whole month! And it costs only 49 euros. It was originally intended for those who live in Germany (apparently, to motivate someone to switch from a car to a train, because the price is very enticingly low). But in principle, nothing prevents you from buying it, even if you are a tourist, except for one pitfall - you need to plan in advance. This ticket is not really a ticket, but rather a subscription (like Netflix), which is charged on the 10th of each month for the <i>next</i> month. That is, if you plan to visit Germany, say, in September, you must subscribe no later than August 10, and then unsubscribe no later than September 10.

In addition to trains, I also traveled by buses. Buses were banned for a long time, but in 2013-2014 they were allowed, and that’s when the FlixBus company gained popularity. In principle, if you need to travel a long distance (between regions), and do not want to make many stops along the way, then the bus is much cheaper than the train (though now probably almost any trip longer than 3-4 days will be cheaper with a Deutschland ticket, if you can buy it). The trip from Munich to Nuremberg discussed above costs by bus from 8 euros in advance to 13-15 euros tomorrow.
Traveling around the city in Germany can be paid either with single tickets or by taking a day ticket. Large cities are divided into zones; the more zones you pass through, the more expensive it is. A single ticket is usually valid for 60-120 minutes and allows transfers, but you can only move in one direction, not back and forth. Typically, a one-day ticket costs less than three single-entry tickets. A single ticket in Berlin costs 3 euros, a day ticket costs 8.80 (in central areas). In Munich, a single ticket is already 3.70; in 10 years the price has risen by about a euro.

<b>Food</b>
Germany is not famous for its cooking, although the sausages there are still excellent. Restaurants in Germany are quite expensive. Here is an ordinary restaurant in a not particularly touristy city, dishes and burgers from 15 euros.

There is an Italian restaurant nearby, also more expensive than a similar one in Italy.

I reviewed prices in supermarkets in detail <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/534835.html">here</a>. Though, that trip took place in 2018. Since then, prices have increased one and a half to two times: for example, minced meat cost 2.79, now it is 4.29.

<b>Accomodation</b>
Germany is quite an expensive country in terms of housing. A hotel room costs from 40 euros. In my experience, Airbnb in Germany doesn’t work very well, it’s never cheaper than a hotel, so I almost always stayed in hotels.

<b>What to see</b>
Germany consists of 16 regions ("federal states"), three of which are cities. There is still a noticeable difference between the eastern regions, which were under Soviet occupation, and the western ones. There is clearly less tourism in the east, with the exception of Berlin.
Almost all the big cities in Germany were heavily destroyed during the Second World War, so for the medieval atmosphere you need to go to small towns, of which there are many throughout the country.
There are as many as 51 UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Germany (hereinafter UWH for short), of which I visited 20. There are entire cities, and individual cathedrals, museums, and architectural monuments of the 20th century.
I have been to 13 regions out of 16.
<b>Berlin</b> is the capital. Brandenburg Gate, museums, Berlin Wall.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946229243_b472a77fba_h.jpg"/>
<b>Brandenburg</b> - around Berlin. I have only been to the two cities closest to Berlin: Potsdam - home of the Palace of the Prussian Kings (UWH).

Regions where I have not been:
<b>Saar</b> is a small region on the border with France. Notable only for its history, there were many coal mines there, which is why after the First World War it was under French occupation for a long time.
<b>Mecklenburg - Vorpommern</b> - the coast of the Baltic Sea. Here are the historical cities of Rostock, Wismar and Stralsund.
<b>Saxony-Anhalt</b> is a rather interesting eastern region. Important cities: Magdeburg, Halle, Quedlinburg, Wittenberg
