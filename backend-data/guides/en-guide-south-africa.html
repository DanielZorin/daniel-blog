Africa! Can’t say that I’ve been dreaming of going there for a long time, because if I had, I would probably have gone earlier, and not after visiting 149 other countries on other continents. And you know, I think I did the right thing. I think if I had gone there unprepared, not hardened by India and Brazil, my impressions might have been rather negative. But now I was mentally prepared, and everything turned out to be not so scary, but overall very cool.
I started with the Republic of South Africa - probably the most developed and popular country for tourism in Africa.

<b>Basics</b>
The currency of South Africa is called the rand, code ZAR. $1 = 19 ZAR. Banknotes 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 rand (maximum $10), coins 1, 2, 5 rand, and pennies 0.10, 0.25, 0.50. At an ATM at the Johannesburg airport, I was able to withdraw 10,000 rand (~$500) at once, which was enough for the entire trip (I also exchanged rands in neighboring countries for local currencies).

There are sometimes places in South Africa where you cannot pay in cash: for example, to enter the Cape of Good Hope National Park or to see the penguins in Simon's Town. Sometimes I saw signs on restaurants that only cards were accepted for payment.
The outlets in South Africa are unique and local. Looking at the diagrams on the Internet, I used to always think that these sockets are no different from European ones, since there are also two round holes, and a third one on top for grounding. But it turned out that the distance between the pins is wider, so European plugs cannot be inserted into a socket in South Africa. On the very first day I bought an adapter at the market. In many places there are double sockets, on one side there is a South African socket, on the other there is a European one, but narrow, like in Brazil (you can’t insert a round laptop plug).

<b>Accomodation</b>
A hotel room in South Africa costs about $25 on average. The quality of the hotels for the money is high - there were air conditioners, refrigerators, hot water, and decent decoration everywhere. Only in Cape Town is housing more expensive, I also paid 25 there, but that was with a shared shower. Back in the non-tourist town of Emalahleni, it turned out that my hotel was in the middle of the red light district (although visually this is an ordinary residential area, like in America, but there were girls standing near every second house). The hotel there was also of so-so quality.

In South Africa there is such a problem as rolling blackouts (load shedding). They turn off electricity about two times for two hours a day, you can download the application to find out the schedule for a specific city. Somehow it happened that I only noticed blackouts in Cape Town - there it was in the evening, when I was just at the hotel, and my lights went out. In other cities, either there were generators, or the outages were at night or in the morning/day when I was outside.

<b>Transport</b>
It is wise to travel long distances by plane. There are three airlines in South Africa: the expensive South African Airways, the regular Airlink and the low-cost FlySafair. The low-cost airline does not include free luggage (but the carry on size limit is large, as it used to be in Europe), and the boarding pass is sent after online check-in on Whatsapp. Airlink is not a low-cost airline, they even give out food. Prices for domestic flights are about 30-70 dollars, for me it wasn’t super cheap because I bought it 1-2 weeks before departure. Flights mainly connect through Johannesburg, but there are also flights between other cities, for example Cape Town-Durban and Durban-Port Elizabeth, but not very often.

South Africa has a long-distance train system, which, however, was greatly reduced after the covid pandemic (a lot of things here have been closed since then and have not returned). Previously, it was possible from Johannesburg to get to Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth, and Maputo in Mozambique, and there is a branch to the north through Botswana, Zimbabwe and Zambia all the way to Tanzania.
Full-length buses run only over long distances - from Cape Town to Port Elizabeth, for example, or even to Namibia. The largest company is Intercape, there is also Greyhound, familiar from the USA, and some others. But in general there are not many of them. For example, from Botswana to Johannesburg there is only an Intercape bus that runs once a day. From Rustenburg (the largest city in the northwest) to Pretoria (the capital) there is only one (!) bus per day, it seems to be the same one that starts from Botswana.
There is also a tourist bus company called BazBus in South Africa. They used to run all along the south coast from Cape Town to Durban, and from Durban to Johannesburg. However, at the end of 2023, the route network was sharply reduced, and is now only from Cape Town to Port Elizabeth via the Garden Route. A ticket there costs $200, and you can get off in cities along the way and continue on the next day. I think it’s a little expensive for such a route (a ticket for a regular bus costs 30-40 dollars, with a lot of stops it’s certainly more expensive, but not five times). But there is a schedule, reliability.
For medium and short distances, public transport is minibuses. In the north of the country I rode them, for lack of an alternative. Everything is as usual, you come to the bus station, there are a bunch of minibuses in different directions, you wait for it to fill up and go. Costs approximately 100 rand / $5 per hour. I went Gaborone - Rustenburg - Pretoria, then Eswatini - Emalahleni - Pretoria.
White South Africans do not ride minibuses, so their routes are not always obvious. I realized this when I was trying to get from Cape Town to the neighboring town of Stellenbosch (such a tourist destination). It turned out that the minibus from the center of Cape Town to Stellenbosch takes about two hours to fill up. But minibuses from Stellenbosch constantly went to the “black” areas on the outskirts of Cape Town. Based on this, I suspect that traveling through the whitest part of South Africa from Cape Town to Port Elizabeth on public transport can be quite a chore, and BazBus may be a good alternative. In the north, where mostly blacks live, it seems to me that there is no problem; everywhere there should be frequent traffic on the main roads.

It's funny that in wikivoyage, in the "Get in" section about the cities and parks of South Africa, there is usually no mention of public transport at all, it only says which route to take by car. Car rental here is quite developed, as in the USA - a tourist can rent without any problems. The price is about 40-60 dollars per day, there are cars with a manual transmission that are cheaper. In South Africa you drive on the left, so you probably won't want to drive a manual. The roads are good everywhere. Petrol costs about 24 rand per liter ($1.20).
I only rented a car for one day to go to Pilanesberg National Park. It’s worth dwelling on this in a little more detail: in South Africa, you can drive around many parks and reserves in your own or rented car, which is generally not typical for African countries. Usually you can only go on a safari in a special jeep with a guide, and such options are also available here. But if you have already rented a car to get to the park (otherwise you won’t be able to get there unless you hitchhike), then why not drive yourself? This makes it more exciting to track down animals, although driving around on dirt roads all day is quite tiring. But if you rent a car not for a day, as I did, but for longer, then it makes sense to come to the park early in the morning or in the evening before sunset, because at this time the chances of meeting animals are the best.

Inside the cities public transport is quite sad. Since all the rich people only travel by car, buses here belong to the world of the poor, which is in stark contrast to the world of the rich (and almost does not overlap). In Cape Town, buses on many routes run every 30 minutes, or even less frequent; traveling by bus is extremely inefficient. Buses to the airport stopped running altogether due to Covid. Suburban trains in Cape Town have also been significantly shortened, so you can no longer get to Stellenbosch or Simon's Town.

Johannesburg has the only public transport for whites in South Africa - the Gautrain, connecting the center of Johannesburg, the wealthy Sandton area, the airport and the city of Pretoria. This train and its stations even visually contrast with the literally neighboring stations of regular commuter trains and buses. A ticket from Johannesburg to Pretoria costs R82, probably cheaper by minibus, but the train is fast and comfortable (every 15 minutes). A ticket to the airport is disproportionately expensive - 206 rand; for the same money or even a little cheaper you can get to Sandton by taxi.

I almost always traveled by taxi, including for safety reasons, since the cities of South Africa are in the world top in terms of crime levels, on a par with the cities of Brazil and Central America. There are three apps: Uber, Bolt and inDrive. inDrive is usually cheaper, and the other two, depending on your luck, one or the other may be cheaper. Uber usually has the longest wait. Taxi is quite inexpensive; for short distances the trip costs 2-3 dollars. It's about 8-10 to the airport in Cape Town, Durban, or Johannesburg.


<b>Food</b>
In terms of cuisine, South Africa is not the most interesting place. There is good old barbecue (called braai), a typically local sticky corn porridge (pap) served as a side dish. They also love sausages, such as boerewors, and there are also pork sausages called Russians (possibly brought by migrants from the Russian Empire). And there is also a thing called Potjiekos, which is essentially a stir-fry of different vegetables or meats; restaurants have a special section with different types.
And in South Africa there are good and cheap steaks, you can eat a steak for 10 dollars. I used this all the time.

In general, prices in restaurants are more than acceptable, for example:
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946225118_470aa0285c_o.jpg" title=""/>
And even this restaurant right near the Cape of Good Hope, such a tourist place without competition, and at the same time the prices are modest:
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946300334_fe8fbe299b_o.jpg" title=""/>
In popular places you can eat some kind of shawarma or chicken for 3 or even 2 dollars.

Supermarkets in South Africa are available and popular, which is more typical for rich countries (in poor countries they sell goods at the market). There will be a separate review of the supermarket later. There is the expensive Woolworths chain for the elite, and the regular Pick'n'pay. There are also stores from the familiar Spar chain. The stores have a good selection of goods, especially meat (if you want to cook). South Africa also has a decent selection of cheeses, including locally produced cheeses such as Camembert and Brie, and their prices are comparable to those in France.

<b>Internet</b>
I overpaid for the Internet because I arrived on the weekend and couldn’t get into the operator’s office. So I bought a SIM card from a stall in a park in Cape Town, it cost me R300, including about 10GB of data. It would be even more expensive to buy at the airport, but in general a 7GB package from this operator should cost 100 rand, and then the SIM card itself costs something, but probably not 200. I don’t recommend the Telkom operator, because it worked glitchy - there are two Telkom networks: Telkom and Telkom-4G, and it kept switching to the second one, and the Internet did not work on it, I had to manually select the first one all the time. When you’re just walking, it’s still fine, but if you’re traveling by transport, you constantly have to switch to another network.

<b>What to see</b>
South Africa consists of 9 provinces, of which I have only been to 5 so far.
<b>Western Cape Province</b> - here is Cape Town, the richest and most touristy city in South Africa, and probably in all of Africa. The city is very contrasting. The rich areas and much of the city center look like a first world country, on par with Australia or the USA. And also, here are the most terrible poor slums that I have seen in all of South Africa, from a distance at least they look worse than in Johannesburg.

Cape of Good Hope National Park is located near Cape Town.

<b>Eastern Cape</b> is also a popular tourist destination. Between Cape Town and Port Elizabeth is the Garden Route National Park and many cute little towns and beaches. The coast further east from Port Elizabeth towards Durban is much less visited.
<b>Northern Cape</b> is the most deserted province. In the main town of Kimberley you can see the quarry where diamonds are mined. Behind it begins the Kalahari Desert, which also covers parts of Namibia and Botswana.
<b>KwaZulu-Natal</b> is a region where the Zulu language is spoken. The largest city, Durban, is a local beach resort on the shores of the Indian Ocean. The city turned out to be quite pleasant. North of Durban are the Drakensberg Mountains, a beautiful place to reach by car.

<b>Free State</b> - former Orange Republic of the Boers. The main city is Bloemfontein. From here you can travel to Lesotho.
<b>North West</b> is a region along the border with Botswana. The largest city is called Rustenburg. The town is not very interesting, I used it as a base to rent a car and go to Pilanesberg National Park.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945962581_bc3e8e26c8_o.jpg" title=""/>
But the park is very interesting, you can see all sorts of animals there, including the big five: lions, leopards, elephants, rhinoceroses, buffalos. Unfortunately, I didn’t see any lions or leopards, but I did see a lot of elephants, and I also saw other animals.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945062782_0c05b35245_o.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Gauteng</b> is the smallest and most populous province. The capital of South Africa, Pretoria, is located here. The president and government sit in Pretoria. Cape Town, where the parliament is located, and Bloemfontein, where the supreme court is located, are also considered capitals.

Johannesburg is also located here - it's the economic center and main airport. The city has a very bad reputation, and the center is really creepy, much like the worst cities in Brazil. The locals are very careful. To the north of the center is the wealthy Sandton area, which did not seem dangerous to me, although the houses are still heavily guarded. I did not go into the slums, being satisfied with the views of them from afar.

<b>Limpopo</b> is a northern province with nothing particularly interesting except the northern half of the Kruger National Park.
<b>Mpumalanga</b> is a large province between Johannesburg and the borders with Eswatini and Mozambique. I went through it on the way from Eswatini, stopping overnight in the town of Emalahleni, which turned out to be quite creepy. The main city of this region is Mbombela (aka Nelspruit), not far from it along the border with Mozambique is the Kruger National Park - probably the largest and most popular park in South Africa. All the main animals are there and the chances of meeting them are high, judging by the stories - higher than in Pilanesberg. And the roads inside there seem to be better. So the park is worth a visit, although it is far from everything.
