Usually people come to Hong Kong for two or three days, but I decided to relax and stay for 10 days. Is there enough to do in Hong Kong with that much time?
I was in Hong Kong before in 2013, so I didn’t go to some places where I was back then: <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/295687.html">first part</a>, <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/296023.html">second part</a>

<b>Money</b>
One Hong Kong dollar (HKD) is 20% less than the yuan. 1 USD = 7.8 HKD. The best rate is at Chungking mansions, the rate at the airport is very bad.
You can withdraw decent amounts from ATMs, at least 6,000 HKD at a time.

<b>Accomodation</b>
It makes the most sense to live in Chungking mansions (unless you are a millionaire, of course). There are hundreds of small hotels in this building, high competition forces them to maintain a decent quality of rooms: you can easily find a room with a fresh renovation, air conditioning, shower and toilet in the room. Sometimes with a cyberpunk-style view from the window. It’s a bit cramped, of course, but everywhere in Hong Kong it’s a bit cramped, even for $100.

For some reason, they write everywhere that housing is expensive in Hong Kong, almost like in London, but this is complete nonsense. A private double room at Chungking mansions costs 160 HKD, or $20. Many times cheaper than in London, especially considering that you live in the very center of Hong Kong. On weekends, prices rise one and a half times; you won’t find anything cheaper than $30, but you can cheat and check in on Wednesday or Thursday, paying the weekday price for the weekend. But in neighboring Macau, hotel prices are really prohibitive, there is nothing cheaper than $60 on a weekday and $90 on a weekend, so it’s better to day trip to Macau from Hong Kong.

In principle, it is not necessary to book in advance, especially on weekdays; on the ground floor you will always be offered somewhere to stay.

<b>Transport</b>
It is more convenient to use the Octopus card, although it does not give a discount (unlike T-money cards in South Korea). The only good thing is that you don’t need to worry about having small change, because... They don’t give change on buses, and the price may not be round, for example 9.80 HKD. I also didn’t find any discounts for transferring from the metro to the bus using the Octopus card. So it’s unlikely that you’ll be able to recoup the 9 HKD that Octopus costs (they initially take a deposit of 50 HKD and return 41 HKD + the balance on the card), but it’s only one US dollar, so it’s not very scary.
Travel in Hong Kong is not very cheap. One stop on the metro will cost more than 4 HKD, and one stop between Hong Kong Island and the mainland will cost around 12 HKD. Ground transport is cheaper: from 3.50 by bus and 2.30 by double-decker tram. Getting to the airport costs 20 HKD: from Chungking mansions by metro to Tung Chung for 16.50, then by bus for 3.50. A direct bus will cost twice as much, and a direct train will generally cost around 90-100 HKD.
The best way to get to Hong Kong Island is by Star Ferry; it costs 2 HKD, six times cheaper than the metro. The ferry to Lamma Island costs 17 HKD from the center and 12 HKD from the Aberdeen area on the opposite side of the island. The ferry to Lantau will be about the same. On Saturday and Sunday, prices for all ferries rise by 50%, so it is better to plan trips to distant islands on weekdays.
If you're in Hong Kong for a short period of time, it might be worth getting a MRT pass for HKD 55, which is valid for 24 hours. It will pay off if you go to the outskirts twice. But you still have to pay separately for buses.
In just 10 days, travel costs were 184 HKD ($23). Like that:
Ferry to Lamma Island, back to Aberdeen and bus to the center - about 35 HKD
Metro to Tung Chung, bus from the metro to the Buddha statue (yes, it's much cheaper and faster than the cable car), then back to the Mui Wo ferry - 55 HKD
Travel from the airport and back - 40 HKD
Bus to Victoria Peak - 10 HKD, walk down
The rest was spent on small trips by metro, Star Ferry, etc.

<b>Food</b>
The food is expensive by Chinese standards (and by Taiwanese standards too). Regular noodle dishes cost from 25 HKD; if you look hard enough, you can find them cheaper (for about 17), but this is rare. Larger dishes cost 40 HKD. There is no Chinese fast food like skewers in Hong Kong, because sidewalk sales are prohibited.

The stores are also not particularly cheap; fruits are mostly expensive. Apples cost 4 HKD each, but sometimes in the evening you can find them discounted for 1 HKD. Pitaya costs a little less than apples.
The cheapest way to eat, oddly enough, is McDonald's: a menu with a double cheeseburger costs 22 HKD, and for another 4 HKD you can get a large portion of potatoes and cola instead of the standard one. All other menus cost much more, around 35-40 HKD.

<b>Shopping</b>
In Hong Kong, equipment is quite cheap, although specifically now in Russia it is cheaper because prices have not yet caught up with the dollar. But it’s realistic to buy a DSLR or laptop for $250. In Taiwan, prices were 30 percent higher.
But with the accompanying accessories everything is not so good. I wanted to buy a new battery for the laptop (so that it would work longer), so they charged me as much as 800 HKD, while in Shanghai it cost 100 yuan (7 times less). I really regretted that I didn’t buy it in Shanghai then.
Chinese rich people come to Hong Kong to shop, so there are jewelry stores at every turn, there are several chain stores that are no less common than 7 eleven. Near Chungking mansions you can buy cheap watches from Indians, if you’re interested.

<b>Internet</b>
Since long trips by transport were not planned, I did not buy a SIM card in Hong Kong, limiting myself to fast Wi-Fi in the hotel. Wi-fi is not difficult to find in public places, although it is almost always only once a day for 20-30 minutes. You need to connect to a network called "Wi-fi HK via <something>".
The SIM card from China did not work in Hong Kong, it did not even connect to the network.

<b>Entertainment</b>
Hong Kong is nice because it is close to wild nature like no other metropolis. Half an hour on the ferry and you’re on a sparsely populated island where you can go hiking in the mountains. In general, this time I was really lazy in Hong Kong, solving various everyday and work issues, on some days I didn’t even really go far from Chungking mansions. Last time in three days I saw not much less than this time in 10.

In Hong Kong you can relax on the beach. There is a beach near the subway terminus on Hong Kong Island, but I didn’t get there. But I was on the beach on Lamma Island overlooking the power plant and on the beach on Lantau Island. The beaches are sandy, comfortable, there are changing rooms and showers (hello to the Philippines!). The water is cloudy, you can’t really see anything underwater.

I climbed onto the roof of the Chungking mansion, however, after five minutes I was kicked out of there, but I managed to take a couple of dozen photographs.


<b>Conclusion</b>
Total expenses for 10 days and 9 nights were $436, $48 per day.

The hotel cost almost half.

Hong Kong is an expensive city by Asian standards, but by European standards it is cheap, on par with Budapest. The perfect combination of city and nature makes it a great place even for a long stay, not just for transit.
