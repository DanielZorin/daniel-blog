I spent 15 days in late December and early January in Siberia and Mongolia, traveling more than 5,000 kilometers. Everything turned out to be not as scary as one might think. The main result: traveling around Russia in winter is possible and great. This is no less interesting than in the summer, and in some ways even more convenient.
Now, as usual, point by point.

<b>Equipment and fighting the cold</b>
A common stereotype is that it is always -40 in Siberia. For Moscow residents this sounds scary, because in Moscow even -20 happens once every ten years. In fact, if you look at the weather statistics for the year, you can see that -20 in Siberia (in large cities, which are still not in the Arctic Circle) does not happen every day, but usually several days a month, the rest of the time it's 0 to -10. This is approximately how it turned out in practice. It turned out that even at -20, you can walk along the streets or through the forest without problems if you dress correctly. It becomes very cold and uncomfortable from -25, then you need to constantly run somewhere to warm up.
For a winter trip, I slightly expanded the standard luggage with additional clothing. My basic equipment was as follows. On top there are four layers of insulation: a T-shirt, a sweatshirt, a leather vest and a jacket. I didn't have a fur jacket or fur coat, so I ended up with two layers over the sweatshirt. However, at temperatures not lower than -10, I could walk without a vest. Below are underpants and insulated pants, similar to what skiers and snowboarders use. The warmest footwear I had were boots; they are susceptible to getting wet, but it’s okay to walk in the snow. I chose thicker socks. I bought insulated gloves for skiers. Finally, I put a balaclava on my head - the most cold-sensitive part of the body - and a regular hat on top. In extreme frosts, a balaclava can be pulled over your mouth or even over your nose, however, after a while it fogs up, which is not very pleasant. Also, if you pull a balaclava over your nose, your breath will make your glasses sweat.
You can take photographs in the cold, my camera never failed. The main thing is to get used to operating the camera while wearing gloves. You also need to remember to cover the lens with a cover, otherwise when you enter the room it will fog up, and in the most severe cases it may fog up on the inside, then you will have to wait a long time for it to thaw.



<b>Russia - transport</b>
Based on the results of this trip, I can say that I traveled most of the Trans-Siberian Railway. Previously, I was only on the two extreme sections Moscow-Perm and Birobidzhan-Vladivostok, now I have traveled most of the middle, from Yekaterinburg to Ulan-Ude (except for the 100 km section Irkutsk-Slyudyanka), this is about 60 hours on the road. In total, the trains cost about 5,500 rubles (in third class, of course), inexpensive.

<b>Russia - accomodation</b>
In all cities (Yekaterinburg, Krasnoyarsk, Irkutsk, Ulan-Ude) I had no problems finding decent hotels no more than 1000 rubles for a double room. The best was in Irkutsk ("Good Cat"), in the rest the rooms were not so bright and shiny.

<b>Russia - attractions</b>
In <b>Yekaterinburg</b> we never got to the observation deck, because on December 31 it was closed. The city itself is pleasant and lively.
In <b>Tyumen</b> the main feature is hot springs, just like in Budapest. The easiest way to get to the Yar springs is by minibuses from the city center. In addition, this is the cheapest one - entrance is 190 rubles. For comparison, the entrance to the next closest spring in the city costs more than 1,000 rubles. The pool is open, so when it’s -27 outside, the feeling is indescribable. After a few minutes, your hair becomes covered with frost, so you need to dive under water all the time.
In <b>Omsk</b>, in addition to the city center, we went to visit the grave of Yegor Letov, at the Staro-Vostochny cemetery to the left of the main alley, next to one of the perpendicular alleys.
In <b>Krasnoyarsk</b> the main attraction is the Stolby Nature Reserve. There are two ways to get there. You can get to the main entrance by bus, from there you need to walk another 7 kilometers to the first pillars themselves (and then the same amount back). This is somewhat scary, but there is another way: you can go to the Bobrovy Log ski park, and there take the chairlift to the top (250 rubles). From the top you can already clearly see one of the pillars ("Takmak"), and others can be seen further away. And from there you can walk to the central pillars, 3-4 kilometers (40-50 minutes, if you don’t stop). It's difficult to get lost in the park; there are signs everywhere. In my opinion, it’s better to visit this park in winter than at other times of the year, because a) there are no mosquitoes and other midges b) unlike the rain, in which walking through the forest is unpleasant, to put it mildly, the snow doesn’t really bother you if it’s not hellish blizzard
In <b>Irkutsk</b>, of course, the main thing is Baikal. You can get to the village of Listvyanka for 120 rubles by minibus. On Baikal you can drink water directly from the lake and eat fish: omul - from 100 rubles, grayling - from 150 (depending on size). The city of Slyudyanka (160 rubles by minibus from Irkutsk) turned out to be a terrible place: the embankment is broken, it’s difficult to walk the streets, there are no cafes or restaurants, I had to sit there for five hours at the station waiting for the train. Though, from the city the road rises into the mountains along a serpentine road, from there there is an excellent view.
<b>Ulan-Ude</b>, being the capital of the national republic, has its own flavor; restaurants serve Buryat cuisine, for example, buuzy (similar to dumplings or khinkali) and khushuur (pies with meat). We went to the Ivolginsky Datsan - the main Buddhist monastery in Russia (travel on two minibuses - 60 rubles one way).
<b>Kyakhta</b> is considered one of the ~40 <a href="">historical cities of Russia</a>, of all the ones I have seen, it is the least impressive. Here is the border with Mongolia.

<b>Mongolia</b>
The currency of Mongolia is called tugrik, $1 = 1900 tugriks, 1 ruble was approximately 35 tugriks. Prices in Mongolia used to be low, but now they are high for us. A significant part of the goods in the stores are Russian (even the labels in Russian have not been replaced), the price in tugriks corresponded to the price in rubles before the exchange rate collapse, but now it turns out that food in Mongolian stores is twice as expensive as in Russian ones.
There are problems with communication, almost no one speaks Russian or English, sometimes there are only people of the older generation who understand Russian, the closer to the border, the more.
Russian citizens have not needed a visa since November last year. You can only cross the border in Kyakhta by car. It's slow and tedious. Drivers charge 150 rubles for crossing the border as a passenger. From the border the nearest railway station Sukhbaatar can be reached for 2500 tugriks by collective taxi.
There are no problems with <b>accomodation</b> in Mongolia. The number of hotels is amazing, especially considering that the cities of Mongolia are generally backwaters, and not a resort area. Around the Ulaanbaatar station, every second house is a hotel, often combined with karaoke. Prices for star hotels in Ulaanbaatar are steep, but if you look around, you can find a decent place for $20. On the first day at six in the morning we went to the first one with available rooms at a reasonable price, there was no Internet and the room was crumbling. The next day we found a good establishment farther from the station for the same 35,000 tugriks (called Land Hotel). In Sukhbaatar (a small town 30 kilometers from the Russian border) we also easily found a good hotel for the same 35,000 tugriks = $19.
<b>Transport</b> in Mongolia is bad. In fact, you can travel more or less effectively only along the railway, which crosses the country from north to south. In other regions there are no roads, driving there is difficult and long (especially in winter). Trains in Mongolia are very slow, the carriages are Soviet, but they are very cheap. So, travel from Sukhbaatar to Ulaanbaatar in third class (the ride takes about 9 hours) costs only $9 = 16,400 tugriks, with bed linen and tea. If you travel during the day, you can take tickets for a general seating carriage; they are preserved everywhere in Mongolia. In addition, modern, faster trains, similar to European ones, with seats, are appearing in Mongolia. While they only run on the route Ulaanbaatar - Darkhan (fare 20,000 tugriks), the route Ulaanbaatar - Choir - Sainshand is announced at the station. You can only buy tickets at the station in person; the system is computerized, so you can get a ticket from the intermediate station. There are no online sales, although the website seems to be in preparation. You can buy a ticket on the day of departure.

Mongolian <b>food</b> is not for the faint-hearted and sophisticated aesthetes accustomed to European delights. The food here is harsh and very greasy, not for everyone. The main dish is called tsuiwan - dry noodles with pieces of lamb and vegetables. There are buuzes and khushuurs, just like in Buryatia. There is a dish with a funny name “Khuitsaa” - it’s a delicious soup with meat, pasta, potatoes and other vegetables. A dish in cheap cafes and canteens costs from 4,000 to 6,000 tugriks ($2-$3). Mongolian tea is made from some kind of sour milk, and it is impossible to drink it.

<b>Results</b>
In total, the costs for two amounted to 33,497 rubles and 309,520 tugriks, not counting air tickets. At the current exchange rate, this is less than $700, i.e. the average was about $46 per day. Mongolia is on average cheaper than Russia because there were far fewer long journeys. 48% of expenses are travel, mostly by train, 21% are housing (on average less than $10 per day, but this is because out of 15 days there were 5 night train journeys), 24% are food ($11 per day, in some places they were luxurious , especially in Mongolia) and 7% for everything else.
