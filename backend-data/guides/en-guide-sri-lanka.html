Sri Lanka is a small island south of India. You can fly there from Kuala Lumpur for less than $100 round trip. Sri Lanka is sometimes seen as “India for beginners”, and for some reason there are a lot of beach holidaymakers there.
Also through Sri Lanka lies the cheapest route to the Maldives - a country of expensive paradise resorts.

<b>Visa</b>
$35, double entry (convenient for a trip to the Maldives). For two entries you can spend 30 days in total. A visa is issued via the Internet after filling out an application in about five minutes; you don’t even need a scan of your passport.
It seems like you can get a visa on arrival for $40 and then renew it, but the meaning of this is unclear, because living in Sri Lanka is masochism.
Maldives are visa free for 30 days, theoretically you need a return ticket and $50/day in cash, but I didn’t notice that anyone at passport control was asked about anything.

<b>Money</b>
The currency of Sri Lanka is the rupee, $1 = 145 rupees approximately. Oddly enough, the airport has almost the best rate. There are almost no street exchangers; you can change at a bank.
In the Maldives, the local rupee (rufiyaa) is 10 times more expensive than the Sri Lankan one: $1 = 15 rupees. It seems like you can pay in dollars, but, say, the ferry from the airport will cost $1 instead of 10 rupees.

<b>Accomodation</b>
Hotels in Sri Lanka are expensive for some reason. Probably, high taxes are combined with expensive electricity. Rooms without air conditioning for $20 are common, although $7 may not be far off. On average you can count on 1000 rupees without air conditioning and 2200-2500 with air conditioning, I have not seen anything cheaper. In some cities, housing is especially expensive, for example, in Colombo or Anuradhapura there is nothing for 1000.
The quality of housing is good, there are no problems with the shower, the Internet works.
In the Maldives, housing starts at $30; in the capital, it seems it can be cheaper if you call one of the many advertisements pasted on walls and pillars (all like in Russia). Most tourists, however, live on special islands where there is nothing except a hotel - one night there costs from $300, and a bottle of water from $5, and, of course, there is nothing to do there.

<b>Food</b>
There are problems with food in Sri Lanka. There is simply little of it - it seems to have the lowest density of restaurants per square kilometer in the world, even in the city center (with the exception of the unforgettable East Timor). For ordinary Sri Lankans, restaurants are simply not affordable, and for tourists there are a couple of restaurants with very high prices.
In a budget canteen the assortment is approximately the following: roti flatbreads are standard for 40 rupees, tea or coffee for 40-50 rupees, a portion of rice or noodles without meat is about 100 rupees, with meat 180-250 rupees depending on the meat (it, of course, is not marble beef). In a tourist restaurant, prices will be at least 2-3 times higher, but there will be a larger assortment. In Hikkaduwa - and this is one of the most popular resorts on the island - there is one normal restaurant, where a huge portion of rice with vegetables costs 275 rupees, fried squid or tuna steak with a side dish - 575 rupees, freshly squeezed juice - 175 rupees. This is the restaurant closest to the station; if you walk further along the coastal street, prices rise sharply to 1200 per dish.

At KFC and Burger King the prices are higher than even in Singapore - these are expensive places by local standards. In Malaysia it's half the price.
Inexpensive fruits are great. The main fruits were brought to Sri Lanka from Southeast Asia, so there are durians from 100 rupees (!) for a small durian, mangosteens for 25 rupees per piece, rambutans for 5 rupees per piece.

The shops are also bad. For a long time in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, I got used to the fact that you can go out on the street at three o’clock in the morning, and within a radius of 200 meters from you there will be a stall where you can buy water or cola. In Sri Lanka, everywhere except Colombo, everything closes at 8-9, and the nearest store takes 10 minutes to walk. There are few supermarkets. The only chain I noticed was Food City. Prices for many goods there are twice as high as in Malaysia, especially cookies, candies and chips. I note that even in the Maldives, food in stores is cheaper.

The problem of scams is very acute in Sri Lanka. Even worse than in Bali. Maybe, of course, it was because I didn’t speak the local language at all, but there were too many cases. Sri Lankans stupidly raise the price after the sale, don’t give enough change, hoping for a fool who won’t count the money. Even in the local shop they stupidly inflated the bill. Watch your money carefully.

I found myself in the Maldives during the holy month of Ramadan. For this occasion, 90% of restaurants were closed in principle, and the remaining 10% opened after sunset, which also did not suit me. Only at the airport was the most expensive Burger King in the world - one Whopper there cost $14.
The shops were also not open full time: they closed from 16 to 20. The prices are quite reasonable: water 3 rupees ($0.20, for comparison in Sri Lanka everywhere it's 40 rupees), oranges 3 rupees per piece, apples 5 rupees per piece, OREO cookies from Thailand 14-15 rupees.


<b>Transport</b>
Traveling around Sri Lanka is practically free. By bus it costs 1.5 rupees per kilometer, that is, $1 per 100 kilometers. Only third class trains in Thailand are cheaper. Considering that the whole of Sri Lanka is approximately 600 kilometers from north to south and 200 from west to east, it turns out that you can travel around the entire country for 10 dollars.
Comfort in transport isn't high. The calculation is that 50 people are sitting on the bus, and at least 20 more are standing in the aisle. In Sri Lanka there is no division between city and intercity buses; all buses throughout the country have the same numbering. Therefore, someone goes to a neighboring village, and someone travels 100 kilometers. The crowd can be quite heavy, however, at the exit from a large city the passage gradually becomes empty.

In addition to large buses without glass in the windows (they are normally ventilated), there are smaller buses with air conditioning. It’s not so crowded, they can go non-stop (for example, from Negombo to Colombo), the price is twice as high, but the frequency is much lower than regular ones, so I rarely came across them.
Things are even worse on trains. There's about the same crowd there, but the ratio of the number of people to the number of seats is much smaller, which is why 80% are standing. I went from Colombo to Hikkaduwa (90 kilometers), until Bentota (the first 40-50 kilometers) I was hanging on the handrail, it was so cramped. And all the way to Hikkaduwa there were no free seats.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946301659_9b7c3f16d3_h.jpg"/>
Trains run once an hour at best, and buses every 10-15 minutes. The price even by bus is ridiculously low (it’s cheaper by train: 85 rupees to Hikkaduwa versus 125 by bus), so I don’t recommend the train.
There are tuk-tuks in all cities. For a tourist, the price is approximately 50-70 rupees per kilometer, although theoretically they even have meters. Tuk-tukers inflate the price by 10 times, so you should haggle.
In the Maldives, transport is provided by ferries. I was very pleased with the prices: the ferry from the airport to Male for 10 rupees ($0.65) is the most expensive. The ferry to the island of Villingili costs 3.25, to the artificial island of Hulhumale - 5.50. There are even full-length buses on Hulhumale, although the entire island is 1 kilometer wide! And on Villingili there is a bus in the form of an electric car, this is for an island measuring 500 by 500 meters.
The more distant islands can also be reached by ferry at a low cost, but frequency is an issue. Ferries are aimed at local residents who need to go to Male for shopping or to get some kind of government service, so the schedule is always as follows: departure from Island X at 7 am, departure from Male back in the evening. That is, if you are a tourist, you cannot even go to the popular island of Maafushi in one day; you need to spend at least two nights there. Ferries to more distant islands may not even go every day, so a long journey through the Maldives will be very meditative.

<b>Internet</b>
Sri Lanka has some of the lowest traffic prices, comparable to Cambodia, and cheaper than Thailand and Malaysia. I used the Dialog operator - the largest operator. I bought a SIM card at a kiosk at the bus station, you need a passport for this, they scan it and register the SIM card somehow. The SIM card itself costs Rs 100, and a 500 MB monthly package costs Rs 99. 1 gigabyte of traffic, it turns out, costs less than $1.5. 3G is available in all cities, and since being outside the city in Sri Lanka requires effort, only closer to the north the route goes through an open field, and in the south and center the city is endless.

<b>Entertainment</b>
Although Sri Lanka is a very poor country, much poorer even than Indonesia, not to mention Malaysia or China, pumping money out of tourists here is on a grand scale. Prices for tourist services are disproportionately high. For example, an excursion to Galle costs as much as $40 per car. The drive to Galle is only 15 kilometers. Even in Bali, with their extortionate prices, for $35 you can rent a car with a driver for a day to go somewhere further afield. An excursion to Yala National Park costs $200, although the drive there is also not very far, about 50 kilometers. For what? Of course, due to expensive entrance fees and fees.

Sri Lanka claims a record for the high cost of entry tickets and the degree of discrimination against foreigners. There is such a place there called Sigiriya. It is a stone on which the palace of a local ruler stood a thousand years ago, and now only the foundation of the palace remains. Entrance there costs as much as $30 - one and a half times more expensive than Angkor or Bagan! And for locals the entrance fee is only 50 rupees - 83 times less, which sets a record.
There is a suspicion that someone on the UNESCO Presidium is from Sri Lanka, so as many as 8 places on this small island are included in the list, and accordingly, wherever you can make a paid entrance, it is done in full. At the same time, you can go to approximately the same temples/mountains in the neighborhood for much less. Instead of Anuradhapura, you can visit Mihintale (15 kilometers to the east) - the same white stupa, many ruins, and as a bonus a cool view from above and few people. Entrance 500 rupees.
Instead of Sigiriya, you can climb a nearby stone (2 kilometers to the north), from where you can see Sigiriya itself. Entrance 500 rupees, close to 0 visitors.

As for the beaches, I didn’t see anything really impressive. I don’t recommend Negombo at all, it’s an overrated dump. In the south, the coast looks quite pleasant, although swimming is inconvenient due to the waves. Due to the lack of civilization, it is dull in the evening. Here is a resort in Thailand:

Here is a resort in Indonesia:

Colombo is the capital of Sri Lanka, usually ignored by tourists, but it is almost the most comfortable place in the country: there is some kind of civilization there, and no one there bothers you or tries to shortchange you or squeeze change; everything is much cheaper on the market than in other places. It's a pity that there are no normal cheap hotels there.

<b>Results</b>
Ignoring the unnecessarily expensive attractions, I easily stayed within the $30 per day budget, even with expensive accommodations accounting for almost half of the cost. Well, there’s not enough good food, transport is almost free, there’s nowhere to go for a walk.

I’m unlikely to go to Sri Lanka for the second time. There is nothing worth going there for: for nature you have to go to Indonesia, for comfort - to Thailand and Malaysia, there are Buddhist temples in abundance in Myanmar.
