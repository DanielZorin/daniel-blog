Singapore is the only country in Southeast Asia with a high standard of living by world standards, an island of Europe (and America) in the region, as well as the main local financial and business center.

<b>Money</b>
The currency of Singapore is the Singapore dollar. In order not to confuse it with the American one, in the future if it is written with the words “dollar”, it means Singaporean, and if there is a $ sign, then it is American. 1 Singapore dollar = 0.72 USD = 3 Malayan ringit = 25 Thai baht.
The ATM at the airport immediately gave me 1000 SGD without blinking an eye.

<b>Visa</b>
Russia is one of about 40 countries in the world that require a visa to Singapore. Even citizens of Honduras, Burkina Faso and the Republic of Congo do not need a visa. Luckily, citizens of post-Soviet countries are privileged among the outcasts and can obtain the visa online.
I got my visa through the website <a href="http://singaporeguides.ru">singaporeguides.ru</a>. It costs about $38, you don’t need any documents except a scan of your passport and a photograph. The waiting time is announced to be 4-5 working days, but in reality the visa was ready the very next day.
You can enter without a visa in transit for up to 96 hours, but this did not suit me - I was traveling back to Malaysia. Going to Indonesia meant having to buy a plane ticket from Singapore, which was more expensive.

<b>Accomodation</b>
Housing is bad by Asian standards. There is nothing cheaper than $35 at all. It’s only worse in Macau (while in Hong Kong, Seoul, Taipei it’s still better). Out of despair, I even went to airbnb in an attempt to rent an apartment, but, as usual, this site turned out to be filled with all sorts of rubbish, such as hostel advertising. Four attempts to book an apartment ended in failure, so I had to stay in a hostel. A place in a decent hostel cost 17 Singapore dollars ($12.5).

<b>Food</b>
When you go to a Singaporean store, for example, 7-11, after Malaysia the prices seem exactly the same. But in Malaysia, prices are in ringgits, and in Singapore - in Singapore dollars, each worth three ringgits. Some ice cream in Malaysia costs 2 ringit, in Singapore - 2 dollars. By and large, everything is not so bad - in Europe it’s also not cheap, and in the USA it’s still twice as expensive. But who wants to spend money on all sorts of goodies when you know that after the border bridge prices will drop three times, the bridge is only 20 kilometers away, and in a couple of days you will be there? Judging by the long queues to leave on Friday evening and to enter on Sunday, many Singaporeans share my opinion and go to Malaysia to shop. As far as I understand, it is not prohibited to bring food for personal use. Mandatory duties are only on alcohol and cigarettes in any quantity, so it is better to give up bad habits.
In the Fair Price store, as its name suggests, you can buy food at a reasonable price (twice as expensive as Malaysia, not three times). There is cheap ice cream for $3, Toblerone chocolate for $2, canned goods, noodles, etc.
The trend in restaurants is the same. Eating noodles/rice in a canteen costs from 3.5 to 6 dollars (in Malaysia the same in ringgits), eating at McDonald's or KFC will be about twice as expensive as Malaysia (5-8 dollars). Since the food in Singapore is no different from Malaysia (the same Chinese, Indian and Malay dishes), I saw no point in studying the local cuisine, making a choice in favor of the most nutritious food. This was found, oddly enough, on the Burger King chain. In general, it is more expensive there than in McDonald's, but, like in Russia, there are excellent promotions there. Write down the recipe: four Chicken 'n Crisp burgers for $1 and a Coke Float for $1.50. Total 5.5, or about $4. This is enough for two. No noodle shop will offer this price-to-nutrition ratio even close.

PS Don't buy Mexican drumlets for two dollars, these are the smallest pieces of chicken I've ever seen in my life.

<b>Transport</b>
Singapore has a metro card, like Hong Kong, but the $5 deposit is non-refundable, so its worth to tourists is questionable. I took the bus exactly once - to the border with Malaysia, everything else by metro. For the metro I used single trip tickets. The maximum I paid was 2.40 dollars from the airport, usually it's 1.4-1.7 in the city. For a one-time magnetic ticket you need to pay an additional 10 cents, but you can use it 6 times, with a 10 cent discount for the third and sixth times.
You can enter Sentosa Island for free by walking across the bridge from the nearest MRT station. It is unclear why a $30 cable car is needed. Buses within the island are free.
Walking around Singapore is quite unpleasant, oddly enough. Many intersections are made with sophisticated sadism towards pedestrians: there may not be a zebra crossing on one side of the intersection (cross three times, friends!), crossings through one or two lanes at huge intervals. The buttons for turning on the green light work - if you forget to press, then the red light will be on for pedestrians even while the red light is on for cars. Combined with the fine for jaywalking, this makes Singapore a very difficult place to walk, much like Bangkok.

The border with Malaysia is crossed by bus. There are several companies. SBS buses are Singapore buses, they stop everywhere along the route in Singapore, and after the border they go to Larkin Bus Station in Johor without stopping. Causeway Link buses, on the contrary, make stops in Malaysia and go to the final destination in Singapore. The terminal stations are different, the most useful stops are at the Kranji and Woodlands metro stations closest to the border and the stop on Queen street in the city center. From Queen street the SBS bus costs 2.5 dollars, Causeway link - 3.3. At both border terminals you need to disembark and go through customs and passport control. If you are traveling to Singapore from Malaysia, the prices will be lower, although not three times. But for a train going across the border, the price differs exactly three times - 5 dollars and 5 ringgits. In Malaysia you can buy a return ticket for 10 ringgits, but in Singapore - only for 10 dollars.

<b>Entertainment</b>
The only entertainment I spent money on in Singapore was entry to the public swimming pool (with lanes), which cost less than $2. The botanical gardens and chain of hilltop parks along the south shore are free. Sentosa Island, where the beach and amusement parks are, is now (in 2016) also free if you walk across the bridge from the nearest metro.

In general, in Singapore, like in any decent big city, there are all the means for a hard-working family to spend their only vacation of the year (all sorts of attractions, wax figures, zoo, beach, etc.). Prices for all this are about the same as in Europe.
Persistent researchers of Asia will be interested in Singapore as an oasis of high civilization in the region: the complete absence of slums, a high level of cleanliness (no, I also saw garbage on the streets, but you need to look for it), buildings in perfect condition with historical value (by the way, there are quite a few of them), an American-style business center.
Singapore is also the only place in Asia that can be considered as an option for long-term non-retirement living: here you can study at a global level, run a business, and after a few years of residence obtain citizenship.

<b>Conclusion</b>
The vast majority of expenses in Singapore are housing. We spent $8 a day on food - below average, because the economy mode was on. $25 for travel around the city.
