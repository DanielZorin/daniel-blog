Continuing my exploration of Latin America, in October-November I traveled to the countries between Mexico and Colombia. The choice fell on them for several reasons: firstly, all land borders there are open, that is, you can travel everywhere, as in 2019 (in South America you can still only enter most countries by plane). Secondly, the countries are small, the trip could be completed in 1-1.5 months. Thirdly, it is difficult and expensive to get there bypassing the United States, so I wanted to get there while my visa is still valid. And of course, visiting 7 new countries at once in 2021 sounds tempting. I thought about the route a long time ago; actually, there aren’t that many options, since the countries are located one after another, except that Belize can be skipped.

<b>Visa and entry</b>
All countries in Central America are visa-free for Russian citizens, except Belize - to enter there you need a Canadian, American or Schengen visa (or Belizean, but getting it is much more difficult).
Due to coronavirus restrictions:
<b>Belize</b>: you need a PCR test (96 hours) and a hotel reservation from the “gold standard” list (in fact, almost all hotels from booking.com are on the list, including budget ones). When entering by land, the test is taken at the border.
<b>Guatemala</b>: PCR test or vaccination certificate (Sputnik V is accepted).
<b>El Salvador</b>: PCR test or vaccination certificate (Sputnik V is accepted).
<b>Honduras</b>: PCR test or vaccination certificate (Sputnik V is accepted).
<b>Nicaragua</b>: PCR test only. One of the most problematic borders in my life, at the entrance they asked more questions than in the USA, they held me for three hours. On the way out there were again a lot of questions.
<b>Costa Rica</b>: you need to buy health insurance from them (~$10/day) or show a vaccination certificate (Western vaccines ONLY).
<b>Panama</b>: PCR test or vaccination certificate (Western vaccines ONLY).

I flew to Belize via the USA and got the Janssen vaccine there. By the time I got to Costa Rica and Panama, two weeks had already passed, so I took the test only in Honduras to enter Nicaragua (as usual in poor countries, tests are expensive: in the capital there is one place for $80, and in resorts generally for $200 ). I also took a test in Panama to return to the US, a cheaper and faster antigen test costs $35.
Some borders charge fees:
- Belize - departure $20
- Honduras - entry $3
- Nicaragua - entry $13, exit $3
- Costa Rica - departure $9



<b>Money</b>
A whole bunch of currencies. It’s weird with exchange, there are no bureaus anywhere at all, although it would seem there are a lot of different currencies here. Money is changed by special money changers who sit in central squares and carry stacks of banknotes, and this is even somehow licensed (they have badges). For some reason, there is always a long queue at banks, so I was only in a bank in Costa Rica, where there are no money changers in the cities (or I did not find them).
In hotels you can pay in dollars everywhere, but they can give change at a bad rate, especially in Costa Rica it’s not good, you can lose up to 10%, so in Costa Rica it is best to change money at a bank (or withdraw from an ATM).
I used the ATM only once in Guatemala, there was a fee and a small limit.
<b>Belize</b>: Belize dollar, 1 USD = 2 BZD exactly, you can pay in American dollars everywhere.
<b>Guatemala</b>: quetzal, 1 USD = 7.5 GTQ.
<b>El Salvador</b>: US dollar and suddenly Bitcoin (1 BTC = 60,000 USD or so). Only American coins. Bitcoins are actually accepted even in some stalls on the market, there are also Bitcoin ATMs.
<b>Honduras</b>: lempira, 1 USD = 25 HNL.
<b>Nicaragua</b>: cordoba, 1 USD = 35 NIO.
<b>Costa Rica</b>: colon, 1 USD = 630 CRC.
<b>Panama</b>: US dollar + local Balboa coins, parallel to American ones

<b>Accomodation</b>
Hotels in these countries are quite cheap. A normal room with air conditioning costs an average of 20-25 dollars. In some cities at higher altitudes above sea level it is okay without air conditioning, then you can find something decent for $12-15. Basically, I booked accommodation on Booking 1 day before arrival, mainly so as not to waste time searching, and to have a rough idea of ​​what to expect. In Guatemala, for the first two days I looked for a hotel locally, and I really didn’t like the result (although it was cheap - about 10 dollars). In El Salvador, when I was looking near the bus station, so as not to repeat the mistake, I went around about 5 hotels and chose the most expensive one (with a super-armored door with remote control, but most importantly clean).
The only country with expensive hotels is Belize. It’s just significantly more expensive here - in Belize City the cheapest hotel cost as much as 60 dollars, in the provinces - 30. At the resorts it’s even more expensive.

<i>One of the worst hotels in my life</i>
<b>Transport</b>
You are unlikely to need planes, all countries are small, so there are almost no domestic flights, and they are very expensive. There are also almost no flights between countries, only with transfers in Panama or Miami.
There are no trains, so you have to take buses to travel everywhere. There are two classes of buses: cheap (called chicken bus) and more expensive. 90% of my trips were on cheap ones, and not because I really wanted to save money, but because it was faster and more convenient. As a rule, cheap buses depart from one point somewhere near the center and the main market (except in capital cities, where there may be several such “bus stations”). I just come there and within 10 minutes I am moving where I need to. If I need to change buses, I get off one bus and get on another 50 meters later. Most often, cheap buses are old American school buses; of course, they have no air conditioning, but they also have no windows, so they travel with the breeze.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946422150_46f63ab18a_h.jpg"/>
On the other hand, expensive buses are really hard to figure out. In <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/673109.html">Brazil</a> a bus station has 100 windows, each for its own company. And in Guatemala there are 100 bus stations, each small company has its own, and all in different parts of the city. Understanding which company you need is not so easy. When such a need arose, I googled “bus city-A city-B” and found groups on Facebook, where sometimes you could even find out the schedule. Usually these buses leave once an hour at best, so you need to know when to arrive.
There was a similar bus system in Cambodia, but in Cambodia there is a “service” for tourists - you go to a travel agency or hotel reception, and they will sell you a ticket, and a tuk-tuk will take you to the “bus station” on the outskirts at the right time. In Central America, this is only possible in Guatemala, where I actually used “tourist” transport, which is more expensive than usual, but allows you to get, for example, from Antigua to Lake Atitlan without transfers. In Honduras, the hostel couldn’t help me in any way; I found out everything myself. By the way, in Honduras I once traveled on the most expensive bus, which was three times more expensive than the others, and it turned out to be bad - the bus was old, there weren’t even USB sockets, even the toilet didn’t work.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946225658_6d7b07fab9_h.jpg"/>
Separately, it is worth mentioning buses between countries. There are some companies that travel across borders. The most famous of them is Ticabus. Now their schedules seem to be reduced, at best one departure a day. Moreover, these buses run only between capitals; in other cities along the way, theoretically, you can get off or on, but usually on a bypass, and not at the bus station. Since I went not only to the capitals, these buses were mostly inconvenient for me, so I passed almost all the borders on foot, taking a local bus to the border crossing. The only long-distance bus across the border was from Guatemala to El Salvador - I asked a travel agency for a ticket from Antigua to El Salvador via the capital. This was the most expensive ticket by a wide margin - $50 (just from the capital without transportation from Antigua, a ticket cost $35, and in some companies it can be even $25). On the other hand, I crossed the border early and had a lot to see in El Salvador that day, so the cost was generally justified.
All of the above does not apply to one country - Costa Rica. There is no division into expensive and cheap buses, because there are no “cheap” old buses there, modern ones are everywhere. But buses do not run every 10 minutes, and may even go 1-2 times a day in some direction, so you need to look at the schedule. There is a website <a href="https://thebusschedule.com/cr/">https://thebusschedule.com/cr/</a> that allows you to build routes even with transfers, but the schedules there are inaccurate. It is advisable to check in Facebook groups or on the websites of bus companies (fortunately, the website with schedules will tell you the name of the company).

When it comes to getting around the city, the only place I've taken public transportation is Panama City. There are metro and buses, fare on the metro is $0.35, on the bus $0.25, you must buy a travel card to pay. In other cities, I either walked or took a taxi, not only because it is difficult to figure out the routes, but also for safety reasons, because large cities are the most dangerous. Typically, I used the Uber app. It operates in the capitals and largest cities of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Panama. Nicaragua has its own Ray app, which differs in that after ordering, the operator calls you to clarify where you are standing and what you look like (but otherwise it works like Uber, the driver also sees your position). The price of a ride on Uber is low - 2-5 dollars. In Belize, unfortunately, there are no apps, and I was on a weekend when there were no buses around the city, so I spent a lot there - each trip cost $10, and from the airport it was as high as $25. I also spent $40 to take a taxi to the top of Poas Volcano in Costa Rica because it turns out the bus only goes there on weekends.

<b>Food</b>
I did not find any outstanding cuisine in these countries. The food is about the same everywhere, the essence is this: you choose a piece of meat, and with it you are given a bunch of side dishes of different types: standard rice, beans, lettuce, tomatoes, and of course, fried banana.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945963176_05b88674a3_h.jpg"/>
In Costa Rica it's called "Casado", but in other countries it's basically the same kind of food in the fast food joints. This thing costs 5 dollars give or take, which is quite inexpensive, considering the volume and nutriciousness of the food. Panama and Guatemala are somewhat more expensive than other countries; a similar lunch there can cost 7-8 dollars.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946300949_24a8e05e67_h.jpg"/>
The American influence in food is felt - McDonald's is even in Honduras. It's not cheaper there - a combo costs the same 5-6 dollars. Local fast food chains are usually similar to KFC with fried chicken. Interestingly, they have similar names - Pollo Campestre, Pollo Campero.
In Costa Rica, I found cheap seafood - the plate below with lobster cost only $13. In other countries, fish and seafood are not very popular.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946300799_61dca9f855_h.jpg"/>
I visited supermarkets very rarely. They exist in all countries, but not that many - usually only very large supermarkets, or small no-name stalls; there is no chains of mid-sized shops. Supermarkets work for a wealthy audience, this became especially noticeable to me in Panama, where I lived in an upscale area, without no-name stalls, and it turned out that almost all the goods in the supermarket were from the USA with corresponding prices. There wasn’t even anything to buy in terms of fruit, everything was terribly expensive, even apples were more than $5 per kilogram.
By the way, about fruits. They are quite easy to buy on the streets, you don’t even have to go to the market - someone is always selling them from a cart for cheap. Among the unusual fruits for Europe, one can find guava, rambutan (in El Salvador it is called Licha, although lychee is not rambutan, in other countries it is Mamon china) and dragonfruit, and less commonly carambola and soursop (guanabana). In Costa Rica, farms even conduct successful experiments in growing durians, but they are not widely sold.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946422055_17bb62e45d_h.jpg"/>
<b>Internet</b>
In each country, I bought a SIM card upon entry immediately after the border or in the nearest city, except Belize, where everything was closed on Saturday, and on Monday I no longer bothered for one day. The most expensive Internet was in Guatemala, where a SIM card cost $7, and traffic was not particularly cheap. In El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, for 2-4 dollars I received 3-4 gigabytes, which was enough for me for the duration of my stay in the country. The Internet was not very cheap and at the same time bad in Costa Rica - $3 for 1 gigabyte or $6 for 2.5 gigabytes, there were no bigger packages. The most voluminous (unlimited) was in Panama for $5 per week.
SIM cards are sold on every corner in all sorts of stalls and grocery stores. Everywhere except Honduras, registration is required, but it is not difficult and sellers usually cope. In Costa Rica, you need to call the call center yourself to register, but they even have English-language support.

<b>Security</b>
The most pressing question in these countries, given that El Salvador is #1 in the world in the number of murders, Honduras #3, and Guatemala is also in the top 20. In principle, I can repeat my reasoning from <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/673109.html">review about Brazil</a>. On this trip I became more paranoid, and I went outside for a walk after dark for the first time only in Nicaragua. But I got up every day at 6 am, because I was so used to it after changing time zones, and I just managed to have time to see as much as possible. During the day, the central streets, even in dangerous cities, are very crowded, so there isn't little risk of an assault, although in El Salvador there are still respectable guards with guns and machine guns on the streets.

<b>What to see</b>
<b>Belize</b>
The only country where the official language is English, not Spanish. Fairly safe, but the most expensive by a wide margin due to expensive housing.
- Belize City is the largest city, in some guidebooks it is designated as dangerous, but in my opinion, compared to the others, it is normal. Even the hotel owner told me that you can walk around the center with a camera.
- The islands on the Belize Barrier Reef are the main place where tourists go to relax on the beach and dive. The most popular and relatively inexpensive is Caye Caulker, the rest are quite expensive. Caye Caulker is like Thailand, only more expensive. Hotels from $60 without aircon, snorkeling around the island costs $40-50, going to the Blue Hole - $300+
- Belmopan is the capital, there is parliament and ministries, and nothing else in particular
- San Ignacio - near the ruins of the Mayan city of Xunantunich (entrance $5)
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946225768_842b6ada65_h.jpg"/>
<b>Guatemala</b>
The most populous country, similar to Mexico, but poorer and more dangerous. I visited all the important places:
- Tikal is the most famous Mayan city along with the later Chichen Itza in Mexico.
- Flores is the closest city to Tikal, on an island in the middle of the lake
- Livingston is a holiday destination on the Caribbean Sea, accessible only by boat along the Rio Dulce River (very beautiful) or along the coast
- Guatemala is the capital, a dangerous and unattractive city. I didn’t have much time, so I only looked at the very center and left for the next city:
- Antigua Guatemala - the old capital, a pleasant colonial city, seemed to me to be empty, probably due to the fact that it relied heavily on foreign tourists, of whom there are few now
- Lake Atitlan - a place to relax, lake, volcanoes around, beauty
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946225798_d71f132790_h.jpg"/>
<b>El Salvador</b>
Statistically, it is the most dangerous country, but overall I liked it, and except for the capital, I felt quite comfortable everywhere. It is very convenient to get around; buses go to any village every 10 minutes.
- San Salvador is the capital, a very dangerous city. The hotel where I lived had an armored door. There is a big market in the center, there are better areas with lots of shops and fast food, like in America
- “Road of Flowers” ​​- a route between the cities of Ahuachapan and Sonsonate, you can stop in small towns along the way (I saw three - Apaneca, Huayua and Nahuizalco), stare at the colonial architecture and coffee plantations
- La Libertad is a resort on the Pacific Ocean, there seems to be good surfing and it’s cheap, that’s why tourists come here
- San Miguel is the second largest city near the volcano of the same name
In general, there are a lot of volcanoes in El Salvador, but you can’t climb one just like that; you need to equip an expedition with armed guards.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946300784_a032236fda_h.jpg"/>
<b>Honduras</b>
- Tegucigalpa is the capital, a very dangerous city, which is nevertheless very picturesque due to its location on the hills. There are quite decent areas and even a few high-rise buildings.
- Comayagua is a historical capital with colonial architecture
- San Pedro Sula is the second largest city, famous for the fact that it had the first place in the world in the number of murders. Quite boring, there’s nothing to see even in the center. It looked much nicer than I thought - there are quite a few new shopping centers and some good-looking areas.
Also in Honduras you can see the ruins of the Mayan city of Copan, but I didn’t go there because it’s very far away, and I’ve already seen similar cities in Mexico, Guatemala and Belize. And there is also the island of Roatan, this could be a good place for relaxing and diving, but I didn’t go, because the beach areas are not particularly cool alone, and it’s too far to go there.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946300769_b1016c728b_h.jpg"/>
<b>Nicaragua</b>
A controversial and unusual country. It is the poorest of all, salaries are super low, and people are leaving so en masse that even neighboring Costa Rica has introduced visas. The reason is that the socialists are in power here - the local dictator is friends only with Maduro and Putin. On the other hand, since there is a dictatorship here, there is almost no organized crime, and walking the streets is much safer than in Honduras and El Salvador. It’s also cheap here and, despite the poverty, there are many decent hotels and restaurants.
- Leon - there is a cathedral from the UNESCO list
- Matagalpa - a cool city in the mountains
- Managua is the capital, destroyed by an earthquake, so it’s not very interesting (except perhaps as an example of Soviet development on the other side of the world)
- Masaya - there is an incredible smoking volcano that you can easily climb
- Granada is the most pleasant and beautiful colonial city on this trip, the only city in which I would not mind staying longer
- Rivas/Ometepe Island - a holiday island in the middle of a lake (reminiscent of Lake Toba in Indonesia).
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946422130_16805b238a_h.jpg"/>
<b>Costa Rica</b>
The best country in the region. In terms of money, it’s only a little more expensive than the others, but there are civilized buses, it’s quite safe, clean and beautiful everywhere, it’s a pleasure to be here. In terms of attractions, there is nothing particularly outstanding here, at least for those who have been to <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/431498.html">Indonesia</a> and <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/423990.html">Malaysia</a> - national parks with tropical forests are very similar, but there weren’t really any colonial cities in Costa Rica.
- San Jose, Cartago, Heredia, Alajuela - four cities adjacent to each other, forming the metropolitan agglomeration. Many people say that the capital is bad, but in my opinion it’s okay compared to previous capitals, although not as nice as smaller cities
- Limon is a city on the Caribbean coast, there wasn’t much to see in it, to get the beach you have to go to Puerto Viejo de Talamanca for another hour and a half
- Arenal Volcano - a beautiful place with a lake and a volcano
- Poas Volcano - you can go to the very top by car/bus and see the crater with a blue lake
- Puntarenas is the main city on the Pacific coast. Ferries run from here to the Nicoya Peninsula, where there are beach villages
- Manuel Antonio National Park is the most famous national park in the country, beautiful tropical forest and beaches, alas, I did not see any animals (except for monkeys).
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945963166_40544bb1f8_h.jpg"/>
<b>Panama</b>
A controversial country, it is nominally richer than Costa Rica, but the wealth here is clearly concentrated in just one city. Outside the capital there is not much to see on the mainland.
- Panama is the capital, the most developped and interesting big city in the region, there are a lot of skyscrapers and a metro. I lived in a good area (unlike other cities) and hardly saw any bad areas, except perhaps near the historical center. The old town is quite boring and dead - there are almost no cafes. You can also see the ruins of the original colonial settlement, and visit the Panama Canal locks.
- Colon is the second largest city, a complete mess and the worst city on this trip. Very dirty and creepy. Nearby there is an entrance to the Panama Canal and Portobelo
- Portobelo is a village on the shores of the Caribbean Sea, where Spanish forts have been preserved
- David is the third largest city, nothing particularly remarkable
In addition, there are two groups of beach islands in Panama: San Blas (closer to the capital and more expensive) and Bocas del Toro (very far from the capital and more affordable).
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946422085_1ce8762e8a_h.jpg"/>
<b>Results</b>
I am very pleased with this trip, first of all, of course, because in the current difficult conditions I managed to carry out everything according to plan, without having any problems anywhere. I remembered my youth, did everything hardcore - alone with a backpack and at a fast pace.
Expenses for the month directly in Central America amounted to almost exactly $2000. Plus the flight is about $1000 + expenses in the USA on the way there and back + I flew from the USA to the Bahamas (+1 more country, but this is <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/446698.html">Caribbean islands</a>).
The normal budget is about $50 per day, on average it came out more due to travel expenses + some one-time expenses such as coronavirus tests.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946225783_5a3032561e_b.jpg"/>

In some countries I even managed $50 on average. Below are diagrams for each country separately (clickable):

In general, the Central American region is quite interesting for travel (especially if you add <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/348385.html">Mexico</a>). I can say that this is a kind of Southeast Asia in the Western Hemisphere - it is also warm and cheap, suitable for backpacking. There are nice beaches, volcanoes, ancient ruins, colonial cities, exotic animals and fruits. Another plus is that everyone speaks Spanish (except Belize, where they speak English) - it’s easier to communicate than Khmer or Burmese. The disadvantages, of course, are, first of all, the high level of crime. The food is not as varied as in Asia, of course, and in general the countries of Southeast Asia are more different from each other - there is more variety. Well, getting from Europe is more expensive than to Southeast Asia, and it is advisable to have a US visa for transit.
