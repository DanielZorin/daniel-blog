Last week I traveled to Lebanon, a small country in the Middle East north of Israel. Lebanon also borders Syria, but due to the war in that country it is relatively difficult to get there (you need to arrange a visa in advance with a travel agency), so Lebanon is now practically an island where you need to fly in and out. There are direct flights from Antalya that are quite inexpensive, you don’t need a visa, and there are no Covid restrictions either, so I decided to fly. Lebanon turned out to be a very interesting and diverse country, despite its modest size.

<b>Money</b>
Lebanon's currency is called the Lebanese pound (livre in French). For some time, its rate was fixed at 1,500 LBP per 1 US dollar, but since 2018, Lebanon has experienced a severe economic crisis, due to which GDP has fallen by half (!) in five years, and there is hyperinflation in the country. At the end of November 2022, the black market rate was 39,500 pounds per dollar, that is, the currency had already depreciated 25 times. Since this rate is unofficial, you need to go to Lebanon only with cash - although there are theoretically ATMs there, you can withdraw from them only at the official rate. Be careful and do not pay for anything online using your card! I had the default payment card in the Uber app (from previous trips), but I switched to cash in Lebanon.
You can exchange money at the real rate at exchange offices (Exchange) or at a money transfer agency (OMT, Western Union).
In some places they may take cash dollars, for example, in a large supermarket I saw someone pay in dollars and receive change in pounds, but it’s not a fact that there will be a better rate there, and they won’t accept it everywhere - when I bought a SIM card, they didn’t take dollars from me, had to change.

<b>Language</b>
Lebanon is inhabited by Arabs, but many of them are Christians, which makes this country so unique among other Arab countries. Before the civil war that began in 1970, the Christians were a majority; now, most likely, they aren't any more, since many Christians are leaving, and Muslim refugees from Syria, on the contrary, are coming. According to some estimates, there are up to 8 million people of Lebanese origin in Brazil alone, which is more than the entire population of Lebanon.
Christians live mainly in the central coastal area, including Beirut and Mount Lebanon (north of Beirut). In the north, near the city of Tripoli, Sunni Muslims live, and in the south, near the Israeli border, and in the east along the Syrian border, Shiite Muslims live, among whom the well-known Hezbollah group is popular.
The official language in Lebanon is Arabic, but it is very easy to get by as so many people speak English or French. Lebanon was a colony of France until 1943, and almost half of the population still speaks French; moreover, educated Lebanese, even among themselves, often speak French or English instead of Arabic.

<b>Accomodation</b>
I lived only in Beirut, from there it took no more than 2 hours to travel to anywhere in the country. Accommodation in Lebanon is relatively expensive and not very good - on booking.com, the cheapest hotels start at 40-50 dollars, and have a rating of 4-5 out of 10, which is really very bad. I ended up renting an apartment through AirBnB for 140 dollars for 5 days (less than 30 per day), it was pretty good - there were several rooms, and electricity was proudly announced 24/7 (in Lebanon there is a problem with this, by default electricity is cut several hours a day, so you need a generator). Electricity was indeed stable, as was hot water. The only problem was to walk up to the 7th floor, since there was no elevator.

<b>Food</b>
Lebanon has good local cuisine, many dishes will be familiar to those who have been to neighboring Israel - the same hummus, falafel. I liked the local salads such as tabbouleh and fattoush:

Kebabs here are less spicy than in Turkey.

The local drink is called jallab - made from dates and rose water.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-lebanon-812212_original.jpg" title=""/>

The prices are quite affordable. I ate mostly at a fairly solid looking restaurant close to home called Dar. Salads and appetizers cost around $3, grilled dishes cost $6-7. For comparison, at McDonald's a combo with a Big Mac also costs about $6 (235k pounds).
It is very unusual that in Lebanon you can buy goods directly from Europe in a supermarket - French cheese, Spanish jamon. I couldn’t buy Spanish jamon either in Georgia or even in Greece (on a small island, though, you can probably find it in Athens), but in Lebanon it just lay there and cost 3 dollars.

But Coca-Cola is not sold anywhere, only Pepsi for some reason.

<b>Transport</b>
Public transport in Lebanon is represented by buses and minibuses. To go south and inland (to Baalbek or to the Syrian border), you need to get to the Cola Junction bus station, it is easily located on the maps. To the north, buses used to run from Charles Helou bus station near the port, but after the 2020 explosion there is nothing there anymore. They now start further east, in the area of ​​the Dawra/Dora roundabout, and you can also catch them even further in front of the City Mall. In all directions there are small, cramped minibuses with a very low ceiling, which also have reclining seats that block the passage. There are also larger buses going north to Tripoli, which are cheaper than minibuses. In Tripoli, these buses stand on the corner near the clock tower.
There are also large Connexion buses that leave from the Martyrs Square parking lot in central Beirut, but I didn't take them.
Travel prices are approximately as follows:
Beirut - Baalbek - 150k (with a transfer in the city of Chtoura)
Beirut - Tripoli - 50k (bus, minibus a little more expensive)
Beirut - Byblos - 20k
Byblos - Batroun - 30k (minibus)
Beirut - Saida - 40k
Saida - Sour - 50k

There are also buses around the city, but they are quite few and run only on major highways. I traveled around Beirut and its immediate surroundings only by taxi through the Uber app. A trip around Beirut usually costs exactly 110k (less than $3), to the airport about 180-200k, even to the Jeita cave I paid only 300k (and it’s a long way there, almost 30 kilometers). Uber is very popular here, you don’t have to wait at all - they arrive in 2-3 minutes.

<b>Internet</b>
I bought a SIM card from the Touch operator, it cost 500k ($12.5), of which about 300k was the empty SIM card itself and another 200k for a 6 gigabyte Internet package.
My rented apartment had Wi-Fi, but it was very slow, which is not typical for apartments - usually when you rent through airbnb, there are no problems with the Internet, since it is only for you, and not for all hotel guests.
DrimSim does not work in Lebanon at all.

<b>What to see</b>
<b>Beirut</b> is the capital, a very contrasting city. Due to the economic crisis and the consequences of the explosion, many things have closed, especially in the city center and the Souqs area, where there are still boutiques of the Dolce Gabbana level, but somehow there are no visitors. The historical center is generally guarded by checkpoints so that there are no demonstrations near the parliament; you walk around the central square as if under quarantine.

<b>Jounieh</b> is a city north of Beirut, in the past it was a major party place with hotels, beaches, casinos, bars, but it seems most of it is closed. You can climb the mountain to the Notre-Dame de Lebanon church by cable car. Also in the mountains near Jounieh there is the famous Jeita cave - these are actually two caves at once, in one you can take a boat ride, and in the other you can walk. For some reason, photography is prohibited there.

<b>Byblos</b> (Jubail in Arabic) is considered the most ancient city in the world currently existing. World Heritage Site
<img alt="" src="images/guide-lebanon-812968_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Batroun</b> is a small town on the coast, its architecture and atmosphere are reminiscent of cities on the Greek islands.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-lebanon-814740_1000.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Tripoli</b> (Trablus in Arabic) is the second largest city with a Muslim population, there is a castle on a hill and many colorful streets.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-lebanon-814052_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Saida</b> (also Sidon) is a very picturesque city in the south, with an extensive historical district that is similar to the best Middle Eastern cities like Yazd and Urfa.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-lebanon-813356_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Sour</b> (also Tyre) is another historic city in the south, less interesting in my opinion than Saida, but it also has Roman ruins listed as a World Heritage Site.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-lebanon-813679_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Baalbek</b> is an inland city that has some of the most impressive Roman ruins I've seen (also a World Heritage Site).
<img alt="" src="images/guide-lebanon-810507_original.jpg" title=""/>

Museum ticket prices are quite low:
Baalbek - 300k
Byblos - 200k
Saida (castle) - 80k
Sour - 120k + 120k (there are two different zones with excavations)
Jeita Cave - 134k
Cable car - 200k

<b>Conclusion</b>
In five days I spent about $330, almost half on housing. I didn’t save much on food, and I used taxis when necessary. Round-trip tickets cost another $200 (it could have been cheaper, but I took it at the very last moment, literally the day before departure).
