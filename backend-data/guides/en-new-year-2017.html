It's time to look back at 2017!

This year I visited <b>19 countries</b>, of which <b>5 new ones</b>: <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/india">India</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/nepal">Nepal</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/japan">Japan</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/order% 20of%20malta">Order of Malta</a>.

I have visited <b>14 countries</b> again:
<a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/russia">Russia</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/finland">Finland</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/poland">Poland</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/italy">Italy</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/vatican">Vatican</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/malta"> Malta</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/germany">Germany</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/latvia">Latvia</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/estonia">Estonia</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/turkey">Turkey</a>,

I had previously been to Greece in 1997, so it can be considered that this was also my first time.

I stayed in <b>75 hotels</b> (including hostels and airbnb), in 5 houses. Also spent 20 nights on the road:
- on trains in Russia, India, Bangladesh and Thailand
- on buses in Estonia, Finland, Nepal
- five times on a plane
- once at the airport.

The most <b>expensive</b> hotel was in Italy for 40 euros, in Germany it was about the same. In all other places $25 and below.
The <b>cheapest</b> hotels were in Nepal on the track, but there they actually make money as a restaurant. Of the rest, the cheapest was in India for 180 rupees ($3, the city of Jodhpur, by the way, a good hotel, there have been much worse ones in India and at the same time much more expensive).

During the year I took <a href="http://flightdiary.net/danielzorin">25 <b>flights</b></a>.
I traveled by <b>trains</b> (intercity) in the following countries: Italy, Germany, Russia, India, Bangladesh, Thailand, Japan.
By <b>metro</b> in the cities: St. Petersburg, Naples, Rome, Berlin, Hamburg, Moscow, Delhi, Gurgaon, Kolkata, Kuala Lumpur, Cochin, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Jaipur, Athens, Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagoya, Kyoto, Osaka, Fukuoka.
