Spain is one of my favorite countries in Europe and in the world in general. It has an almost perfect balance - beautiful, comfortable, friendly, not very expensive. Lots of attractions, great food, warm weather and easy to understand language. One of the best countries to obtain a Schengen visa. It is not surprising that I have been to Spain 12 times, much more than any other European country. In total, I was in Spain for 113 days - only Russia, Turkey, Malaysia, Thailand and China are ahead.

December 2023 - Madrid, Valladolid, Leon, Oviedo, Gijon, Aviles, Santander, Burgos, Logroño, Bilbao, Alicante, Elche, Murcia

<img alt="" src="images/guide-spain-908686_1000.png" title=""/>
<b>Transport</b>
Spain is a large enough country that it makes sense to travel by plane. Firstly, of course, it takes a very long time to travel by ship to the Balearic and Canary Islands. Planes there are very cheap, and there are many flights from within Spain and from other countries, since both archipelagoes are resorts. Secondly, even on the continent, distances are long from end to end, and flights are inexpensive. I flew from Barcelona to La Coruña and from Bilbao to Barcelona and Alicante. Spain has two of its own low-cost airlines: Vueling and Volotea, and Ryanair also frequently flies on domestic flights. It turned out funny with Volotea - the default carry on allowed there is microscopic (the norm of life for European airlines in 2023, they all lowered their limits to a tiny hand bag). In order to bring a large carry on for free, I took a 2-week subscription for a trial period, because from the moment of purchase to the flight it was less than two weeks. And then I unsubscribed.
Like most European countries, Spain has both trains and buses. There are countries that use 100% only trains - for example, the Netherlands. There are countries where the basis for transportation over medium and short distances is trains, but buses are cheaper over long distances - for example, Germany. There are bus countries where trains are less frequent, slower, and more expensive - for example, Portugal. Well, there are purely bus countries - for example, Croatia. Spain is somewhere in the middle. On the one hand, trains go almost everywhere. On the other hand, departures are far from once an hour (as in Germany), but sometimes 2-3 times a day. Train prices are also usually higher. So I rode buses quite often. I can even draw a diagram like this. Where there are red lines, I traveled by train. Where the blue ones are - by bus. Yellow - flights.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-spain-909244_1000.png" title=""/>
There are regular and high-speed trains. Prices for high-speed trains are set in a very strange way. Let's take the route Madrid - Valladolid as an example. Regular low-speed trains (MD = Media distancia) also run there several times a day, the journey is almost three hours. Costs 25 euros. The high-speed train takes only 1 hour. Some high-speed ones (code AVANT) cost a stable 31 euros. Others (AVE) can be as low as 22, if booked very early, otherwise it is 50+. And the third ones (ALVIA) always cost around 50. At the same time, the travel time does not differ.
From Madrid to Barcelona it takes 2.5 hours by high-speed train. A full-fare ticket costs 90-100 euros, but if you buy it way in advance (more than two weeks in advance), then the promo rate is only 18, which is cheaper than by plane (especially considering how much you also need to pay to get to the airport).
There are no high-speed trains from Barcelona to Valencia. A direct train, which takes three hours, costs as much as 60-70 euros (or 30-40, if much in advance). There is a cheap train that takes 6 hours, only once a day, for 30 euros. It is better to travel this route by bus.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-spain-909607_1000.jpg" title=""/>

Bus stations are usually close to railway stations, or even in the same place. The largest company is called ALSA (alsa.es), it operates throughout the country. There are others, sometimes you look for a ticket on the ALSA website, and when you buy it, it redirects to the website of another company. There is a more universal site movelia.es, for example there are bus tickets from Logrono to Bilbao on it. Bus prices are not always the same - if you buy in advance, it may be cheaper. As with trains, it means at least two weeks in advance - then you may get the minimum fare. Below are prices for the full tariff, which are always available. The minimum fare is 5 euros for each of these destinations. That is, yes, you can get from Madrid to Barcelona for 5 euros.
Madrid - Valladolid 17.50 (2.5 hours)
Barcelona - Valencia 33 (4 hours)
Madrid - Barcelona 37 (7-8 hours)

Within cities in Spain, fares are generally flat. That is, a ticket for the Barcelona metro is valid throughout the network (you need to insert it at the entrance through the turnstiles). In Barcelona, ​​I always bought a ticket for 10 trips, now this costs 11.35 (and as much as 2.40 for one trip). Not everyone knows that with such a ticket you can get to the airport, but only by commuter train (the metro has a separate entrance and you need to buy a more expensive ticket there).
There is a zone system when traveling longer distances on suburban trains (cercanias), but for tourists this is not important, in fact you just buy a single ticket from the machine, it must be pressed against the turnstile at the entrance and exit.
There are metro systems in Madrid, Barcelona, ​​Bilbao, Valencia, Seville, and Palma de Mallorca.

<b>Accomodation</b>
Hotel prices in Spain vary greatly depending on the city and season. In an average town, even in 2023, it is quite possible to stay in a simple hotel (hostal or residencia) for 20-25 euros. In the old days it was a little cheaper, even in Barcelona in winter, but now in the most popular cities prices are higher. Barcelona is definitely the worst city in this regard; I categorically don’t recommend going there in the summer; you can go there in the winter, but you’ll also have to look.
Typical Spanish cheap hotel:

<b>Food</b>
Spain is famous for its meat and dairy products, first of all, of course, jamon (cured pork ham). A kilogram of jamon now costs somewhere between 13-14 euros. You can buy already cut pieces in vacuum packaging, which can be stored for a long time. Every return from Spain looks something like this for me:
<img alt="" src="images/guide-spain-907601_1000.jpg" title=""/>
I will do a detailed review of a grocery supermarket a little later. In general, Spain is noticeably cheaper than Germany or Italy, although inflation in recent years has, of course, also been quite high.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-spain-909442_1000.jpg" title=""/>
When it comes to restaurants, Spain is also one of the most accessible countries in Western Europe. And the point is not only in the general price level, but also in the peculiarities of the local culture - special small portions (tapas) are common here, thanks to which you can try many dishes for little money.
In Spain, the main meal time is lunch. At lunch, many restaurants and tapas bars offer dishes and combo menus, around 10-15 euros. Between lunch and dinner, most places close for a break, like in Italy (but the break itself is shorter, everything opens back around 6-7, not at 9). In principle, you can also eat in the evening, but locals go mainly to drink wine, with a small snack at most. This is especially noticeable in less touristic cities. In touristy cities restuarants often work without breaks.
The dishes themselves, as a rule, have simple descriptive names, something like “shrimp”, “ribs in mushroom sauce”. Here is the menu of a good restaurant with low prices (by the way, in the very touristy city of Alicante):
<img src="images/guide-spain-53423414519_abf15afb00_o.jpg"/>
<img src="images/guide-spain-53423252123_b972ab81c9_o.jpg"/>

For comparison, this menu is from 2016 (Seville). Out of curiosity, I googled the menu of this establishment now, and even the design hasn’t changed. 6.50 became 8.25.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-spain-910387_1000.jpg" title=""/>

The most characteristic purely Spanish snack is deep-fried mashed potatoes (croquetas). Spanish soups are also easily recognizable due to the high content of tomatoes, both hot (sopa castellana) and cold (gazpacho).
<img alt="" src="images/guide-spain-910103_1000.jpg" title=""/>

The Basque Country has its own special tradition. Instead of tapas, there are pintxos - these are small sandwiches with different interesting combinations. And they cost around 2 euros each, in principle, for 10 euros you can have a tasty and even quite filling lunch this way.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-spain-907785_1000.jpg" title=""/>
Another well-known dish is paella - rice with spices on a very large frying pan. Typically with seafood, but not necessarily. This dish is from the Valencia region; it is also found in the center and north, but not everywhere.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-spain-907435_1000.jpg" title=""/>
Some regions have their own special features. I have already mentioned the Basque Country. In Galicia they cook octopus, and in neighboring Asturias I discovered the most satisfying dish ever - called cachopo. Usually you take pepper and add a little minced meat to it. But here it’s the other way around - they take a huge thin piece of meat and “stuff it” with peppers, mushrooms and other things.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-spain-909834_1000.jpg" title=""/>
<b>What to see</b>
Spain is made up of 17 regions ("autonomous communities"), and I've been to all of them. There are two separate “autonomous cities”: Ceuta and Melilla, located in northern Africa on the coast of Morocco - I have not been to these cities. Autonomous communities are divided into smaller provinces, of which I was in about half.

<b>Madrid</b> is the capital and, oddly enough, the largest city in Spain. Of all the capitals of Western Europe, it is probably the least popular, however the city is beautiful, diverse, and at the same time it is not as expensive as in other capitals, it is clean and comfortable.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-spain-902915_1000.jpg" title=""/>
The metropolitan region also includes some nearby cities, three of which are included in the Unesco World Heritage (UWH) list: Alcala de Henares, Aranjuez and the Royal Palace of El Escorial.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-spain-902030_1000.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Castile-La Mancha</b> is a large and rather deserted region south of Madrid. There is essentially only one really important city here, but what a city it is - Toledo (UWH).
<img alt="" src="images/guide-spain-906555_1000.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Castile and Leon</b> is the largest region, north of Madrid. Main cities: Segovia - ancient Roman city (UWH)
<img alt="" src="images/guide-spain-905089_1000.jpg" title=""/>
Valladolid is the capital of the region.
Leon is a city where bars give free snacks. The center of the historical region of Leon, where they have their own language.

<img alt="" src="images/guide-spain-901590_1000.jpg" title=""/>
There are also interesting cities from UWH such as Salamanca and Avila
<b>Andalusia</b> - southern Spain. People here dance flamenco and love bullfighting (by the way, I’ve never been to a bullfight, because they only take place in the summer, and I’ve mostly been to Spain in the winter).
Seville is the capital with the epic Plaza de España (UWH) complex.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-spain-905418_1000.jpg" title=""/>

Algeciras - ferries to Morocco go from here.
La Linea is a town on the border with Gibraltar.

In this region, my main omission is Cordoba, which has almost more Arab heritage than Granada.

Merida is the capital and there are ancient Roman ruins (UWH).
<img alt="" src="images/guide-spain-903327_1000.jpg" title=""/>
Badajoz is the largest city, right on the border with Portugal.
In the northern part there is the interesting city of Caceres.
<b>Catalonia</b> is by far the most popular region. It has ambitions for independence and its own separate language, which is somewhere in the middle between Spanish and French.
Barcelona is the most popular city, which leads to its disadvantages: very expensive housing and a high crime rate. Antoni Gaudi worked here.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-spain-900900_1000.jpg" title=""/>

<b>Valencia</b> is a coastal region south of Catalonia. They speak the same or very similar language.
Valencia is the capital and a very interesting city. Those who want to live by the sea in a big city, but are not ready to pay for Barcelona, ​​usually settle here.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-spain-906938_1000.jpg" title=""/>
Sagunt, Xativa, Castellon de la Plana are good places for a day trip from Valencia.
Alicante is a large city in the south of the region, next to one of the most popular resorts - Benidorm.

Logroño is the capital and only major city.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-spain-902678_1000.jpg" title=""/>

<img alt="" src="images/guide-spain-904600_1000.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Asturias</b> is a mountainous region in the north with landscapes reminiscent of alpine meadows.
Oviedo is the capital. Very ancient medieval churches (UWH) have been preserved here, since the Arabs were unable to subjugate this region in the 8th century.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-spain-903829_1000.jpg" title=""/>
Gijon is the largest city on the ocean.
Aviles is the third city in the metropolitan area.

The other two islands are the lesser-known Menorca, and party place Ibiza.
<b>Canary Islands</b> are islands in the far southwest off the coast of Morocco. They are famous for their excellent climate and volcanic landscapes.
Tenerife is the most popular island. It contains the capital (Santa Cruz), the historical capital (La Laguna, UWH) and the coolest national park, where you can climb almost to the very top of the Teide volcano (UWH), and look at the clouds from above.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-spain-906344_1000.jpg" title=""/>
Gran Canaria is the second large island, there is a second capital (Las Palmas) and also many beautiful mountain landscapes and canyons that are difficult to visit by public transport.
