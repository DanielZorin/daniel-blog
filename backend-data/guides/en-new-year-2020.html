It's time to take a look back at 2020. It’s clear that the year was not very good. Still, I think 2014 was worse than 2020: then there was a catastrophe only in our country, and now throughout the world, against the background of which we are far from being at the very bottom.

In 2020, I spent 132 days traveling - just under half the year. I visited <b>13 countries</b>, of which <b>5 new ones</b>: <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/new%20caledonia">New Caledonia</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/vanuatu">Vanuatu</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/samoa">Samoa</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/cook%20islands">Cook Islands</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag /french%20polynesia">French Polynesia</a>.

I visited other <b>8 countries</b> again:
<a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/russia">Russia</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/japan">Japan</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/fiji">Fiji</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/australia">Australia</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/usa">USA</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/taiwan"> Taiwan</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/malaysia">Malaysia</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/thailand">Thailand</a>

There were as many as 10 long-distance trips across Russia this year, I visited many regions, mostly repeatedly: Moscow, Moscow region, St. Petersburg, Leningrad region, Tatarstan, Altai, Altai region, Ryazan region, Tula region, Tver region, Vologda region region, Arkhangelsk region, Komi, Voronezh region, Krasnodar region, Sverdlovsk region.
The total number of Russian regions visited has reached 75, that is, exactly 10 remain.

In addition, I have almost completed the list of historical cities of Russia - I visited 10 more (Chistopol, Kasimov, Krapivna, Torzhok, Ostashkov, Toropets, Totma, Veliky Ustyug, Solvychegodsk, Verkhoturye) and now only 3 out of 43 remain.

This year I stayed overnight in 43 different places while traveling, mostly in hotels rather than airbnbs. I have only used apartments in Japan, Oceania and once in the USA. Airbnb doesn't really work in Russia, that's why it's like that.

During the year I took <a href="http://flightdiary.net/danielzorin">38 <b>flights</b></a>, which is less than last record year, but far from the lowest figure, for example, higher than 2015 and only 1 lower than 2016.

I don’t have high hopes for 2021: we have clearly seen how incompetent and clumsy even rich and prosperous states are. Since vaccines in Europe and the United States will not reach the majority of the population soon, the show will go on. The only thing I timidly hope for is that they will open land borders, otherwise now many countries in Latin America and Africa are open, but only by plane, which complicates and increases the cost of already difficult logistics.

Happy New Year, gentlemen!
