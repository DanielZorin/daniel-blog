I wanted to take a quick look at West Africa. West Africa is relatively close to Europe, and some people even travel there by land, starting with Morocco. At first, everything is relatively easy, but not everyone will get to Nigeria. There are several countries in West Africa where you do not need a visa, or you can get one online, but they alternate with visa ones: Benin, Togo, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, Senegal, Gambia, Mauritania. Countries far from the sea (Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger) are now practically closed to travel due to conflicts. Flying around West Africa is very expensive, for example, a ticket from Cameroon to Benin cost about $500 (although it is quite close), ideally you need to travel overland, but this takes at least two months done properly. I went to the most accessible and popular country in the region - Senegal, and also to the neighboring small Gambia and the Cape Verde islands, where you need to fly in any case.

<b>Visa</b>
The easiest one is Cape Verde. It is visa free, you just need to pay about 30 euros in fees. There are two options: fill out a form on the website and pay by card, or do not do this and pay in cash upon arrival. The website sternly stated that you "must" fill out the form, and five days before departure no less. I forgot about it and filled it out two days before, the payment went through and I immediately received confirmation. Upon arrival, it turned out that there were very few people like me, and most were standing in line to pay in cash. I was sent to the automatic gates, where I scanned my passport and that was it. It was the first time I entered a foreign country without passport control with a live officer. I had encountered this in the UAE, but there it only worked with repeat visits (you passed a live border guard once, and then you can go through automatic terminals for three months). However, when leaving, they ended up stamping my passport. 
Senegal is supposedly visa-free. If you look at the requirements map, there are three categories: no visa required (rich European countries, the USA, Japan, etc., as well as West African countries), visa on arrival (almost all other African countries, Russia, China, and also, for some reason, Australia and Argentina), and visa required (for some reason, the countries of the former Yugoslavia, Arab countries, and most South American countries). I arrived at Dakar airport, went to passport control, gave my passport. The border guard scanned it, took my fingerprints, stamped it, and let me through. After the border guards there was another check, where the officer looked through my passport and said that I needed to get a visa, sent me to the counter next to the border guards. There they gave me a visa in the form of a stamp on the entire page, where they wrote the data with a pen. They didn't ask for any money. When I entered by land from Gambia, the border guard just put a stamp, didn't even leaf through to the page with the visa. As far as I understand, such a visa can be obtained for free at Senegalese embassies. And those who travel by land are usually advised to do so in Morocco, since at land borders they may not let you in or extort bribes if you do not have a visa, and the most popular northern border with Mauritania is especially famous for this. 
There is even more chaos with Gambia. On the official websites of their Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Tourism, Russia is somewhere on the list of visa-free countries, and somewhere it is not. In Timatic it is written that you can enter without a visa, so I was guided by this and flew by plane. There are very unpleasant stories about the land border, that they extort terribly there, because Gambia is a very corrupt country. Upon arrival, seeing that I did not have a visa, they took me to a side room to the boss. He gave me a form to fill out and told me to pay $120. I suppose the price is set by eye based on your appearance, and I entered with a passport that had old visas to the USA, Canada, UK, etc. I'll note that a woman with an American passport from my flight was also taken to this room, so "visa-free" in Gambia seems to be rather conditional. 
Another interesting moment, when I was leaving Gambia, about 15 kilometers before the border, there was a checkpoint. There, the men from our collective taxi were sent for inspection (women and children were ignored). I had the largest backpack, which the officers inspected in great detail for drugs, pulling everything out to the very bottom. When they found a bag of medicine at the bottom, they said that in Gambia you must have a prescription for all medicines, tsk-tsk-tsk. I read about this scam, that they extort money like this when entering from Senegal at customs. I reacted in a very indifferent manner, like "oh no sir, it can't be". And in the end they didn't insist, they just gave me all my things and let me go.

<b>Base</b>
The sockets in Senegal and Cape Verde are European (in Senegal they are French with a pin). In Gambia they are British.
The language in Senegal is French, in Gambia - English, in Cape Verde - Portuguese.
The currency of Senegal is called the CFA franc, like in Cameroon, but it is the West African franc (also used in Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Ivory Coast, Togo and Benin). It has the code XOF instead of XAF, and the rate is exactly the same - about 600 to the dollar. There are 10,000, 5,000, 2,000, 1,000, 500 notes and 100 and 50 coins. Unlike Cameroon, there are no big problems with change, 100f coins are common enough. It is better to exchange cash euros rather than dollars - the exchange rate is much better, especially at the airport.

The currency of Gambia is called dalasi. For 1 euro, exchange offices usually give 70 dalasi.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946289843_1b2c64f0d9_h.jpg"/>
The currency of Cape Verde is called escudo (just like in Portugal before the euro). The rate is 1 euro ~ 110 escudos, but everyone counts by 100. There are bills for 2000, 1000, 500, 200 escudos, coins 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 1. There is a big commission for exchange at the airport (about 5%), in the city the banks were already closed, the exchange rate was even worse from hands. I withdrew from an ATM, apparently, without additional commission.

<b>Transport</b>
In West Africa, the main transport is a collective taxi, also known as bush taxi. In Senegal, they are called sept place ("seven places") in French. In Senegal, there are also large buses that are cheaper, but they are packed as usual in Africa.
I paid 6,000 francs ($10) for a ride on a sept place from the border with Gambia to Mbour, and 1,700 francs ($3) from Mbour to Dakar. I took a bus from Mbour to the Bandia Reserve, and paid 500 francs. It seems that those who took this bus to Dakar paid 1,000.
There used to be a train from Dakar to Mali, but not anymore. You can get to the southern part of Senegal (Casamance) by ferry overnight, bypassing Gambia, but it is easier to fly there, the ticket costs about 60 dollars.

In Dakar, there is a taxi app Yango, I used it, although if you have more time, you can use public transport: it is quite civilized, there is one suburban train line (which they are going to extend to the airport), and many metrobus lines. There is an express bus to the airport from the stadium for 6000, and I think from the final station of the trains for 3000. Expensive, but the airport is very far away, more than 50 km from the city. A taxi from the airport at 1am cost me 22,000 francs ($36), and in the city I paid 2,000-4,000 (distances are also long).
In Gambia, public transport is ridesharing and shared taxis. On busy roads, taxi drivers themselves call out passengers (for example, at the ferry in Banjul and Barra). When I went to the beach, I noticed that locals just get into passing cars that do not look like taxis or minibuses. In the end, I got to the beach for 15 dalasi ($0.20). From the ferry to the border with Senegal it costs 100 dalasi ($1.5).

In Cape Verde, I was only on the capital island. There are regular buses running around Praia, and I think they even have travel cards to pay for them. There are minibuses (called aluguer in Portuguese) running outside the city, and they look pretty decent. A ride from Praia to Cidade Velha costs 100 escudos ($1). There are ferries between the islands, but not very often; it's easier to fly. Flights are also not as frequent as on the neighboring Canary Islands, and they're not very cheap.

<b>Accommodation</b>
Accommodation is quite expensive, and there is not much of it compared to East Africa. It was terrible in Senegal in Mbour, when I tried to find a hotel in the area of ​​the bus station, and found it with great difficulty, asking taxi drivers. The hotel was just awful, the water did not work, instead they gave me a canister. At least there was air conditioning. And the price was $ 35, the most expensive hotel on this trip. In Dakar it was the same, but at least the room was good. Dakar is such a huge city that it was not very clear to me where the hotels could be concentrated (the bus station, for example, is about 30 kilometers from the center, and there is nothing around it either). In the end, I chose a hotel on Booking in the area not far from the buses to the airport. <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946244573_6633bb0c30_h.jpg"/>
In Gambia and Cape Verde I paid about $25 per room, without air conditioning, though, and it would have been nice since the weather was hot.

<b>Food</b>
I wasn't impressed with the food in Senegal. The main dish is called Yassa. It's basically just fried chicken with vegetables and rice.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946407690_9f7d916af9_h.jpg"/>
There's also Thiebou soup, which I've only seen for sale on Gorée Island. Restaurants are a bit scarse, especially outside of downtown Dakar. In Mbour, I had a hard time finding any place where I could get even chicken with rice. Near my hotel in a seemingly good area, I only found a fast food place called Djolof chicken. In general, Djolof is also a local dish (or Nigerian), but this fast food is essentially just an analogue of KFC.

Prices in a cheap restaurant in the center of Dakar:
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946210493_e462c7ede9_h.jpg"/>
There are large supermarkets in Senegal, including Auchan, and you can buy imports from Europe.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946210613_ed2115839b_h.jpg"/>
In Gambia, on the contrary, there were many restaurants, probably because I lived near the US embassy. There are also many restaurants in the beach area. Prices are not particularly low by African standards, dishes for $7:
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946486140_e9bd4bbe4a_h.jpg"/>
The national dish of Gambia is domada, meat in peanut sauce, quite tasty.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946289808_853ca356d3_h.jpg"/>
In Cape Verde there are many restaurants on the central pedestrian street, like in Europe. Prices are lower than in Europe, but higher than in Africa - a meal costs 8-10 euros. In stores, prices are also noticeably higher than in Senegal, since these are islands.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946487505_6595e6432f_h.jpg"/>
National dish: katxupa - a thick rich soup. If without meat, you can find it in budget places for about 3 euros.

<b>Internet</b>
In Senegal I bought a SIM card from the Free operator for 1000 francs ($1.5), another 1000 francs is for a 1.5 GB package for a week. I bought the SIM card unexpectedly on the island of Goree. At the airport they wanted 10,000 francs for the SIM card.
In Gambia, the Africell SIM card is free at the airport, you just need to top up your account. I took a package for 180 dalasi ($2.5) for 3 GB.
I didn’t buy a SIM card in Cape Verde, there was a long line at the airport, and in the city they only sell them in offices, and they closed early.

<b>What to see</b>
Dakar is a large, developed and interesting city, the economic center of West Africa.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945948151_b674f5d793_h.jpg"/>
I haven't been to any bad areas (except the bus station), but the good ones look pretty good. The nicest area is near Cape Almadies, the westernmost point of Africa.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945947821_d7cab49e52_h.jpg"/>
From the center of Dakar, you can take a ferry to Gorée Island, a place from where slaves were sent to America, a World Heritage Site. The ferry for foreigners costs 5,700. You need to come early - I thought that if I came at 9:30, I would get on the ferry at 10:00. In the end, I had to wait for the next ferry at 12:00, and they started letting us into the waiting room at about 10:45.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946210763_e04a01bbf4_h.jpg"/>
Mbour is a terrible city, supposedly there is a beach, but it is dirty.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945082547_85fd385740_h.jpg"/>
Bandia Nature Reserve is near Mbour (the entrance is directly from the Mbour-Dakar highway, so it is easy to get there by bus). A good reserve, there are rhinos, buffalos, giraffes, zebras, antelopes, ostriches. Entrance costs 18 euros (12,000 francs), car rental with a guide is about 70 euros, but there are a lot of people, and I easily found someone to split the cost with, in the end I paid 40 euros for everything - the cheapest safari.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946214138_2a619ae5ba_h.jpg"/>
There is another similar reserve Fathala, it is right on the border with Gambia, from where tourists are brought.
Of the cities, Saint-Louis in the north (the colonial capital) and Ziguinchor in the south (where everyone gets a visa to Guinea-Bissau) are interesting.

Gambia stretches along the river of the same name, squeezed on both sides by Senegal. Oddly enough, tourists from Europe fly to Gambia for a beach holiday, there are even charter flights. Along the Atlantic coast there is a chain of beaches, within the cities of Serekunda and Sukuta. There are many large hotels along them, and there is some infrastructure like restaurants and travel agencies, like in Turkey.

Banjul is the capital, a small city on an island in the river. Ferries leave from here to the northern shore, if you need to go towards Dakar (there is a bridge, but it is a long way inland).
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945051337_5a4ca68aa8_h.jpg"/>
Cape Verde a.k.a. Cabo Verde is one of the most touristic countries in Africa, it doesn't look like Africa, it looks very nice and advanced. Lots of beautiful harsh desert landscapes.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946408250_2531f46138_h.jpg"/>
Praia is the capital.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946487420_98e6e69552_h.jpg"/>
Cidade Velha is the old capital, a World Heritage Site.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946286354_91ae328e53_h.jpg"/>
Tourists from Europe usually come not to the capital island, but to the island of Sal, where more flights from Europe arrive (from Africa they fly to the capital). Another popular island is Sao Vicente, where the cultural capital Mindelo is located. Cruise ships call at Mindelo.

<b>Expenses</b>
West Africa turned out to be the most expensive section of the trip by all parameters.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945069867_c37548b1f7_h.jpg"/>

Total expenses for the entire trip through 11 African countries, including flights. In total, after deducting flights and visas, it came to $60 per day, including all sorts of safaris, a bunch of taxis, etc. In general, East Africa is probably one of the last bastions of cheapness on our planet, along with Southeast Asia and the post-Soviet countries.
