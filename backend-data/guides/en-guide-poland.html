Last week I took a short trip around Europe to visit some previously undeservedly overlooked places and see what it’s like in Europe with euros at 75 rubles.
The route was like this:

The <b>Flight</b> cost approximately 11 thousand rubles (for two). There - Moscow-Berlin, Transaero, tickets for about 2500, back - Budapest-Moscow, WizzAir, tickets for 36 euros (11,000 forints), plus one baggage. I bought tickets at the end of December, after Black Tuesday.

Travel from Berlin to Krakow is easy to arrange. Polskibus is cheap and convenient, tickets need to be purchased online, just write the reservation code on a piece of paper. The buses have sockets and Wi-Fi, which, however, sometimes does not work well.
Getting to Slovakia is a trickier task, I had to do a lot of Googling to figure out this route. First you need to get to the ski resort of Zakopane, buses from Krakow go there every 15 minutes. Opposite the Zakopane bus station there are minibuses, just like ours. As they fill up, they travel to different places. To the border - direction to Morskie Oko, this is a very popular place, a lake in the mountains. The minibus reaches the parking lot, from where it is about 10 kilometers to the lake on foot. The border is located about 1 kilometer before the parking lot. From the border on the Slovak side there are buses to the nearest large city of Poprad, the bus passes through all the resort villages in the Carpathians. Buses run at least once an hour, the ride takes an hour and a half.
The last difficult section is Kosice-Budapest. In principle, it’s a million times better here than with <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/tag/slovenia">Slovenia</a>. The direct train runs twice a day. There are two pitfalls. The first is a very inconvenient schedule, either at 6 am or 6 pm. Secondly, the price, here again they force you to buy a round-trip ticket for &gt;22 euros; a one-way ticket will be more expensive. You can try to buy a ticket to Miskolc, and then transfer to the next Hungarian train, then the price will be about 19-20 euros, but I decided that walking around Miskolc at 7 am is somehow not very good and it’s easier to go by car using the blablacar service. com, fortunately there was an offer there at a convenient time - at noon.

<b>Housing</b>
In Eastern Europe, housing is still cheap.
It's a bit more expensive in Berlin. Approximate prices are 30 euros on the outskirts, 40 euros in the center, for a double room. Since travel on the Berlin metro is not cheap, I decided not to save a penny and stay in the center, a total of 117 euros for three days (Hotel ABM Berlin).
In Poland, a private room costs an average of 20 euros. Specifically in Wroclaw - 70 zlotys per day, in Krakow 323 zlotys for three days (you can find it cheaper further from the center, in this case this is a good idea, because travel by tram costs only 4 zlotys).
In Kosice the room cost 28 euros.

<i>Lunch for three euros</i>

<b>Food</b>
Now, in reality, food in Europe has become cheaper than in Russia, especially “sanctioned” products. In our country, a kilogram of cheese costs at least 600 rubles, there it is 300-400. Those same Polish apples cost one and a half to two zlotys (30-40 rubles) per kilogram. The best store in Poland is Biedronka (Ladybug).
In Poland, the best places to eat are canteens, or, as they are called here, milk bars (Bar Mleczny). In such establishments, lunch costs about 2-3 euros; at the same time you can try Polish dishes, such as Zurek soup for 2-4 zlotys or stewed cabbage with Bigos meat for 5-6 zlotys.
In Poland they sell branded local smoked cheese (Oscypki), in Zakopane at the market I bought them for 1 zloty per piece (in Krakow it will cost 2).

<b>Results</b>
Total costs for 9 days were $574, $64 per day (for two people). In Poland, the average cost was less - $55 per day.
About half of the cost is housing ($280 for 9 nights). 30% went towards travel ($175). Food is the smallest expense item, 13% or $8 per day, this includes five bottles of German and Slovak wine that were brought to Moscow (though there were small supplies of small snacks, but it is unlikely that without them there would have been more than $10 per day). 7% was spent on the rest, mainly on tickets to museums, as well as on luggage storage (1-2 euros in Poland).
The total cost in rubles including the flight was approximately 45,000, and it would have been possible to save more. A year ago, the cost of such a trip would have been 35 thousand.
In general, those who could previously travel to Western Europe will now be able to afford to travel to Eastern Europe. Hurry before prices for air tickets shoot up exponentially, and this will happen very soon, judging by how empty Moscow airports have been in recent months.</lj-cut>
