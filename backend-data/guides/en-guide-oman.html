Continuing my travels in the Middle East, I again visited the Persian Gulf region. I have already been to both countries before, although both trips to the UAE were very short, and I slipped into Oman for <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/554139.html">less than an hour</a>. People often write that Oman is dull and there is nothing to see, and in the UAE everything is artificial and there are only fake skyscrapers. To be honest, I wrote this myself <a href="http://goo.gl/viHWwq">10 years ago</a>, but now my opinion has changed - both countries are very interesting and picturesque, definitely worth visiting no less than <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/734945.html">Saudi Arabia</a>.

<b>Entry</b>
Entry into the UAE with a Russian passport is visa-free for 90 days.
Entry into Oman was recently made visa-free for 14 days. Previously, you had to pay either 5 rials ($13) for 10 days, or 20 rials for 30 days. I read that at the land border they may still require you to pay for a visa on arrival, but they just gave me a stamp for 14 days for free.
From the UAE, I went to the Omani exclave of Musandam for one day with an excursion, passports were checked only once at entry and once at exit, but no stamps were put, the tour operator prepared some papers and copies of passports, some of the papers were taken away at the entrance, the rest on the way out.

<b>Money</b>
The UAE currency is called the dirham (AED), its exchange rate is pegged to the US dollar: $1 = 3.67 AED. Banknotes from 5 to 500 dirhams are used, and coins of 1 dirham (often) and 0.50 and 0.25 (rarely)
The currency of Oman is called the rial (OMR). The rate is also pegged to the dollar: 1 OMR = $2.6. A little less than the Bahraini dinar, but still a lot, which is a little confusing, since all the prices seem small. Banknotes (0.10, 0.50, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 rials) are used almost exclusively, but there are also coins (0.05, 0.025).

<b>Internet</b>
Internet in the UAE is very expensive, a SIM card with a package of only 2 GB costs 50 dirhams ($13), for 6 GB you have to pay 100 dirhams.
In Oman it is a little cheaper - 4 rials ($10) for 2 gigabytes.

<b>Accomodation</b>
Housing in the UAE is more expensive than in other Gulf countries. In Dubai and Abu Dhabi, a hotel room costs closer to $50 (but a very nice room). Cheaper, around $30, you can rent rooms on airbnb in apartments converted into hotels, the rooms there are very small, almost like in Hong Kong, as they squeeze out the space to the maximum. In Sharjah, housing is cheaper; you can find hotels around $30. I assume that in more distant emirates there is also cheaper housing.
<i>Hotel in Dubai for $50</i>

In Oman, hotels are cheaper, approximately at the prices of Saudi Arabia - you can find something for at least 25-30 dollars, for 40-50 you can get something really luxurious.

<b>Urban transport</b>
In Dubai, to travel by transport you need a NOL card, which costs 6 AED. There are seven zones in Dubai, but three are relevant for tourists: 1) Deira + airport 2) Jumeirah (up to and including the Dubai Mall) 3) From the Mall of the Emirates to the Marina. A trip within one zone costs 3 dirhams, between two zones 5, more than two zones - 7.5 dirhams. You can also use your NOL card to pay for intercity buses to Sharjah, Ajman and even Abu Dhabi.
In Abu Dhabi you need to buy your own Hafilat card, which costs as much as 10 AED. But the fares are lower - bus travel costs at least 2 AED, from a certain point it starts adding 0.05 for each kilometer. From the airport to the bus station it costs approximately 3.5 dirhams.
Sharjah and Ajman have their own local buses, but I didn't use them.
Muscat has a relatively large bus network, but I didn't use it.

Often, for speed or because there was no alternative, I took a taxi. Uber operates in the UAE, but strangely enough, using it is more expensive than catching a regular taxi with a meter. According to the meter, the tariff in all cities is approximately the following: 5 dirhams flagfall + 2 dirhams for each kilometer. This is several times cheaper than in the USA and Western Europe, comparable to Turkey, but more expensive than Saudi Arabia. The absolute cost figures are quite large, since the distances in cities are huge.
In all taxis the meter worked without problems, which was nice. The only emirate where there are no taxi meters at all is Umm al-Quwain, but the price was about the same or even cheaper.
Neither Uber nor Careem operate in Oman, but there is a local Otaxi app, a short trip costs the standard 1.50 rials, from the bus station to the old city - 2.40.

<b>Intercity transport</b>
The UAE has a network of intercity buses. It is logical that most routes start from Dubai, since it is in the middle.
From Abu Dhabi there are very frequent direct buses to Dubai (34 AED), less frequently to Sharjah and a couple of times a day to Ras Al Khaimah.
City buses run from Dubai to Sharjah and Ajman every 15 minutes (payment by NOL card). To Ajman, for example, 8.50 AED.
RAK bus company runs from Dubai to Ras Al Khaimah every hour. The price is 20 AED, you need to buy a ticket with a seat at the box office or through a separate application.
There are only two routes in Umm Al Quwain: either RAK - Dubai/Ajman buses, which drop off on the highway 15 km from the city, or a bus to Ajman every 50 minutes from Lulu Shopping Center (15 AED).
Only Al Khanjry buses now run from Dubai to Muscat (Oman), a ticket costs 100 AED, and you can only buy it in person at the office. Departures are three times a day: 7, 15, 19 hours. The journey should have taken 6-7 hours, but I spent 10, since a couple of passengers were interrogated by customs officers at the border for three hours.

In Oman, intercity transport is provided by Mwasalat; on their website you can view the schedule and buy tickets. Buses are not very frequent, for example to Sohar/Buraimi only three times a day, to Nizwa - once or twice a day. There are also shared taxis in Oman, which are probably more convenient for moving between cities.
I rented a car in Oman, so I hardly used public transport.

<b>Food</b>
Although the UAE and Oman are technically Arab countries, it is much easier to find Indian food there than Arabic. Even when I was driving and went to a restaurant near a gas station, the food on the menu was mostly Indian.
It is also easy to find other Asian cuisines in the UAE - Chinese, Japanese, Thai, and even Filipino (there are a lot of people from there). The prices, however, are a bit steep - at the food court, meals cost under $10, just like lunch at McDonald's. Areas like Deira are cheaper, but they are not always nearby when you are a tourist and go to tourist places.

It's noticeably cheaper in Oman. Even when I went to a more respectable restaurant (there were waiters in suits, and separate rooms for visitors, like in Saudi departments for families), the most expensive dishes there cost around 3-3.5 rials ($8-10), and in a regular restaurant chicken with Omani Qabuli rice costs 1-1.5 rials.

In a grocery store in Dubai, according to my observations, prices are almost exactly twice as high as in Turkey. I can’t say for sure about Oman, since I never went to a store with price tags there.

<b>What to see</b>
The United Arab Emirates consists of seven emirates. Six of them are on the west coast, one (Fujairah) is on the east, in addition, the lands on the east coast are finely divided between the remaining emirates. Every emirate must have a small ancient fort.
Abu Dhabi is the capital, there is a large airport (from which the low-cost Wizz Air has recently been flying to many countries in the Middle East and Central Asia), the largest mosque, a Formula 1 track, a branch of the Louvre (a whole complex of art museums is being built), moderate number of skyscrapers.

Fujairah is a city on the west coast.
Dibba is the second major city on the west coast. There is a border with the exclave of Oman. Interestingly, the piece right next to the border belongs to the emirate of Sharjah, and most of the city belongs to Fujairah.

Oman consists of a coastal part, an inland mountainous part, and also a remote part near Yemen, which I have not been to. In the desert part (Dhofar) you could hear rare South Arabian languages ​​related to Arabic.

Musandam is a peninsula north of the UAE, at the entrance to the Persian Gulf. Belongs to Oman. It has steep rocky shores, due to which this place is compared to the fjords of Norway.

Madha is a village inside the emirate of Fujairah, belonging to Oman. It is possible to visit Oman without passport control. Inside Madha there is the Emirati village of Nahwa, which is an exclave within an exclave.
