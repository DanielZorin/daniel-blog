This spring I made a big trip to Brazil - the largest country in South America and one of the largest in the world. This country certainly deserves to be explored in detail, like Russia, China, India or the USA, so I am pleased that I was able to travel extensively, even if I had to postpone a trip to other South American countries where I wanted to go.
The last time I was in Brazil was during the New Year holidays in 2012-2013, then I traveled from Rio de Janeiro south to the border with Uruguay through the southern states. This time I did not go to the south, but I traveled through the northeast, the Amazon, the center of the country and the Pantanal, and also spent a lot of time in the two main cities - Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. In total, this year I was in Brazil for about 70 days, from March 2 to June 3, with a break for a trip to <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/658551.html">Bolivia</a>.

<b>Entry and exit</b>
Brazil is visa-free, formally 90 days out of 180 (like Europe), but in fact your stay can be extended for another 90 days. To enter, you need a coronavirus test, usually 72 hours in advance.
If you need a coronavirus test to enter the next country, in Brazil it is easiest to do it at Sao Paulo airport (international flights only fly from there now anyway). It is not cheap - 350 reais ($65), but cheaper than in Bolivia or Europe. The results are ready in 4 hours, which means you can arrive at the airport early on the same day. There are also a couple of places in the city of the same network, but they get results within 1 day.
From Europe to Brazil now the main routes are through Istanbul (cheaper) or through Doha/Dubai (more expensive). It is not worth flying through EU airports (Paris, Amsterdam), as they like to change the rules and even close transit on a whim. My ticket from Moscow to Sao Paulo via Istanbul and back cost about $900, that is, about the same as it cost in 2019. At the same time, the tariff had the possibility of exchange, which I took advantage of, probably for the first time in my life, when flights from Istanbul to Moscow were canceled - I changed the date and point of arrival to Minsk, and they even gave me back a few dollars in airport taxes.
Because of the “Brazilian” variant (which is considered more dangerous, although there is still no evidence of this), it is now difficult to get out of Brazil. After Brazil, I wanted to go to Colombia and Ecuador, but both countries imposed quarantine on those arriving from Brazil (Colombia, however, lifted this rule at the end of May, but I no longer wanted to change my plans). Flying through the USA won’t work either; more precisely, you can fly to Brazil (if you have an American visa), but you can’t go back, because... Entry to the United States from Brazil is closed.


<b>Money</b>
The currency of Brazil is called the real. From 2013 to 2021, the real exchange rate fell from 2 reais per dollar to 5.5, as a result, Brazil turned from the most expensive country in South America into the cheapest, at least cheaper than Bolivia. In Brazil, imports are very expensive due to duties, so iPhones and branded clothing are more expensive than even in Russia. But for a tourist this is not important, and food, housing, travel, and excursions fall in price with the exchange rate of the real. Having pulled up my archives, I compared prices with 2013, and realized that in real, travel between cities has risen slightly, travel within the city has risen 1.5 times, food has increased slightly, and hotels have even become cheaper.
In Brazil, payment by bank card is very common; there are also local transfer systems, like our transfers by phone number in Sberbank. Even street food carts can accept cards. This is probably due to the high crime rate, so people don't want to carry cash.
You can withdraw cash from an ATM without a fee at most banks (but not at Sao Paulo Airport), the limit is usually low at around 1000 reais, but at Bank Bradesco in many branches you can withdraw 2500 reais at a time.

<b>Language</b>
In Brazil they speak Portuguese, the pronunciation of which is quite different from Portugal. I speak this language, so I had almost no problems with communication, but in general this is not easy in Brazil - almost no one speaks English, the tourist infrastructure is also focused mainly on locals or residents of neighboring countries, so it’s difficult to meet people who speak English. Spanish is more common.

<b>Accomodation</b>
Hotels in Brazil are quite cheap. I paid an average of 100 reais (less than $20) for a double room, and even less for a single room - 70 reais. This is in a good hotel with air conditioning. Without air conditioning you can find it even cheaper, I stayed in such a place for one night in Joao Pessoa, and it cost only 40 reais ($7), and for the money it was not bad - at least there was a shower in the room and internet. Brazil is not as hot as Southeast Asia, especially in the southern and central parts, especially closer to winter. In May, it seems to me that I almost didn’t turn on the air conditioning anywhere.

Airbnb in Brazil is also quite possible to use. For the same $20-25 you can rent a small apartment, which is very cool. I lived like this twice: in Recife and in Rio de Janeiro, right on the first line of Copacabana. Airbnb is not very convenient for a short stay of 1-2 days, since the apartments are usually in residential areas and not in the historical/business center.
Almost all hotels have free breakfast, a buffet with approximately the same set of dishes everywhere:

<b>Intercity transport</b>
Due to long distances, the most relevant transport is an airplane. There are three major airlines in Brazil: Latam, Gol and Azul. The first is a regular airline, and the other two are low-cost airlines. Luggage is not included in the price anywhere, but it is not monitored upon boarding. Due to the coronavirus, there are no check-in kiosks at airports (it's unclear why, when contamination from surfaces is extremely rare), so I always checked in through the mobile app and showed my boarding pass from my phone. Before entering the plane, you must show your passport (so far, of all the countries, only in Australia and New Zealand I have flown domestic flights without showing any documents at all).
Tickets are quite cheap, but there is one unpleasant feature - you need to buy them much in advance, at least two weeks in advance. Even on the busiest route, Rio de Janeiro - Sao Paulo, where planes fly every half hour, a ticket for tomorrow can cost $100, and in advance - $20. On less popular routes, prices for the next 3 days are almost always high, $200, $300, $400, but in advance you can fly across the whole country for $50-100.
Connecting flights are very common in Brazil, with many different hubs, and often search engines offer non-obvious routes with two or even three transfers.

Intercity trains in Brazil operate on only two routes: Belo Horizonte - Vitoria and Sao Luis - Parauapebas. I didn't have a chance to ride them. The first route is probably better than the bus, but less convenient than the plane, which should be cheap between these two major cities. The second route goes from the coast into the wilds of the Amazon, but can be useful for getting overland from Sao Luis towards the state of Tocantins.

The main ground transport is buses. There is a complete ancap going on here: you come to the bus station, and there are 20 windows of different companies, and you need to understand who is going in the right direction. You can view schedules at <a href="http://buscaonibus.com.br">buscaonibus.com.br</a> or <a href="http://clickbus.com.br">clickbus.com.br</a>. The buses are all comfortable, like in <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/423990.html">Malaysia</a>, you won’t find cheap and old buses like in Bolivia. Due to the coronavirus, bus frequencies have been reduced to many destinations, so it is better to check schedules in advance rather than hoping to leave at any time. Bus fares are approximately 20 reais ($4) per hour.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946230868_13c7e8fc96_h.jpg"/>

Blablacar operates in Brazil and is quite popular. I used it once because I really didn’t want to get up early to get from Salvador to Aracaju. As often happens with this service, there were some incidents - two drivers did not answer me, the third canceled the trip, but still passed on the contacts of another car.
You can travel along the Amazon River by ship. There are also passenger boats along major tributaries, right up to the borders with Peru and Colombia. The main route runs between Manaus (the main city of the Amazon) and Belem (ocean coast, Amazon delta). I sailed a little less than half of this route from Manaus to Santarem. The journey costs 200 reais (for 30 hours), this is if you ride on the deck in a hammock (which you need to buy in advance). For 400 reais on top you can travel in a relatively comfortable cabin with shower and air conditioning.

Finally, renting a car in Brazil is also possible. In theory, international permit is required in Brazil, but in fact they didn’t ask me for it. In Brazil, despite the proximity of America, cars with a manual transmission are quite common, for example, most taxi drivers drive manual. They rent both manual and automatic, and automatics are a little more expensive - about 130 reais per day versus 100. I rented from Alamo (like last time in America), which operates under the Unidas brand in Brazil. Insurance here is paid separately, approximately 10 reais per day for CDW (CASCO) and 15 reais per day for Liability (MTPL). Unlike Europe and the US, where adding a second driver can nearly double the price, here it only costs about a dollar a day.
Gasoline in Brazil is not cheap, unlike in the USA: about 5 reais per liter. Because of this, gas became a significant expense: I paid about $100 for a three-day rental and a little over $50 for gas (gasoline costs were negligible in the US). The rules of the road are standard, drive on the right side. Almost no one follows the speed limit, as in Russia, especially outside cities (where the default limit is 90 km/h, and sometimes they like to put a bump in the middle of nowhere with a limit of 30). I only traveled in Brasilia and the surrounding area, where the roads are wide and parking is plentiful and free. If you decide to go to a large city like Rio or Recife (a dubious decision, in my opinion), parking will be paid. There are unofficial parking attendants who collect parking fees, like in Indonesia.

<b>Urban transport</b>
Oddly enough, my main means of transport in Brazil was a taxi. The Uber (international) and 99 (local) apps operate here. In three months in Brazil I took a taxi more times than in Russia in 30 years. And it’s not just about safety and speed - a taxi is not much more expensive than a bus, even if you’re traveling together. Typically, a trip around the city for 20 minutes costs 10-15 reais ($2-3), in many cities you can even get to the airport for this money. When bus fare per person is 4-5 reais, the choice is obvious. There is no such cheap taxi even in the Russian provinces, not to mention Moscow, where you can’t even get to the next house for less than 200 rubles.
In Sao Paulo, taxis are slightly more expensive than in other cities.
If you are in no hurry, you can use public transport. There are metro in the following cities: Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Recife, Salvador, Brasilia, Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre. All except Sao Paulo have a maximum of 2 lines, but they can also be useful. For example, in Salvador you can get to the center from the airport, in Recife the airport is at the end of one line, the bus station is at the end of another, and both begin in the historical center. In Rio de Janeiro, the metro runs along the coast through all the main places: the center, Lapa, Botafoga, Copacabana, Ipanema, Rocinha, Tijuca. Formally there are 4 lines, but in essence line 4 begins when line 2 ends (in 2013 there was no line 4 yet), and the lines are separated in the north, where there is nothing special for tourists to see. A metro ride costs 4-5 reais; in Rio de Janeiro at the end of May the price increased to 5.80 for a single ticket.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946306289_8994d77174_h.jpg"/>

Travel by bus also costs 4-5 reais (the amounts differ everywhere by a slightly different number of centavos). Directions are available in Google Maps and the Moovit app, it is better to use the latter as it has more accurate information. Brazilian buses have a very inconvenient turnstile at the entrance, even tougher and more inconvenient than those in Moscow. In 2013, as standard, there was a person sitting near the entrance who collected payments, now this still remains in some places (in Belem, Santarem), but in most cities transport cards have been introduced. Almost all locals have them, as they provide significant savings when traveling with a transfer. Because of this, the driver may not have change, once I even gave 5 reais to another passenger so that he would let me through.

<b>Food</b>
Brazil is a very interesting place in terms of food, no less exotic than East Asia. There are many unique fruits and vegetables here that cannot be found on other continents. Lots of room to explore.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946306284_de4a5d2a70_h.jpg"/>

You can try some exotic dishes, the ingredients for which you are unlikely to get outside Brazil, such as Amazonian tacaca soup:
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945068642_f25ddf9077_h.jpg"/>

Supermarkets are quite common, there are even chains from Europe (Dia, Carrefour). The prices there are reasonable, they sell many types of juicy meat, but since the food in the restaurants is inexpensive, I got lazy and didn’t cook, except during the lockdown in Recife.
To eat, the most budget option is lancheria. These establishments sell burgers, sandwiches and lunch dishes (Prato executivo). As a rule, the dish is some kind of meat or fish, plus a side dish, a lot of side dish: the usual rice, beans, crumbs (farofa), lettuce, tomato, sometimes cassava or regular potatoes. Eating at a lancheria costs around 10-15 reais, maximum 25 if there is a lot of meat there. Typically, lancherias are open only during the day, but in busy places like Copacabana they can work until the evening.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946306269_c72b302f46_h.jpg"/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946230768_31f30693b6_h.jpg"/>

Restaurants will be at a higher level. The food there is more varied and a little more refined, although side dishes will also be present. Eating in a restaurant is not much more expensive, about 20-30 reais. Many of them also only open during the day for lunch.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946306329_7291a3791e_h.jpg"/>

Eating in the evening can be a problem, especially now when everything has to close at 9-10. In general, in the evening, restaurants with grills (churrascaria) are most often open, as well as bars, where the emphasis is more on beer than on food (but you can also eat there). One of the features of Brazil is restaurants with no limit (rodizio), where you pay for entry, and inside the waiters walk around the room and carry freshly fried pieces of meat on skewers. Unfortunately, such restaurants are much less common than I would like, and not all are operating now. So, in Brasilia I could not find an acceptable one, there was only one that worked, but it was very expensive (150 reais for entry). So I only went to a real rodizio once in Maceio, where the entrance cost 45 reais.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946230848_8b966704ba_h.jpg"/>

An alternative to unlimited are restaurants where you pay per kilogram (buffet/kilão). You can put whatever you want on your plate, including meat, and pay by weight, usually between 50 and 70 reais per kilo (there are cheaper ones, but they're usually not fun). In Sao Paulo, I always went to this one, there was a grill with the same level of eliteness as in Rodizio, plus all sorts of other non-trivial things like salmon sashimi, carpaccio, ceviche, etc.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945968336_ca9ef437ee_h.jpg"/>

Fast food is quite common in the form of carts selling burgers, tapioca (fried pancakes) or pastel (crispy pies). There are also standard international networks. Lunch at McDonald's with a Big Mac costs about 30 reais, it is better to take a double Big Mac because it is only a couple of reais more expensive. And it’s even better for the two of you to buy two Big Macs (or other large burgers) for 18-20 reais, this turns out to be the same price as in Russia.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945068667_9a06da640c_h.jpg"/>
Brazil is famous for its freshly squeezed juices; I almost always had some kind of juice for lunch. Even in a run-of-the-mill lancheria there will be about 5 types of juice, and in a self-respecting one there will be 20 types from different fruits. Some fruits, such as cupuaçu or caja (or tapereba), are best enjoyed in juice form rather than in pure form. The juice is cheap - 6-10 reais per glass, regardless of the fruit. Can you imagine freshly squeezed juice anywhere else for 1-2 dollars?
A separate form of art is açai - a kind of ice cream or smoothie made from frozen açai berries growing in the Amazon. There are often special açai establishments that specialize in it, but you can also buy it in the supermarket in the ice cream section. A large half-liter glass of açai costs 15 reais in its pure form, but diluted with milk or water will be cheaper.
By the way, the real taste of açai is different, more tart and less fruity. It can only be tasted in the Amazon because the pure juice does not last more than a few hours.

<b>Internet</b>
There are four main operators in Brazil: Claro, Tim, Vivo, and Oi. Internet prices are quite low, but the main problem is that it is very difficult for a foreigner to buy a SIM card without a CPF (Brazilian taxpayer number). In the center of Sao Paulo, I went to all the operator offices (they don’t sell SIM cards at all at the airport), and only Oi agreed to sell it to me, and the seller simply registered the SIM card in his name. My tariff was 50 reais per month (less than $10) for 15 gigabytes of Internet + calls. Oi does not have any other prepaid tariffs, and from other operators you can get less internet for less money.
A good solution to this problem is, in fact, obtaining CPF. It is also issued to foreigners, and recently it can be obtained remotely. Instructions <a href="https://forum.awd.ru/viewtopic.php?f=444&amp;t=396789">HERE</a>.

<b>Security and more</b>
One of the key problems in Brazil is security. It is a country with a high crime rate, with many major cities ranking among the top for homicide rates, and tourists may also be victims of robbery, including armed robbery. You need to understand that the absolute probability of serious trouble is quite small, but in comparison with other countries it is much higher. This means that you don’t need to be afraid and shake like a leaf, but you shouldn’t neglect healthy safety measures either.
In Brazil, the larger the city, the more dangerous it is on average. This is an important difference from Russia, where Moscow and other big cities are completely safe, and you can only meet gopniks in small single-industry towns and villages. Here, on the contrary, small towns are much safer. Everyone who does not have a job and has a desire to engage in robbery goes to big cities, where there are, firstly, many potential victims, secondly, cheap housing in the form of favelas, and thirdly, illegal work in the shady business. Which specific cities are the most dangerous changes over time. Let's say in 2013 Maceio was in first place, and now it's Natal. Rio de Janeiro is not at the very top in terms of numbers, but it is the only city where there are many foreigners who are easily spotted.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946306274_a102ea0bad_h.jpg"/>

It is advisable not to appear on the street after dark, especially in office and shopping areas. Although in Sao Paulo and Rio I constantly broke this rule, I only walked in familiar crowded places - near Rio beach, in the center of Sao Paulo. Wherever it’s deserted, it’s better not to just walk around. Sunday is a weekly disaster in Brazil. Everything is closed, the streets are empty, it’s very uncomfortable to walk, especially in the city center. Try to plan your route so that on Sunday you will be in a small town or on the beach; if you find yourself in a big city, do not expect to see it on Sunday, it is better to add one more day of your stay.
Traveling by taxi is useful, especially to/from bus stations, which are usually in bad areas. In principle, I was not paranoid about public transport, but with the exception of the metro, I did not use it often, since taxis are cheap.
Before the trip, I bought a new phone, specifically choosing a model with a fairly good camera, and in those places where it was uncomfortable, I took pictures with the phone so as not to attract attention. In tourist, crowded places, outside cities, I filmed, as usual, with a DSLR.

<i>The most dangerous area of ​​Sao Paulo, where you shouldn’t go even during the day</i>

Healthcare in Brazil is provided by the state for everyone, including foreigners who can receive basic treatment, so you don’t have to be afraid of going broke if you break your leg.
I was vaccinated against yellow fever in Brazil. This is a disease that is present in the Amazon and Africa, in Africa many countries require a vaccination certificate for entry. In South America, some also require it, for example, to enter Panama from Brazil you need it. In Moscow, this vaccination can be done only in one place, but in Brazil anywhere and even free of charge. I was given a vaccination card, with which I later received a certificate in English at the Recife airport. At the Sao Paulo airport these certificates are no longer issued; there are advertisements advising you to obtain them yourself through a local “government services” website, or in some hospitals in the city.
There are much more measures regarding coronavirus in Brazil than in Russia. The main thing is that it is mandatory to wear masks even on the street, although in fact this is still not Europe, they will not rat you out, and they will not fine you outside the premises either. The police themselves are often among the most maskless. Other measures are also being introduced that differ from state to state and even from city to city. The most common measures are the closure of shops and restaurants no later than hour X (okay if it’s 9 pm, but sometimes it’s 5), a curfew somewhere around 11 or midnight (which no one observes anyway; in Sao Paulo it was at 8 all April, and even some restaurants were open). In a severe case, there is a type of lockdown, as I found myself in at the end of March - beginning of April at the peak of the second wave, when restaurants are open only for takeaway, non-food stores are out of stock, and the beaches are closed. Also, concerts, theaters and other public events are closed in Brazil. Some attractions are operating with limits on the number of visitors.
Sockets in Brazil are of the European type, but almost all of them are narrow, so if you have a round-shaped plug (like most large devices such as laptops), you will have to buy an adapter for 5 reals. As I understand, such sockets began to be installed relatively recently (in 2013 I didn’t have any connection problems in a year), so adapters are quite easy to find on sale.

<b>What to see</b>
Brazil has 26 states + capital (federal district). Of these, I was in 19.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946306394_56ddb9fa25_c.jpg"/>

Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Parana - three southern states where I was in 2013. Here are the Iguazu Falls and many resorts, including Florianópolis.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945968501_4684488e04_h.jpg"/>

Sao Paulo is the largest city in the southern hemisphere. There are few attractions here, but a lot of entertainment and good restaurants. You can also go to the coast to Santos or more distant resorts like Ubatuba.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945068632_e00eb1d400_h.jpg"/>

Rio de Janeiro is the crystal dream of my childhood. The most picturesque metropolis in the world.

In the same state is the magical city of Paraty.

Minas Gerais - ancient cities where I visited in 2013.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945968461_132f2cfc9b_h.jpg"/>

Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul - as the name suggests, a large forest inland. Here is the Pantanal, a region with a lot of wildlife.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946306434_1bdfb38e6d_h.jpg"/>

Brasilia and the state of Goias - canyons, waterfalls, cool weather, a capital built from scratch according to plan.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946427480_3c9f23e0a3_h.jpg"/>

Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas, Pernambuco, Paraiba, Rio Grande do Norte - geographically closest to Europe, old cities (Salvador, Olinda, Sao Cristovao), and many beaches on the ocean.

Of the remaining 8 states, four are a group in the northeast (Ceara, Piaui, Maranhão, Tocantins), the last large piece of Brazil, where I did not have the time and energy to go this time. There is the historic city of Sao Luis and the Lencois Maranhenses National Park.
There are four more small states in the north along the edges of the Amazon (Amapa, Roraima, Rondonia and Acre). I will definitely visit the first two if I ever go to Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana.


<b>Total</b>
The costs for two were approximately as follows:

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946230913_1de09b642e_c.jpg"/>
It is clear that the large number of flights across the country played a role here. And so you can easily travel around Brazil with a budget of $30-40 per day.
Overall, the trip turned out great, after a long forced break it was great to go on a long trip again, I saw a lot of new and interesting things, and didn’t have any serious problems.
