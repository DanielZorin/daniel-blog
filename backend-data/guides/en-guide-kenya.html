Kenya is one of the richest and most popular touristy countries in Africa.

<b>Visa</b>
At the beginning of 2024, the President of Kenya loudly announced that he was abolishing visas to Kenya for citizens of all countries of the world. What happened in fact: previously, most (including citizens of European countries) had to obtain an electronic visa for $50, but citizens of several dozen countries (mainly from Africa, Asia, Latin America - who had a reciprocal visa-free regime) could enter without a visa. Now everyone needs to obtain an electronic visa (except for six countries neighboring Kenya), although the price has dropped to $30. You CANNOT get a visa upon arrival/at the border, unlike Tanzania or Uganda. Now you need to provide documents for the electronic visa - airline tickets and a hotel reservation, that is, applying for it takes not two minutes, as in Ethiopia, but a little longer.
I entered on an East Africa Tourist visa (which I described in the review of Rwanda and Uganda), so I did not apply for an electronic visa.

<b>Base</b>
The sockets are British type.
$1 = 130 Kenyan shillings. I did not use ATMs, I only changed cash.
There are notes of 1000, 500, 200, 100, 50 shillings, and coins of 5, 10, 20 and 40 (in honor of 40 years of independence).

M-Pesa is a popular money transfer system in Kenya. These are transfers without a bank account, using a phone number. It operates on the basis of the Safaricom operator, since I had a SIM card from another operator, I could not register for M-Pesa.

<b>Transport</b>
There are trains in Kenya: the line connects Nairobi and Mombasa (two main cities). The railway was built recently, and it was clearly done by the Chinese - even the design of train tickets and the UI of the program in which cashiers issue tickets are exactly like in China. A ticket from Nairobi to Mombasa costs 1,500 shillings ($12) for a 5-6 hour journey (the speed is not Chinese, on average 150 km/h, but it's not bad either). You can buy a ticket online, but payment is only through the M-Pesa system. There are a couple of intermediary sites that sell these tickets with payment by regular cards, but there is a double markup. In the end, I asked the hotel manager to help me pay. You can also buy a ticket at the box office (again, they donâ€™t take cash, but you can pay by card), but the problem is that the train stations are very far from the cities, even further than the airports, you will spend more on a taxi there and back than the tickets cost. Right before departure, there may not be any tickets, at least from Nairobi the train looked full or almost full. From Mombasa there were many empty seats.

The main transport is still minibuses. There are not many big buses in Kenya, it seems - I have never been on them and have seen few and only briefly, there are obviously more of them in neighboring Tanzania. In Kenya, minibuses are more popular, called "shuttles" here. There are more "elite" shuttles, in which everyone sits in their own place, and are not packed like sardines, for example, the Mololine company. It is better to choose such minibuses if possible.

In cities, transport is also represented by minibuses, called "matatu". These minibuses are usually pretty run-down, super cramped with a very low roof. In Mombasa, out of interest, I mastered the matatu, rode three times on them to get to the beach and back. A ride on a matatu costs 50 shillings ($0.4).

Taxi is represented by familiar international apps Uber and Bolt. I mainly used Bolt. You can order a motorcycle taxi and a tuk-tuk (where it is available, for example in Mombasa) through it. I noticed that the prices for a tuk-tuk and a motorcycle are almost the same, and for a car it is one and a half to two times higher. A short trip around the city by car costs 200 shillings ($1.5).

<b>Accommodation</b>
Hotels in Kenya are cheap and of good quality. In Nairobi, I generally checked into the first hotel I came across for 1,000 shillings ($8), and even for this money the room was quite decent.

But the usual price is more like 1500 ($12). In Mombasa, I splurged and stayed for $25 so that I could have both air conditioning and a refrigerator.

Many hotels also offer breakfast. A typical breakfast in East Africa looks like this:

<b>Food</b>
The main Kenyan dish is called Nyama Choma. It is a large fatty piece of meat, grilled and chopped into pieces. There are special restaurants that specialize in this, where you can see how these pieces are fried.

The price is very reasonable - about 500 shillings for a half-kilogram piece ($4). As a sided dish, you can take "ugali" (pictured left) - rice porridge, similar to "pap" in South Africa.

In addition to choma, the dishes are mainly different types of meat and curry with rice/ugali/flatbread. The influence of Indian cuisine is noticeable; in Kenya, there are quite a lot of people from India, so the same chapati flatbreads are everywhere here.

Menu of a non-tourist restaurant. Dishes up to $3-5.

You can also eat at KFC for 5 dollars.

In Kenya, there are full-fledged modern chain supermarkets with a wide range of products. This supermarket (and it is not even the capital) even had European cheeses like brie. Meat and fruit in supermarkets are cheap.

<b>Internet</b>
As usual, I bought a SIM card from a private seller at the border. The Internet here is a little more expensive than in neighboring countries - I bought 3 GB for a week for 300 shillings.

<b>What to see</b>
The main reason tourists come to Kenya is for a safari. 99.9% buy ready-made tours, in which all the logistics both inside and between the parks are planned by the tour operator. The complete opposite of South Africa, where many people travel independently. Formally, it is not prohibited to travel on your own in Kenya (except for the most famous Masai Mara reserve, where it was banned in 2024), but few people do it. The most unpleasant thing is that since almost everyone is already with a tour operator, you won't be able to do what I did in Eswatini - come to the park and join a group safari. I expected that at least on Lake Nakuru this would be possible, because there were even some rates on their official website, but all this is irrelevant. In fact, I essentially had to rent a car with a guide for myself, and it cost a lot (15,000 shillings = $ 120). And this is in THE most accessible park, which is essentially located within the city limits. You still have to get to the other parks somehow, which is not trivial. In principle, you can probably drive yourself in Nakuru, I saw a couple of cars on safari, and the roads there are generally no worse than I drove in South Africa.

Entrance to parks in Kenya is also quite expensive - $60 to Lake Nakuru, and this is still a cheap park. Entrance to Nairobi National Park, which is right next to the capital, costs $100, same price for Masai Mara.
There are many animals in Kenya. I finally saw a huge herd of buffalo and a group of lions up close.

When I was driving to the border with Tanzania, the road went through Tsavo West National Park, where I saw elephants, giraffes and zebras even from the minibus.

Nairobi is the capital. When I was there, there were rallies, and everyone strongly advised me not to go to the city center (a month before, there were real fights with the police at rallies against tax reform, with casualties). So I saw Nairobi mostly from the car window. The city looks quite developed, there are many modern buildings, shopping centers, etc.

Mombasa is the second city, the main port and resort. There is a historical center and a Portuguese fort.

There are also beaches here. They would look nice, if it weren't for the seaweed and the powerful low tide, which makes it a long way to the water. It's also hard to get to the beach - almost the entire coastline is occupied by hotels, there are only a few public passages to the beach. The beaches should be better further from the city.

Kisumu is the third largest city, near Lake Victoria (the coastline, as usual, is built up with warehouses).

<b>Expenses</b>

The downside of Kenya is that you can be cheated or overcharged - a problem that I have rarely encountered in other African countries. In Kenya, in some places it's really brazen - right at the border, in a minibus (!) they asked me for 2000 shillings to Kisumu, with the real price being around 700 - I ended up bargaining for 1000. At the same time, right before that in Uganda, the driver calmly gave me change of 5000 from a 20000 note, even though he didn't have to, I didn't know the exact price. Otherwise, the country is pleasant and quite inexpensive.
