The vast majority of tourists come to Cambodia solely to visit Angkor. There are also a number of expat freelancers and downshifters who live here, attracted by the cheapness and ease of obtaining a visa, especially in light of recent changes in Thailand. I wanted to get to know this country with an unusual history better, but due to various circumstances I had to split it into two visits.

<b>Visa</b>
A visa to Cambodia can be obtained in three ways: at any border, at any embassy or via the Internet. A visa online costs $40, at the border and at the embassy it's $30. When I arrived from Vietnam, the driver collected 35, and the neighbors on the bus gave it (apparently they were not aware). At the border in Koh Kong they initially demand $37. If you argue, you can insist on $30. There may also be a fake “quarantine” station at the land borders, where they take your temperature and ask you to pay a couple more dollars. It can be ignored. I got my visa online to save space in my passport.
When leaving for Laos, they ask for a $2 bribe, but bargaining with the Cambodians is easy - you resolutely refuse several times, and they don’t really insist.
Cambodia probably has the most liberal immigration laws. The government understands that downshifters and freelancers bring some kind of money from outside, so living in Cambodia is as easy as shelling pears: when you enter, you get a business visa for $35 instead of a tourist visa, then you take your passport to any travel agency, pay about $300, and the visa is extended for a whole year, and it becomes multiple entry, that is, it does not expire when leaving for another country. Either once a year, or once every two years, you need to leave and come back again to get a new visa.

<b>Money</b>
Cambodia has an interesting currency system. Under the Khmer Rouge, money was completely abolished, so when the era of communism ended before it had even begun, the question arose of how to reintroduce it. Due to the presence of foreign peacekeepers, large amounts of cash dollars have flowed into Cambodia and are now in circulation everywhere. At the same time, there is also a Cambodian currency - the riel. In shops and restaurants, prices may be quoted in either dollars or riel. As a rule, prices in supermarkets and tourist restaurants are in dollars. In a hotel the price is quoted in dollars, in the market - in dollars only if it is round. You can pay in any currency. And here is the subtlety. The riel is sort of tied to the dollar, so the rate floats around 4,000 per dollar. In August it was 4095-4096 riel per dollar in exchange offices, in December - 4040-4045. However, in practice, dollars are converted to riel as 1 to 4000. This means that paying in riel is 1-2% cheaper. It is not surprising that taxi drivers and merchants will happily accept dollars from tourists. It is better for tourists to exchange their dollars for riel. This can immediately get rid of the problem of change, because change for 50 and 100 USD bills may not be available, or it may be given in counterfeit bills. Only in supermarkets with a cash register the rate is not rounded to 4000: there the exchange rate is automatically set to 4100, i.e. it doesn't matter what you pay with. In the Lucky supermarket in Phnom Penh the exchange rate is as much as 4200, it’s cheaper to pay in dollars there, but at the same time you can exchange $100 bills.
About 80% of my expenses were in riel. The only major dollar expense is the ticket to Angkor. It’s easy to feel like a rich man with riel: exchange offices give out riel in 10,000 and 5,000 bills, rolled into mini-packs of 10 and 20 bills, respectively. In theory, there are bills of 20, 50 and 100 thousand, but I have never seen them.
You can withdraw dollars from ATMs, in particular, from ABA Bank you can withdraw even a thousand dollars at once. In all ATMs the commission starts from $5, in ABA it seems to be proportional to the withdrawal amount and is equal to slightly less than 1%.

<b>Language</b>
In the cities I visited, everyone spoke at least some English. In the worst case, you can explain yourself using a calculator, if suddenly someone does not know the numbers in English. Signs that are not duplicated in English can only be seen in roadside cafes along the highway.
Communicating in Khmer is problematic because the language has almost no manuals and uses its own script with a large number of letters. But recently it appeared in Google Translate.

<b>Accomodation</b>
The quality of hotels is very good. The hotels are quite new, the rooms are spacious. In Cambodia there is a very big difference in the price of rooms with and without air conditioning: almost double. Without air conditioning, it’s easy to find a room for $5 or even cheaper, and it can even be a room with air conditioning, for which they simply won’t give you a remote control. With air conditioning it's $10. In Phnom Penh you have to look, in the main tourist areas near the embankment they ask for 15-20 dollars.

I was in Sihanoukville during the holiday season, and contrary to some opinions, there were no problems with housing for $10, the Chinese Zhongguo Guesthouse did not change the prices, and the conditions there were very good. Though, it’s not near the sea, but the market is nearby.
There are a lot of mosquitoes in Cambodia, especially in Sihanoukville, they swoop in at every opportunity, and they can bite you on the street too. I wonder why there are almost no mosquitoes in neighboring Thailand, but as soon as you cross the border there are a lot of them?

<b>Transport</b>
Airplanes in Cambodia are not very good - few low-cost airlines fly here, cheap tickets are only from Malaysia.
Buses run between cities. There is no system. There are really no bus stations, although there is some field outside the city where buses hang out, but tickets are sold there only before departure. You can really figure it out only in Phnom Penh, from where buses go to anywhere in the country. There is also the only organized company, Capitol Tours, with clear routes and prices.
In other cities, tickets are sold to tourists at travel agencies. It is impossible to get a ticket in any other way, because the offices of bus companies are all in different places and on the outskirts of the city, and are usually not marked on maps. It’s surprising that they somehow know how to organize transfers: when traveling from Siem Reap to Banlung there were two transfers, not even to buses, but to minibuses, at the other end of the country. On the other hand, I rode with a big detour all day from 8 am to 10 pm, although there is a much more direct, recently built road that takes 6-7 hours, and there are minibuses along it, which I saw in Banlung.
Prices:
Phnom Penh-Kampot - 18,000 ($4.5)
Kampot Kep - 8000
Kep-Sihanoukville - 24000
Sihanoukville-Phnom Penh - 20000
Phnom Penh-Battambang - 22000
Battambang-Poipet - 16000
Koh Kong-Sihanoukville - 32000
Phnom Penh-Siem Reap - 18000
Siem Reap-Banlung - 64000 (with transfers in Kampong Cham and Kratie)
Banlung-Stung Treng - 24000
Stung Treng - Don Det (Laos) - $12

Traveling by bus in Cambodia is much more comfortable than in the Philippines, if only because the roads are much better, however, the speed is quite low. This is because buses often make pointless stops, as if someone could not get by on a two-hour ride without going to the toilet or having lunch. I suspect that the restaurants where the buses stop are owned by the same bus companies. If you travel by minibus, it can take a long time to collect passengers and goods around the city before leaving. As usual, if there are only foreigners on the bus, then you are doing something wrong, namely, you are traveling in a rickety, cramped minibus. If you travel with Cambodians, the seats are softer and in general it’s tolerable to travel even over long distances.
The quality of roads has improved dramatically in recent years. 20 years ago there were no roads at all, all transport was along rivers. 10 years ago there was an asphalt road only from the Thai border to the Vietnamese border. Now I have covered almost all the main routes: Koh Kong-Sihanoukville, Sihanoukville-Phnom Penh, Kep-Phnom Penh, Phnom Penh-Battambang-Poipet, Phnom Penh-Siem Reap, Phnom Penh-Kratie-Stung Traeng-Banlung. There are only a few bad sections (asphalt with a lot of holes, shaking): about 50 kilometers on the Phnom Penh-Siem Reap highway (that’s where I didn’t expect), half of the highway from Kratie to Stung Traeng, and a section of 20 kilometers on the road to the border with Laos.
As for urban transport, there is virtually none. City buses have recently appeared in Phnom Penh; if you go to the airport, this is relevant, but I’ve never taken one. You can get around the city on foot or by taxi. Relevant in Sihanoukville, where I lived in the city center, from where the beach is two and a half kilometers away. The most convenient motorcycle taxi costs 1 dollar, you can ride together. Tuk-tuks in Sihanoukville charge prices several times higher.
You can also rent a bicycle (in Kep - $2.5 per day, in Battambang I saw it for $1) or a motorcycle ($8-10 per day).

<b>Food</b>
Most food in supermarkets is imported from Thailand or Vietnam, so prices are slightly higher. There are few supermarkets, only in the largest cities, and are largely aimed at foreigners (for example, they sell imported American, Japanese and Korean goods). The selection in mini stores is not very rich.
In Cambodia, prices for local and European food are often almost the same. I heard that somewhere you can eat for almost half a dollar, but I have never seen this. For this price, you can find noodles with vegetables from a street cart, but such food is only suitable for vegetarians. The standard price for a dish from the “noodles/rice with meat” series will be 5-10 thousand riel ($1.25-2.5). A dish in a tourist restaurant will cost about the same. Well, a little more expensive, three dollars. For example, in the good and cheap Capitol restaurant in Phnom Penh, the menu includes noodles (similar to Chinese), Vietnamese soup, and fried pieces of meat with fries (just like in Europe). In this restaurant, the two of us usually ate for 9-10 dollars, taking a five-course meal. One such lunch a day is enough. In the city of Kampot, the most expensive local restaurant, Rusty Keyhole, serves signature ribs (they claim to be the best in Cambodia), half a kilo of meat costs $8, the two of us could barely finish it. Sihanoukville has a whole scattering of interesting establishments with dishes for $2-3.
Things are different in Kep, where European restaurants are a bit expensive, and locals are nowhere to be seen. All the Cambodians who hang out there do this: they buy fresh shrimp or crabs from the market, cook them there, and have a picnic on the seashore. We did the same. A kilogram of crabs costs ~5 dollars, shrimps are the same. Crabs are a pain to clean, but they are delicious. There at the market you can get rice for a snack for 1000 riel, cane juice for 2000 (so you can sit at a table there), or a huge grilled fish for two dollars.
The most local food looks like this: there are several aluminum basins on a cart, and something is laid out there. Rice included. The normal price for this is 5,000 riel, but in the canteens where intercity buses stop, it can be 10,000. This food does not always look appetizing, but if you look for it, you can find something normal. Portions are not too big and not too small, just enough for one person. Since Cambodia is not rich, these dishes usually contain organ meats instead of real meat.
Fruits on the market cost something like this:
Durian - from 6,000 per kilo in season, in the off-season about 15,000.
Mangosteen - from 4000, but more often 7000-8000, only in season
Dragonfruit - from 4000
Salacca - from 7000
Guava - from 5000
Java apple - 6000
Pomelo - from 2500, but more often 4000 per piece
Jackfruit - 12,000 per kilo peeled
As usual, apples are the most expensive fruit, starting at $3. Strawberries in a store in Phnom Penh cost $25 per kilo and are brought all the way from the USA, but you can buy salacca instead.
Beer is incredibly cheap in Cambodia; in many bars and restaurants, local draft beer costs only half a dollar a mug! In Sihanoukville, at the bars on Serendipity Beach during certain happy hours (usually around midnight) you can get four mugs for one (!) dollar. You don’t even have to spend a dollar, but get drunk for free if you stock up on flyers during the day, come up when they pour it from everyone’s throat, etc. In general, a paradise for alcoholics.

<b>Internet</b>
There is Wi-Fi in hotels, but it is often glitchy. In none of the six hotels where I stayed for the first time did it work without problems: sometimes it falls off, sometimes it’s barely catchable, sometimes it’s at good speed. At times I went into the hallway to reboot the router by unplugging it from the outlet. But the second time there was not a single problem in seven hotels.
3G is very cheap. I got a SIM card from the Smart operator, it costs 1 dollar and another 5 dollars costs 4 gigabytes of traffic (2 gigabytes = 3 dollars). A good feature is that 3G is available not only in cities, but also on highways, at least between main cities. There are no particular complaints about the quality of 3G, however, Skype still does not work.

<b>What to see</b>
First, of course, Angkor. It’s quite possible to see everything in one day if, firstly, you go to Angkor Wat the evening before (with a ticket for the next day), and secondly, you prepare and know where and when to send the tuktuk.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-cambodia-54311_original.jpg" title=""/>
Sihanoukville is a city of eternal fun, where you can get drunk for a dollar.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-cambodia-54752_original.jpg" title=""/>
Banlung is a city in the far northeast. It’s not so hot there, it’s cheap, but there is decent infrastucture. Awesome volcanic lake and generally beautiful surroundings.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-cambodia-54790_original.jpg" title=""/>
Kep - if you want a beach holiday without partying, like in Sihanoukville.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-cambodia-55210_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Results</b>
In the first 14 days, $419 was spent, exactly $30 per day for two.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-cambodia-47239_original.png" title=""/>
Then for 24 days - 726 dollars, also $30 per day.

<img alt="" src="images/guide-cambodia-53453_original.png" title=""/>

Most of the money, almost half, went to food. And there’s nothing else to spend on (in December a little more was spent on travel across the whole country and entrance tickets to Angkor), so you can become a gourmet. If you save money (live in a room without air conditioning, eat as cheaply as possible), you can survive in Cambodia for two people on $10-12 a day.

<img alt="" src="images/guide-cambodia-53563_original.png" title=""/>

Food expenses. There was plenty of choice in Sihanoukville, you could spend a lot.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-cambodia-53149_original.png" title=""/>

I liked Cambodia. Although this country is not as developed as Thailand and Malaysia, it is clear that it is rising from its knees, infrastructure is being built before our eyes. The housing is quite comfortable, the internet is decent and cheap: you can work. The food is cheap, there is a large selection, and it’s easy to find something tasty. The atmosphere is relaxed and casual. <img alt="" src="images/guide-cambodia-47762_original.jpg" title=""/>
