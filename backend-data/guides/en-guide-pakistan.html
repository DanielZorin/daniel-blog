Pakistan is a country in every sense located at the crossroads of South, Central and Western Asia. It is linked to India by centuries of common history - under the British, the Mughals and even in ancient times. To Central Asia - by the border with Afghanistan and related peoples inhabiting half the country. To the Middle East - of course, by Islam. Back in the early 2000s, tourists more or less traveled to Pakistan, but from the late 2000s until recently, the country was very closed and had a bad reputation due to terrorist attacks and political instability. And then a couple of years ago Pakistan opened up to everyone, and I finally went there.

<b>Visa</b>
The visa can be obtained online here: <a href="https://visa.nadra.gov.pk/e-visa/">https://visa.nadra.gov.pk/e-visa/</a>
There are two options: Tourist Visa and Visa in your Inbox. In the first case, you submit an application, it is processed within 10-15 days, and if successful, they send you a PDF with a visa. Judging by the reviews online, some were even refused, while others were asked to send additional documents (for example, hotel reservations). The second option is that you fill out a form, and within 24 hours you receive an Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA), with which you can fly to Pakistan and get a visa at the airport. In this case, no one will look at your profile in advance. I chose this option, I received the ETA within a minute after payment. At the airport I had to wait a little longer until the border guards approved my visa (at that moment I also received a PDF with the visa in the mail).
The visa application form is the same for both options, quite long - about the same as for a US visa. One of the fun questions was to indicate all the countries where you have been in the last three years, and also with dates (!). The USA is at least just asking for a list. Among the documents, you must attach a scan of your passport and a hotel reservation from booking (the first one you need to enter in the application form).
The visa costs $35 for Russian citizens. Validity is 30 days for visa obtained through ETA.

<b>Basics</b>
Pakistan has two official languages ​​- English and Urdu. Local residents mostly speak Urdu among themselves - unlike India, where residents of the north and south will communicate more in English than in Hindi. By the way, Urdu and Hindi are very similar languages, or even two standards of one language. Urdu is not the native language of the majority of Pakistani residents (except for 7% of the mostly younger generation in the largest cities), it was originally brought by the Muhajirs - Muslim refugees from India, where they spoke the same Hindi/Hindustani, but written in Arabic letters.
Not everyone has a minimal command of English, even taxi drivers.
Each region has its own local language. In the east, closer to India, these are Indo-Aryan languages: Punjabi, Saraiki, Sindi. In the west these are Iranian languages: Pashto, Balochi and others.
The sockets in Pakistan are the same as in continental Europe.
The currency is called the rupee, as in many neighboring countries. Exchange rate $1 = 300 PKR. I didn’t withdraw money from ATMs for security reasons (so that the bank wouldn’t block my card for a suspicious transaction), and you most likely won’t be able to pay with a card, since they aren't accepted almost anywhere, and everyone pays only in cash. I've only seen a card payment terminal at McDonald's.
Cash must be changed at exchangers - points for issuing/sending transfers, most often under the Western Union or MoneyGram brands. I couldn’t change money at banks. Exchangers may not want to change a small amount (less than $100).
Banknotes have denominations of 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000 rupees. There are small coins, but they are sooooo rarely used, although I did manage to get them as change once.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-pakistan-865198_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Security</b>
There are "unsafe" areas in Pakistan - these are mainly areas near the borders with Afghanistan and Iran. In these areas, security may be required (not in the sense that something really threatens you there, but simply that you will not be allowed to drive or walk without it). It is most often used by those traveling overland from Iran to India via Pakistan - then, near the border, travelers are given an armed escort, who first travels with them for one day to the nearest large city of Quetta, and then for the second day before leaving the Balochistan region. The escort is free of charge. After the Americans left Afghanistan, it became possible to travel to that country; there seems to be a similar escort for traveling to the border. I don’t know exactly what will happen if you fly to Quetta or come there by train from the “safe” part of Pakistan. But I can imagine that there will be something like what happened to me in the city of Sukkur, which is completely safe and very far from the borders. There, due to a lack of time and free places, I had to check into a relatively expensive hotel (about $50). They reported me to the police, and as a result, the next morning they started calling me from there. All calls were something like this:
- As-salamu alaikum!
- Wa-alaikum as-salaam
- [something in Urdu]
- Could you speak in English please?
- [something in Urdu]
- Sorry, I don't understand
- [hangs up]
After the fifth time I stopped responding. The police were already waiting for me at the exit from the hotel. First they asked about my plans, I said that I wanted to see the local attractions and then go to the city of Larkana (approximately 100 km). Such plans suited them well. After that I was put in a police car along with a guard armed with a machine gun and taken to see a local temple, then a fortress. Then we were taken to the bus station and put on a minibus to Larkana. In Larkana, local police officers immediately met me from the minibus, but they were less zealous and only took me to the hotel, which I chose at random from the Google map.
In fact, in the end I saved a little on a taxi, but of course being under such an escort was very stressful. It seems like I wasn’t forbidden to look or photograph anything, but it’s still scary to be so close to the police. I was relieved to continue my journey without security.
Except for this situation, I had no problems with the police. The documents are not particularly checked, only in the north on the way from Gilgit to Skardu they checked a couple of times at checkpoints. Back in 2016, there were 10+ checkpoints on the road and permits were needed to travel.

<b>Transport</b>
There are many flights to Pakistan from the UAE, Qatar and other Gulf countries as many Pakistanis go there to work. Most likely, you will have a transfer somewhere there, and at the same time you have a good choice of where to fly, since there are flights not only to the capital, but to every major city: Peshawar, Lahore, Faisalabad, Multan, Sialkot, Karachi.
Domestic flights are available, but are relatively expensive. But if you want to go to the northern regions, they are worth it, since otherwise you will have to travel by bus for 24 hours.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-pakistan-870034_original.jpg" title=""/>
I was able to try trains in Pakistan. Compared to neighboring India, trains are not as popular, and tickets can be purchased a day or two before departure (at least I managed to do this - I traveled by train along the main corridor connecting the north and south of the country). There is an official website for selling tickets: <a href="https://pakrail.gov.pk/">https://pakrail.gov.pk/</a>. But it does not open from abroad, only from Pakistani IPs, apparently. Already on the spot, having a local phone number, I managed to register there, but I did not try to buy a ticket online, since there is a mandatory ID number field, which is a bit long for a passport number. In the end, I bought tickets at the ticket office at the station. Ticket prices are here:

AC Business class is a six-seater coupe with closing doors.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-pakistan-867553_original.jpg" title=""/>
AC Standard class is an open sleeper, it looks like this:
<img alt="" src="images/guide-pakistan-867902_original.jpg" title=""/>
I haven't tried Standard class. Apparently it looks the same as AC Standard, only without air conditioning.

Timetables can be viewed on the official Pak Rail mobile app. It downloads and works from abroad, although it is epically inconvenient - first you need to find a list of trains that run from the desired station and look at their schedules individually. And advertisements pop up every 10 seconds on the entire screen.
Trains do not run that often, even on the main line Peshawar - Lahore - Karachi there are +-5 departures per day, so you need to look at the schedule.

Buses run much more often. The problem with them is that here, like in Central America, each company has its own bus station. The schedule of some bus companies, such as Faisal Movers, can be found on the website <a href="https://www.bookkaru.com/search">bookkaru.com</a>. So I traveled from Peshawar to Islamabad. This site didn’t show anything from Larkana, I asked the hotel what company I should go with, they told me the name, and I took a tuk-tuk there. I traveled a short distance from Sukkur to Larkana on a no-name minibus.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-pakistan-870919_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Urban transport</b>
In Lahore, a metro was recently opened, judging by the design, built by the Chinese. Tuckets/tokens costs only 20-40 rupees.
In Peshawar, I took the metrobus (bus on dedicated lines and overpasses), there are several lines. One trip costs 50 rupees.
There is also metrobus in Islamabad/Rawalpindi, Multan and Karachi (just not in the center), but I didn’t use it there.
As a rule, I moved around cities by taxi. There are several taxi apps operating in Pakistan:
Careem is the largest, already known to me from Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries. Works similar to Uber. There are three main classes of cars: Go Mini - an old car without air conditioning; Go is a regular car with air conditioning, Go Premium is a luxury car (I’ve used it a couple of times because they arrive faster during times of high demand, when there are no other cars at all). Prices for these classes correspond approximately to 1: 1.5: 2. In standard and economy, trips around the city did not cost more than 1,500 rupees ($5), even very long ones of 20-30 kilometers. Short trips usually cost 400-600 rupees (up to $2)
Yango is our old friend Yandex Taxi, absolutely the same application only under a different brand. The prices are the lowest of all the apps, but there are the fewest cities (I think only Lahore and Islamabad).
InDrive - in this application you set the price of the trip yourself (there is a default offer), and drivers send you their counter-offers, usually a little higher. In general, the price is about the same as Careem. The advantage of this application is that you can go outside the city, whereas in Careem it does not allow you to create an order with an end point outside the city, even if it is 1 km outside the city.
Bykea - motorcycle taxi, haven't tried this app.

In smaller cities like Sukkur, or in the northern territories, no applications work; there you have to catch a taxi on the street. I usually took tuk-tuks as they are easy to find, whereas taxis are few and far between and are often not visually marked in any way (except for a Taxi sign under the windshield). You have to bargain with tuk-tukers; they don’t have meters like in India. But in Pakistan, tuk-tukers are very honest, and they always gave me reasonable prices. A short trip usually costs 150 rupees, a long trip can be 400-500. When I went to the excavations of Mohenjo-Daro, I paid 2000 round trip (this is about 60 km of travel + waiting).
<img alt="" src="images/guide-pakistan-872014_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Accomodation</b>
A hotel with air conditioning usually costs 15-25 dollars (I usually paid 5000-7000 rupees). Without air conditioning it is cheaper, around 2500 rupees (less than $10).
Peshawar - I booked a hotel on booking.com for a visa and only changed the dates. But they didn’t let me live there; they said foreigners weren’t allowed here. It's funny that in Peshawar there are only less than 5 hotels on booking.com (there are many in other cities). As a result, I walked 10 minutes to the main street and checked into the first hotel for 7,000 rupees.
Islamabad - I also booked for a visa, but after looking, I saw that the hotel seemed to be ok (Hotel Red Line). It is located far from the center, but it's okay since you can’t walk in Islamabad at all and you need taxi anyway. It was closer to Taxila and the airport. Cost 6000 rupees per day.
Gilgit - took a room without air conditioning for 2500. It turned out that it was still a little hot there, even though it was in the mountains.
Skardu - it was ok here without air conditioning for 2500.
Lahore - good hotel for 7000 rupees:
<img alt="" src="images/guide-pakistan-865902_original.jpg" title=""/>
Sukkur - I was thinking of finding a hotel near the station since I was arriving late in the evening. It turned out there was nothing there. I took a tuk-tuk to a cluster of hotels in another part of the city; out of four, only one, the most expensive, had vacancies; I had to fork out as much as 13,000 rupees. In this city I was protected by the police (I described the story above).
Larkana - here the police also met me, but they were less zealous. They only took me to the hotel that I randomly chose from the Google map - Hotel Asia. Cost 5500 rupees.
Hyderabad - booked through booking.com for 5000 rupees.
Karachi - booked the Crown Inn hotel through booking.com, cost 6500. In general, there is a whole street of hotels in this Saddar area.

<b>Food</b>
Pakistani food is a cross between Middle Eastern and Indian. On the one hand, local dishes are mainly varieties of thick sauces, which in India are called curry. On the other hand, there is no problem buying meat, including beef (but not pork, of course). Kebabs are sold everywhere.
Typical Chicken Karahi dish:
<img alt="" src="images/guide-pakistan-869368_original.jpg" title=""/>
You are supposed to eat with bread instead of a fork/spoon; in the most budget establishments there are no utensils at all.
The prices are very low. You can have a very hearty meal for 2-3 dollars, such as lemon chicken.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-pakistan-869586_original.jpg" title=""/>
This juicy kebab cost $8 per kilogram (Namak Mandi, Peshawar).
<img alt="" src="images/guide-pakistan-868249_original.jpg" title=""/>
There are, however, relatively few restaurants (but still more than in India). But you can often order food directly to your room at a hotel at normal prices.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-pakistan-868484_original.jpg" title=""/>
Western fast foods are also present in Pakistan. A combo with a regular burger at McDonald's costs about $5 (Rs. 1,400-1,500). KFC is abnormally cheap - you can get 10 wings there for 600 rupees ($2).
<img alt="" src="images/guide-pakistan-866931_original.jpg" title=""/>
There are almost no grocery stores, I only once found a supermarket in a shopping center in Islamabad, there was still a small selection and quite expensive. Everything is bought in small shops and markets. I didn't buy much. Prices are approximately like this:
Bottle of water 0.5l - 50 rupees
Bottle of soda 0.5l - 80-100 rupees
Small bag of chips - 40-50 rupees
A kilogram of sweet mangoes - 200 rupees

<b>Internet</b>
There are several operators in Pakistan, I randomly chose Jazz, and I didn’t guess - it turned out that it actually doesn’t have coverage in Gilgit-Baltistan, as a result I was stuck with slow 2G for three days. It's better to take Telenor.
The Internet is very cheap - I paid 450 rupees ($1.5) for a SIM card with 3 GB of Internet for a week. When they ran out, I bought a 30 GB package for another 500 rupees.

<b>What to see</b>
Peshawar is a city on the way to Afghanistan, where Pashtuns (Afghans) live.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-pakistan-868826_original.jpg" title=""/>
Islamabad is the capital. The city was built from scratch in the 1960s like <a href="https://goo.gl/3EkWMT">Chandigarh</a> or <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/684705">Brasilia</a>. The most pleasant and least dusty city in Pakistan. There are several monuments and small mountains right nearby.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-pakistan-865375_original.jpg" title=""/>
Rawalpindi is the city on the outskirts of which Islamabad was founded.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-pakistan-868967_original.jpg" title=""/>
Taxila - ruins of an ancient city, listed as a World Heritage Site. I took a ride there in a tuk-tuk.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-pakistan-871233_original.jpg" title=""/>
Gilgit is a city in the very north of Pakistan. This region is disputed between India and Pakistan; they fought over it in 1947. As a result, Pakistan got Gilgit-Baltistan, and India got almost all of Kashmir and Ladakh. Pakistan only has a small strip of Kashmir along its border. Now the Northern Territories are quite safe, and foreign tourists most often go there, since they have the highest mountains.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-pakistan-864324_original.jpg" title=""/>
The famous Karakoram Highway, the road connecting Pakistan and China, passes through Gilgit.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-pakistan-864754_original.jpg" title=""/>
Skardu is the capital of the Gilgit-Baltistan region. From here they go on long treks to the mountains, in particular to Mount K2 (the second highest peak in the world), but this requires permits and a special visa for trekking (not a tourist one).
<img alt="" src="images/guide-pakistan-869787_original.jpg" title=""/>
Flights to Skardu and Gilgit deserve special mention. The weather was good, and the views were the most epic I've ever seen - where else can you fly at the level of mountain peaks right next to them? In Nepal they specially make excursion flights to the Himalayas, but here a regular passenger flight passes so close to the mountains.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-pakistan-870379_original.jpg" title=""/>
Lahore is the main historical city, the capital of the Mughal Empire. The mosque and fort are listed as World Heritage Sites. Located near the Indian border, near the city of <a href="https://goo.gl/7VQpBd">Amritsar</a>.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-pakistan-866354_original.jpg" title=""/>
I went again to the border closing ceremony, which I had previously seen from the Indian side:
<img alt="" src="images/guide-pakistan-866218_original.jpg" title=""/>
Multan is a large city in the south of Punjab.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-pakistan-867647_original.jpg" title=""/>
Sukkur is a major city in the state of Sindh. I remember my adventures with the police.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-pakistan-870420_original.jpg" title=""/>
Larkana - nearby are the ruins of the ancient city of Mohenjo-Daro (a World Heritage Site).
<img alt="" src="images/guide-pakistan-866812_original.jpg" title=""/>
Hyderabad is the namesake of <a href="https://goo.gl/jGFQr2">Indian city</a>. I saw a couple of epic fortresses and a market.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-pakistan-864950_original.jpg" title=""/>
Karachi is the largest city in Pakistan. As in <a href="https://goo.gl/uz6yvz">Mumbai</a> and <a href="https://goo.gl/7tgwJw">Calcutta</a>, there's a lot of colonial architecture, which is now overgrown and destroyed.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-pakistan-865651_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Conclusion</b>
The trip turned out to be the cheapest in a long time, on par with the trip to Iran. The cheapness was a little spoiled only by expensive domestic flights, but they were worth it.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-pakistan-864086_original.png" title=""/>
In general, I can say that Pakistan is a very interesting country with a lot of attractions, and it’s worth going there if you are mentally prepared for the local specific flavor, similar to India. Compared to India, it’s easier to get around, the food is better, no one is trying to cheat/inflate the price, and it’s somewhat cleaner (the further south you go towards Karachi, the more garbage and beggars there are on the streets).
