In December, I finally traveled to Saudi Arabia, a country I've been wanting to go to since its opening at the end of 2019. Previously, it was one of the most closed countries in the world, where essentially only pilgrims from Muslim countries visiting Mecca were allowed. At the same time, I also visited the small kingdom of Bahrain in the Persian Gulf.

<b>Visa</b>
A visa to Saudi Arabia is issued online - you fill out a simple form, and in 5 minutes you will receive a multiple-entry visa for a year. The visa is quite expensive - the visa itself costs about $110, and now it also comes with compulsory medical insurance, the total is a little more than $160, like a US visa. It seems that you can get a visa upon arrival at the airport too.
In Bahrain there is also a “visa on arrival”, it looks like this - you go to the usual passport control, and while they are stamping your passport, you pay 5 dinars (about $14) by credit card or cash. You can get a visa in advance, but it is twice as expensive, and you need documents - a return ticket and a hotel reservation.

<b>Money</b>
The currency of Saudi Arabia is called the riyal. It is pegged to the US dollar at the rate of 1 USD = 3.76 SAR. There are banknotes of 500, 200, 100, 50, 10, 5 riyals and coins of 2, 1, 0.5 riyals. As a rule, prices are rounded to the nearest riyal. At an ATM you can withdraw a large amount in riyals - up to 5000 for sure.
In Bahrain, the currency is called the dinar, its unusual rate is 1 dinar = 2.65 US dollars. This is confusing at first, since I am used to always dividing the price and not multiplying it.

In Saudi Arabia there are some terrible problems with card payments on the Internet. I could pay for the visa with only one of my four cards - Turkish (Georgian, German, American did not work). Judging by the reviews on the Internet, I’m not the only one who has a problem; for example, no cards from Canadian banks go through either. I also had troubles paying for SAPTCO buses, and only with one card. The ticket for the excursion to Al-Ula was purchased using a Payoneer card, but I was never able to buy a ticket to Diriyah.

<b>Accomodation</b>
There are no hostels in Saudi Arabia, and airbnb is also not particularly developed here yet. But there are quite a few regular hotels. Hotels are often called "apartments", although they do not always have a kitchen. I booked on booking.com, although there is also a local analogue https://www.rehlat.com.sa/, which has a few more options, but the search is inconvenient. All hotels did not require a credit card for confirmation, and many were cash only, or cash and local MADA cards. The price ranged from 80 to 150 riyals ($20-40), with the exception of the city of Al-Ula, where housing is abnormally expensive, and I had to pay 350.

<b>Transport</b>
Saudi Arabia has long distances, so it is convenient to travel by plane. There are relatively cheap FlyNas airlines, where a ticket costs $30-50 per segment. Most flights are either from Riyadh or Jeddah.
There are two railway lines: the regular Dammam - Riyadh - Hail, and the high-speed Mecca - Jeddah - Medina. I couldn't ride any of them. I wanted to go from Dammam to Riyadh by train, but there were no tickets (you need to buy more than a week in advance). And in the end I didn’t need to move to Medina, since I planned the route in a different way.
The main way of transportation for me was the SAPTCO bus. They operate on schedule, although some destinations are not served every day. Prices are approximately $5 per hour of travel. There were almost always many empty seats (except for full buses Bahrain - Dammam and Dammam - Riyadh), seats were not fixed. No outlets or Wi-Fi.
Renting a car in Saudi Arabia is problematic, since all rental offices have an absurd mileage limit of 150-200 kilometers per day. With such a restriction, it is de facto impossible to travel by car, only to drive around a specific city and its immediate surroundings. Rent costs about 40-50 dollars a day, gasoline is cheap.

Within the city, transport is bad. This is the first country on my memory where even in large cities there may be no public transport at all. In recent years it has been appearing, in Riyadh and Jeddah there are already about 10 stable bus routes, the Riyadh metro is also being prepared for the opening, and plans are being made in other cities (Mecca theoretically already has a metro, but it only works for two weeks per year during the Hajj, as it connects places of pilgrimage that are empty outside the Hajj). So in a few years, probably, transport will be more or less at least at the level of the USA, but for now you have to take a taxi. There are three taxi apps: Uber (global), Careem (also works in other Middle Eastern countries) and Kaiian (purely local). A short trip costs at least 8-10 riyals, long ones usually 30-40, and to Riyadh airport about 80. The waiting time can be very long, waiting 20-30 minutes is the norm here - until a car is found and until it arrives.
Bahrain has a civilized and convenient bus system, buses every 15-20 minutes even on weekends, travel costs 0.300 dinars in cash, you can also get a card, then the daily limit is only 0.700 dinars.

<b>Food</b>
The food is standard Arabic/Middle Eastern - falafel, kebab, ful, chicken with rice, etc. Eating in a cheap establishment costs 15-20 riyals. There are also a lot of establishments with Indian and Pakistani food, I would say that there are more of them than Arabic ones. Everything there is classic, they don’t even give you a fork - you have to eat with bread. Authentic and tasty, if you like that kind of cooking. At McDonald's, combos cost about 22-26 riyals.

Previously, all Saudi restaurants had two separate sections - for men (single or group) and for families. Now this is becoming a thing of the past - some restaurants remain in this format, while in others there is no separation. Let's say that in most fast foods there is no longer any separation.
It's relatively expensive in stores. For example, 15 eggs cost 13 riyals ($3.5) - 2x compared to Turkey. Pringles chips cost 4 dollars instead of the standard 2, the cheapest fruit - tangerines - cost under 2 dollars per kilo, the rest are even more expensive.

<b>Internet</b>
On the first day, I bought a RedBull Mobile SIM card at a mobile phone store for 80 riyals, with a pack of 50 gigabytes of Internet. Large operators have smaller packs for the same price.

<b>What to see</b>
<b>Bahrain</b> is a small country on an island. There are skyscrapers, old streets, fortresses, dolmens and desert in the southern half of the island.

<b>Dammam</b> - oil is extracted here. A huge city built on a grid.

<b>Riyadh</b> is the capital. It is trying to catch up to Dubai - there is a straight avenue along which skyscrapers appear, and many residential areas around. The older part of the city with the castle and museums is reminiscent of India. On the outskirts there are also the remains of old Riyadh (Al-Diriyah), where, as it turned out, you need to buy a ticket in advance, although there are about zero visitors there and there are clearly no problems with overcrowding.

<b>Jizan</b> is a large city in the south near the border with Yemen.

<b>Abha</b> is a city in the mountains with a cool climate. There are small historical towns and beautiful canyons around, so it might make sense to rent a car to travel around the area.

<b>Jeddah</b> is the second largest city in the country. The historic center, listed as a World Heritage Site, is currently being reconstructed, leaving almost all the streets deserted. Jeddah is also a base for those visiting the holy city of Mecca.

<b>Tabuk</b> is a city in the north, I went from there to Al-Ula. There is a castle and a museum of the Hijaz Railway.

<b>Al-Ula</b> is a beautiful city in a valley among steep cliffs, here you can travel around the surrounding area, you can also go on an excursion to the tombs of Hegra (a city of the same culture as Petra in Jordan).

<b>Medina</b> is the second holy Muslim city, which, unfortunately, I couldn’t really see because I was sick.

Across the country, it is clear that Saudis are working to boost their tourism appeal. The country opened at the end of 2019, then immediately closed due to Covid, now in many places they are hastily restoring/rebuilding attractions and building infrastructure. While all this is in progress, I think in five years it will be very interesting to come and see it again.

<b>Conclusion</b>
The trip wasn't particularly cheap. In two weeks I spent one and a half thousand dollars (plus the flight Antalya - Bahrain and Medina - Istanbul - Antalya cost about 300 dollars). I had to spend $150 more on hotels than I planned. A lot was spent on taxi, though it was 20+ trips. Everything else is not that much.
