“Hanoi, whose residents have tasted the delights of socialism for much longer than in the south, in this regard is simply implausible, it is a city of moral monsters. Not an insult, but a factual statement. If you are writing a dissertation on moral monsters, then this is the place for you, on a field expedition, you will collect rich material."
"The price is 20,000 dong. The price is listed on the door and inside the bus. On the bus they try to charge foreigners 50,000 dong, or more (aka close to the price of private vans from a hotel in Hoi An to the airport in Da Nang). Locals may support the scam by pretending they are also paying 50,000 Dong, insist on the fare and they will lower it to 30,000, insist and pay the official one. Expect no change if you don't have a 20,000 Dong note. So: have exact change, stay calm, be polite, firm/unbudging and point to the pricetable. They will budge! Though it may not be pretty. Up to you if the hassle is worth 10k."
“The Vietnamese are cunning, sneaky, liars. They are much more insidious than the Chinese. You can never determine his real attitude towards you from the face of a Vietnamese. When he does nasty things to you, deceiving you, he will smile sweetly and calmly talk to you as if he were his best friend.”
After reading similar reviews, of which there are a great many on the Internet, I was very wary of Vietnam. What did I see in reality? In reality, I was once again convinced that it is better to see once than to hear a hundred times. That's why we travel, isn't it?

So, the route by day:
Da Nang - 2 nights
Hue - 1 night
Bus Hue-Hanoi - 1 night
Cat Ba Island - 2 nights
Hanoi - 2 nights
Dalat - 3 nights
Phan Thiet - 1 night
Ho Chi Minh City - 2 nights

<b>Money</b>
The Vietnamese dong is famous for being the currency with the lowest exchange rate in the world: for one US dollar they give as much as 22,000 dong. Inflation is high - five years ago the rate was around 17,000. Banks give 6-7 percent on deposits in dong (and in dollars - less than 1%).
I got all my money from ATMs. There is a catch here - most ATMs dispense a maximum of 2 million dong, which is less than $100. If you search a little, you can withdraw three million. If you really look for Military Bank (MB), you can withdraw 5 million at once, but not at any ATM.

<b>Language</b>
I haven’t mastered the Vietnamese language at all, I only remembered the numbers, but this is not particularly critical, because there are no special problems with English. That is, even half of the grandmothers standing at the market can answer the question “how much does it cost” (in those cities through which tourist buses go, at least).
In Vietnamese, you can memorize the words from the menu, since they are simple and short: my=noodles, xao=fried, ga=chicken, luon=eel, chao=porridge, ech=frog, and so on.

<b>Accomodation</b>
Vietnam has very good hotels at very low prices. In terms of style and comfort, South Korea is still ahead, but prices in Vietnam are the main argument. It was so cheap that I didn’t even bother with a long search for a cheaper hotel, but checked into almost the first one. Double rooms cost from 7 to 10 dollars, in Ho Chi Minh City they are more expensive - I checked in for 12. Rooms for this price are with air conditioning (except for Dalat, but there is no need for air conditioning, you need a blanket), without it they are cheaper. Half the hotels even had a refrigerator!
Unlike the Philippines, there are a lot of hotels, although fewer than in China.

<b>Transport</b>
Public transport in Vietnam is bad. In fact, it is only available in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City; in other cities there are at most two or three routes to the suburbs. There are practically no buses visible on city streets. There are no minibuses like Philippine jeepneys either. Fortunately, cities in Vietnam are compact, so you can walk everywhere if you learn to cross the road. In Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, bus routes can be built using Google Maps.
Traffic in cities is represented mainly by motorcycles, which do not stop at traffic lights. In fact, crossing a street where motorcycles are driving is not that difficult or dangerous. They drive slowly and have high maneuverability; if you go slowly, they will pass you. It’s more dangerous in Hanoi, where there are more cars, which I always tried to let pass, because colliding with a car is much worse than colliding with a motorcycle, and it’s also more difficult for a motorist to get around. The worst is Ho Chi Minh City, in some places there is a continuous flow of motorcycles, so it’s better to go around the intersection to be safe.
There are taxis in cities, they are inexpensive, about 11-15 thousand dong per kilometer. But there’s not much places to go by taxi anyway. This is due to the fact that Vietnam has an unusual intercity transport system, which eliminates the need to visit train stations.
In general, every city has a bus station and many also have a railway station, but it is very difficult to understand where they are. I honestly tried to find out where the bus station was in Hue, from where Hoang Long buses seem to go to Hanoi and Haiphong, for which you can buy tickets on the Internet. But Google didn't help me with this. In general, if you try to travel around Vietnam, as you are used to in Europe or China, then you will face a fiasco and trash on the level of the Philippines. Therefore, you need to do it the other way. You go to a travel agency and ask to sell a ticket to the city of X. The travel agent calls somewhere, after which he writes out a piece of paper by hand with text like “Hue-Hanoi, tomorrow at 15-00, two people.” The next day you either need to go to this travel agency (and it is most likely next to your hotel), or a minibus will drive right to your hotel and take you where you need to go. It seems that you are about to be deceived, there should be a ticket, not a piece of paper, even without a name and seat number, but nevertheless, the system really works! It's like you're on a package tour, where a bus picks you up and takes you where you need to go. This system was made possible because Vietnam is narrow and long, so essentially all buses follow the same route from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City, stopping in all interesting cities along the way.
Regarding prices, I haven’t really studied how regular non-tourist buses work and what their prices are, but many facts say that traveling on a tourist bus, is only slightly more expensive, which in Vietnamese realities is equal to 1-2 dollars, which you can overpay for convenience (and if you need to buy a ticket in advance, then a trip to the bus station will cost the same 1-2 dollars). For example, the Hoang Long website offers to buy a ticket from Hue to Haiphong for 440,000 dong (the bus most likely makes a detour via Hanoi anyway). At a travel agency in Hue, a ticket to Hanoi cost only 220,000, a Hanoi-Haiphong ticket for the same Hoang Long cost another 70,000. At the same time, the comfort of the sleeping bus I was traveling on (it said Queen Cafe on it) was much higher than the sleeping bus Hoang Long, which has mega-uncomfortable beds with non-rising backs. For comparison, a train ticket from Hue to Hanoi will cost more than 300,000 VND in the lowest class with hard wooden benches in a stuffy environment without air conditioning. The price is closer to a million dong in the sleeping car.

In general, trains in Vietnam are quite useless, they run less frequently than buses, and are more expensive (except for the lowest class). However, I did ride from Da Nang to Hue once. It was cheaper than the bus (40 thousand versus 70), but there wasn’t much choice, because I didn’t find travel agencies in Da Nang, and the bus station was far away, while the station was in the city center. The train was an hour late. At least the carriage wasn't crowded, there were plenty of free seats. It is interesting that numerous online travel agencies sell train tickets with a markup of $10, so Da Nang-Hue costs from $12 with a real price of $2, but for long distances the difference remains the same $10.
There are also cheap domestic flights in Vietnam. Since I flew to Da Nang, which is located in the middle of Vietnam, I would at some point have to travel across the country for more than a day by bus. By plane from Hanoi to the south (to Dalat or Ho Chi Minh City) costs around 50-60 dollars. From Ho Chi Minh City to the south (Dalat, Nha Trang, Phu Quoc) an average of $20 per ticket. Baggage extra $6.
In Da Nang, for the first time, I walked from the airport to the hotel (in Biarritz and Eilat there is also an airport in the city center, but I did not fly there). In Hanoi, a minibus runs from the center for 40,000 dong, in Dalat from the airport it costs the same, but there were few people, instead of a bus, all passengers were seated in a taxi.

<b>Food</b>
Oh, it's just a feast. After China, I didn’t have such joy: in Korea it’s still a little expensive, you need to choose wisely, in the Philippines the food is not tasty, in Taiwan I overfed myself a little, but there you also need to be careful, in Hong Kong it’s expensive, but Vietnam is perfect. There is plenty of food, the food is delicious, and it’s cheap.
Basic dishes are good old noodles (my, pho) or rice (com). Pho (pho) is a Vietnamese specialty; the cheapest establishments can cook it for 25-30 thousand (less than $1.5). Vietnam really knows how to handle spices (shout out to the Filipinos, who don’t even add salt), so regular fried noodles (my xao) are very, very tasty. Noodles and rice cost between 25-35 thousand. There is also Vietnamese chao porridge, which also contains meat.
If you raise the budget to, funny to say, three dollars per dish, then an almost unlimited range of dishes becomes available to you: shrimp, mussels, fried frogs, crocodile meat. On the Vinsky forum, many write that in Vietnam you need a budget of 100 dollars a day, not counting the hotel. I thought for a long time how I could manage to spend so much, since it’s unlikely that anyone would physically be able to eat 30 servings of shrimp for $3. Apparently, we need to use the big shots: take a fried cobra for $40 and polish it with lobsters. And so every day.
<i>Two dollars, Carl!</i>

In Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, the food is somehow worse, there are not enough cheap establishments in the main area with hotels, and walking far there is physically unpleasant, there are too many motorcycles.
I wanted to try dogs in Hanoi, but couldn’t find where. I only saw raw meat on sale, and no restaurants were found in the center.
From the French, the Vietnamese adopted a love for baguettes. While in other Asian countries bread is only available in expensive expat shops, in Vietnam it is sold at every turn. A small baguette costs 3 thousand, a large one - 7 thousand, and for 10-20 thousand you can make a mini baguette with meat and vegetables, a kind of Vietnamese doner.
<i>Five-course lunch with drinks for $12</i>

Fruits are sold at the market. Approximately the following minimum prices have been determined empirically, although there is no guarantee that this is the absolute minimum:
Dragonfruit - 10 thousand per kilo
Avocado - 10 thousand per kilo
Peach - 35 thousand per kilo
Pomegranate - 30 thousand per kilo
Durian - 20 thousand per kilo
Strawberries - 50 thousand per kilo
Rambutan - 30 thousand per kilo
Grapes - 30 thousand per kilo
Plum - 30 thousand per kilo
Mangosteen - 40 thousand per kilo
Momodrika - 30 thousand per kilo
Carambola - 30 thousand per kilo

In any cafe you can buy fruit shakes and smoothies, from 15 thousand to 25 thousand, depending on the fruit. In general, cafe-class establishments in Vietnam, unlike Russia, are not characterized by unreasonably inflated prices; you can go to any one to drink coffee or a smoothie and escape the heat. Except that Starbucks in Ho Chi Minh City will be more expensive.

<b>Internet</b>
Mobile Internet is cheap and quite fast. There are several operators, their tariffs are approximately the same. I bought a Mobifone SIM card because I came across their office first. In general, there are not very many offices; SIM cards are mostly sold in stalls without any registration, although formally a passport is required. A Mobifone SIM card costs 50,000 dong, and a 600 megabyte monthly package costs 70,000. In total, I spent less than $6. At the same time, after the 600 megabytes ran out, my Internet did not turn off, but simply became slower (pictures load slowly, but otherwise it’s tolerable). I had no problems with coverage, even on the highway I could get 3G almost all the time, although I read that for traveling through the Vietnamese wilderness, the operator Viettel is better, as it has coverage everywhere.
Wi-fi is available in all hotels, the quality in some places is acceptable for surfing and work, in others it’s simply excellent. I did not experience any irritation or troubles related to the quality of connection in Vietnam.

<b>Entertainment</b>
Museums in Hoi An - 120,000 VND ($6)
Forbidden City in Hue - 150,000 ($7)
Ha Long Bay Day Tour from Cat Ba Island - $18
Crazy House in Dalat - 40000
I left the Mekong Delta and guerrilla tunnels near Saigon for another time.

<b>Safety and scams</b>
After reading negative reviews, I tried to behave carefully. For example, I exchanged large bills of 500 thousand, buying ice cream for 3 thousand at KFC, so that in any market I could always give money without change. But in the end, I still couldn’t find where they were so brazenly cheating and deceiving me in order to rip me off to the skin.
Menu for foreigners? I actually saw this once, the prices there were 30 percent higher, but there was also a regular menu in Vietnamese hanging on the wall, I pointed it there. No other public catering establishment charged me too much; they always gave me change. There is, of course, a nuisance that in many places there is no menu with prices, you can only ask for them, but somewhere they hang, so I know very well that pho soup costs 25-30 thousand dong. If it costs 50-60, then this is a more pretentious establishment, and I have not seen more expensive ones.
You can also bargain in the markets. For example, the price per kilogram of fruit can be reduced from 40 thousand to 30. The real price may even be 25 or 20, but this is still not 10 times too high. Although I doubt it: firstly, in stores with price tags or even in malls with prices written on cardboard, prices were the same or even higher; secondly, all sellers quoted the same price; if they blatantly deceived foreigners, then the price would be different for different people depending on the degree of greed.
There are no problems in hotels, I relaxed and didn’t even ask for receipts. Some, it turns out, for some reason pay at the hotel for all days at once upon check-out, although I, having visited hundreds of hotels around the world, have only encountered this a couple of times, but this was in Europe, where I left my credit card number anyway cards via booking.com. In my opinion, paying when leaving is the same as negotiating with a taxi driver about the price when leaving. By the way, the only time I took a taxi in Vietnam, the driver quite easily agreed to use the meter (I remember it was worse in Indonesia), and there’s really nowhere to take a taxi there.
It’s a strange claim about being annoying in general. Well, yes, when you walk down the street, they often offer a motorbike, but this is like white noise to me, I don’t pay attention, because I don’t need a motorbike. If you say “No”, they immediately move on silently. Those who think this is arrogance are invited to take a ride to <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/310031.html">Petra</a>, where such a person with a motorbike would follow you for at least 10 minutes.

<b>Results</b>
Over 15 days, expenses amounted to $656, about $43.5 per day. Of these, almost 40% is travel, so if you don’t try to travel across the entire country in two weeks, then in Vietnam it’s easy to fit into a budget of $30 a day for two persons, without denying yourself anything. It turns out that Vietnam is the cheapest country I've ever been to.

I came to Vietnam with caution, hoping that if something happened, I would bite the bullet, see all the sights in two weeks and leave. But already somewhere halfway through the journey it became clear that I wanted to return here. Comfortable, tasty, cheap, polite, what else do you need? We can’t return until after a month, and I figured it would be most convenient in October. Then I will be able to go on a tour of the Mekong Delta for a couple of days, see the second Vietnamese resort - Nha Trang, and spend a week in the best city in Vietnam - Dalat. So to be continued!
