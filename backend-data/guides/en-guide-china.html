Exactly a month ago I <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/363261.html">left Russia for China</a> to nomad. It's time to sum up the first results and draw conclusions about this new format for me.
First, about the tourist part. <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/363948.html">The plan for March</a> was generally completed, although the route changed somewhat and became like this:
<img alt="" src="images/guide-china2-18770_original.png" title=""/>

Now I'm in Xi'an, tomorrow I'm going to go further.
Day by day (more precisely, night) it turned out like this:
Heihe - 2 nights
Train Heihe-Harbin - 1 night
Harbin - 2 nights
Changchun - 1 night
Girin - 1 night
Shenyang - 2 nights
Dandong - 2 nights
Dalian - 2 nights
Tianjin - 2 nights
Beijing - 4 nights
Taishan - 3 nights
Qufu - 2 nights
Jinan - 1 night
Train Jinan-Hengshui-Pingyao - 1 night
Pingyao - 1 night
Train Pingyao-Xi'an - 1 night
Xi'an - 3 nights

Now the most interesting thing, about money. I estimated a budget of $30 a day for two, but as it turned out, such a budget is realistic if you save on everything. If you don't save, that's $40 a day. I'm not taking into account options like hitchhiking and couchsurfing here, because I'm not sure I could work with that type of travel.
$1 = 6.2 yuan. 1 yuan = 10 rubles. Here and below are graphs from the gnucash program, which I use for budgeting.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-china2-19064_original.png" title=""/>

Most of the money was spent on travel. We traveled mainly by trains. In China there are high-speed trains and regular trains. There are two classes of high-speed ones, of which only the second is of interest (the first is very expensive and makes no sense). Regular trains have seats, open sleepers and compartments. There are "hard seats" and "soft seats", but soft ones do not make sense, since they cost almost the same as a sleeper. A coupe is twice as expensive as an open sleeper, so I didn’t consider that either.
At prices for the same distance, it is usually cheaper to take a seated regular train, than a sleeper, and most expensive to take a high-speed train. If you have two weeks to travel around China, then there is a reason to take expresses so as not to waste time. I'm in no hurry, so I usually take the cheapest seat to travel during the day. For example, it was much cheaper to travel to Taishan during the day or evening, even for 7 hours, in a seated carriage than to take a sleeper, even taking into account the savings on the hotel. In addition, sleeper tickets are sold out faster. So, from Heihe to Harbin two days before departure there were no sleeper tickets, I had to travel overnight in a seated car, it was terrible, worse than taking a bus, but there wasn’t much choice.
Once we flew by plane, from Dalian to Tianjin; if you look at the map, it becomes clear why it is more convenient than by train. In terms of money, the plane was cheaper than a sleeper (206 yuan with all taxes).
Buses in China are much more expensive than trains, almost twice as expensive. Buses have only one advantage: you don’t have to buy tickets for them in advance.
Transportation around the city is ridiculously cheap, $30 for the entire month. With the help of baidu maps, you can understand the routes of city buses, which saves money (the bus is cheaper than the metro) and time.
I used taxis twice: to get to Dalian airport in the morning (I was never able to find out where the buses were coming from), and to get from Taishan Mountain to the hotel in the evening (I no longer had the strength to walk).

I spent $333 on hotels. The cheapest was in Harbin (40 yuan), the most expensive was in Shenyang (100).
<img alt="" src="images/guide-china2-19235_original.png" title=""/>
When I was in China last time, the price of 200 yuan per room seemed ridiculous to me: in Russia you can’t always find rooms for 1000 rubles. Now I have lowered the bar to 100. The general conclusion is this: for 80-100 yuan you can rent a <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/365781.html">chic</a> (by Russian or European standards) number, but you will have to spend some effort to find it. For 130-150 you can find it without bothering or haggling at all. The cheapest housing can be rented for 50-60 yuan, but the comfort there will not be very good.
In general, housing starts at a ridiculous 20 yuan per room, but renting for that price is almost impossible for a foreigner. The fact is that in 99% of cheap hotels they will immediately wave their hand at you: “We do not accommodate foreigners.” I tried to find out the reasons on the Internet. Apparently, 10 years ago, foreigners could really only live in reputable hotels of 4 stars or more. Then this restriction was lifted, now you can even couchsurf. In theory, the hotel must register the guest with the local migration service (if you are staying with a local, you need to go there yourself), and it seems that the administrators of cheap hotels simply do not want to deal with this. However, sometimes it is possible to check into a cheap hotel informally. According to my observations, in small cities such as Jilin or Tai'an, this is easier, although there are exceptions, for example, Dandong. The worst was in Beijing; we probably visited at least 30 hotels, and all without success.
Cheap hotels in China are comparable in level of comfort to cheap hotels in Russia or Latin America, more or less shabby rooms in the "Soviet" style. It’s interesting that even the cheapest and most miserable hotel has rubber slippers and Wi-Fi. Most also have a kettle, and for some reason many have a computer instead of a TV.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-china2-20093_original.jpg" title=""/>
During this month I never booked a hotel in advance. The search algorithm is something like this. You leave the station and walk around the streets, preferably not avenues, but side streets. Regular trains arrive at central stations, which are close to the city center (as opposed to high-speed train stations, which are often located on the outskirts), so the area around the station is logistically convenient. Reservation systems like booking and agoda rarely give really good deals. I mastered the baidu maps application on my phone, it can search for hotels around the current location and sort by price. If the price on baidu looks good, at the reception I simply show the page on my phone, asking if such rooms are available. If I enter a hotel from the street, I simply ask how much the room costs, I can haggle a little and knock down 10-20 yuan.
The only place where this algorithm did not work was Beijing. They don't offer accommodation in cheap hotels there as a matter of principle. However, fortunately on agoda.com there was a very favorable offer from one hotel, which was even within walking distance from the central square - 85 yuan per day. At the counter they asked me for 100, to which I reasonably noted that then I could just book from my phone for today for 85. After some misunderstanding, I rented a room for only 79, i.e. 85 minus site commission!

Food is very interesting. In China, you can eat for two on $12 a day, if you don’t deny yourself anything. If you are an adherent of proper nutrition and do not buy sweets and snacks, then you can keep it under 8 dollars.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-china2-19554_original.png" title=""/>
An approximate price breakdown is as follows. Any small street is lined with eateries. The price level is approximately the same. A meat dish costs 20-30 yuan. Noodles and soups cost 5-10 yuan: if there is no meat, it's 5 (some soups even 3), if there is meat, then 8-10. Vegetable dishes are usually also around 10. Chinese dumplings - about half a yuan each, served in portions of 8-10 pieces. The menu, of course, is only in Chinese. Baidu translate can translate well, often even uploading a photo of the dish. In some places there are photographs of dishes on the walls, as a rule, there are only photographs of more expensive dishes, cheap ones are only on the menu.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-china2-19758_original.jpg" title=""/>
I have never been to McDonald's, KFC or other establishments with cuisine that is exotic by local standards.
I can talk endlessly about Chinese food; someday I will write a megapost on this topic in several parts.
This time I divided the “other expenses” column into two, highlighting “entertainment” as a separate category; in fact, for now it's only entrance tickets to all sorts of attractions. As you know, attractions in China are expensive, so reasonable savings are needed here. You can get into most places for half price by calling yourself a student, while some only accept Chinese students, others accept a Russian student card or something similar.
Where we were:
Changchun Japanese Occupation Museum - free
Shenyang, Forbidden City - 60 yuan
Dandong, Great Wall of China - 60 yuan (good site, no people at all)
Beijing, Forbidden City - 20 yuan for student
Beijing Zoo - 5 yuan for students, another 5 for entry to the pandas.
Beijing Summer Palace - 20 yuan
Beijing, Temple of Heaven - 10 yuan for entering the park, another 20 for entering the temple itself
Beijing, park opposite the Forbidden City - 2 yuan
Beijing Art Museum - free
Mount Taishan - climbed for free through the forest. It turned out very cool, more fun than walking up the steps for five kilometers. In general, the entrance fee is 125 yuan, another 30 yuan one way for a bus to the middle of the mountain, and 100 yuan one way (!) for a cable car to the top. The entire path can be walked, it is about 7-8 kilometers along the steps.
Qufu, Confucius Temple - 90 yuan, Confucius Cemetery - 40 yuan.
Jinan, park with springs - 5 yuan, students 2.5.
Pingyao - one ticket for the whole city costs 150 yuan, we took one student ticket for 75, and took turns, since different houses are quite similar. The most impressive thing is the walk along the city wall. In principle, at unpopular exits you can step over the turnstile.
Xi'an, Terracotta Army - 150 yuan. Two tickets accounted for 40% of the month's entertainment costs. There are no discounts for foreign students, although I read that someone still managed to get a ticket at half the price.

Among other expenses, the most was spent on the Internet: I bought a 3G SIM card for $48 (300 yuan) from China Unicom. 3 gigabytes for six months (+ another 9 gigabytes in the province where the card was purchased, they remained in Harbin). I need stable internet for work, although so far in many cases I have been satisfied with hotel Wi-fi. I used up 600 megabytes in a month, and for the last 10 days I haven’t really tried to save traffic. The rest of the little things: napkins, soap, washing powder, brush, knife, glue, belt, shoes - in total they cost about 13 dollars.

All expenses for the month amounted to about $1200. During this time I earned more, so from a financial point of view at the moment I am in the black. In principle, you can squeeze 40 hours a week out of yourself at this pace, but so far there has been no serious need for this, I even sometimes spent time writing posts on LiveJournal. Though, training in new technologies is still going rather poorly, since priority is given to current work and scientific tasks, as well as to learning Chinese.

And finally, five juicy places in a month.
Harbin.
<img src="images/guide-china2-38371822961_2b821c23d4_o.jpg">
Here on the left is China, and on the right is North Korea, well, you know what I mean.
<img src="images/guide-china2-38341543032_f34788bbb2_o.jpg">
Tianjin is the coolest city, for some reason ignored.
<img src="images/guide-china2-24501409198_73886bec8b_o.jpg">
Mount Taishan, or rather, the mountains near it.
<img src="images/guide-china2-24501409378_b6e58f3f64_o.jpg">
Pingyao is the most colorful city in China so far. Most importantly, almost the entire old city is residential, not touristy.

</img></img></img></img></img>

My second month in China has ended. I can now speak Chinese orally, I understand half the menu in a restaurant, I know my way around Chinese cities perfectly, and the number of regions I have visited in China has exceeded half.
<img src="images/guide-china-38341510522_a107dc5553_o.png"/>
By the way, initially I thought that some regions, such as Guizhou and Fujian, would have to be skipped, but in the end the plans neatly worked out so that I would get to all regions except the western ones (the plan for May is marked in yellow). This is the system! Better than hitchhiking in three weeks from Urumqi to the Vietnamese border. I now know the typical dishes and sweets of different regions and can even distinguish the Beijing dialect from the Chongqing dialect by ear.
As a result, the April route looks like this:
<img src="images/guide-china-38341516372_1550c95530_o.png"/>
Work made some adjustments to my plans, so in Guilin and Yangshuo there were two days when I went out for a walk at 3-4 pm, and worked from the very morning.
Expenses for the month amounted to  $1233 (for two). That is, <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/369405.html">unlike March</a> we barely missed $40 a day.

<img src="images/guide-china-38341510932_e2826c24eb_o.png"/>
For convenience, I made a Cash flow statement in gnucash:
<img src="images/guide-china-38341510812_a26c28446d_o.png"/>
<b>Housing</b> was more expensive this month than last, by an average of $1 per day. Per night it went like this:
Luoyang - 2 nights
Train Luoyang-Yichang - 1 night
Yichang - 1 night
Zhangjiajie - 4 nights
Fenghuang - 1 night
Huaihua - 1 night
Chongqing - 5 nights
Train Chongqing-Guiyang - 1 night
Guiyang - 1 night
Guilin - 2 nights
Yangshuo - 2 nights
Guilin - 1 night
Nanning - 1 night
Zhanjiang - 1 night
Haikou - 3 nights
Sanya - 3 nights
<img src="images/guide-china-38341510352_ffc52da47f_o.png"/>
I feel like since I started speaking Chinese in hotels, checking in has become a little easier, however, there are still problems with a foreign passport. The biggest problems were in Luoyang (where, due to heavy rain, we ended up staying at the most expensive hotel for the month) and Chongqing, the largest city. In Chongqing, I tried to rent an apartment or a room in apartment buildings near the station, there are a lot of people walking around with “room for rent” signs. They even wanted to rent out one room to me, but there was no internet there. At first they seemed to agree, but then they changed their minds. In the end, I went to the address of the cheapest hostel from booking.com and lowered the price a little more. But the hostel had a washing machine, which allowed us to wash absolutely all our clothes at once and without much effort.
In tourist places there are no problems with check-in. Surprisingly, there were no problems in such unusual places as Huaihua, Nanning and Zhangjiang. On the island of Hainan you can live in the private sector, just like in Crimea and <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/342944.html">Dubrovnik</a> you can rent a room from a grandmother right at the bus station.
<img src="images/guide-china-38341510792_52561736bc_o.png"/>
Spending on <b>food</b> increased slightly this month, primarily on non-restaurant food. There is a logical explanation for this - in snowy Harbin at -15 there was simply nothing to buy or eat on the streets, but here in the south, pineapples, mangoes and other fruits are sold everywhere, and because of the heat, ice cream is consumed often. Every time you think that you have already tried all the street snacks and sweets, something else unimaginable begins to be sold in a new city. Sweet-glazed apples, ubiquitous in the north and center, have been replaced by pineapples and watermelon on a stick.
<img src="images/guide-china-26596257919_78aa043736_o.jpg"/>
I even thought about trying lobster. The smallest one here costs 100 yuan per piece, you can get a larger one for 130. The price by weight is 200 yuan ($35) per kilogram, but the problem is that a kilogram of lobster produces very little meat, it is essentially only in the tail. I decided to postpone this pampering for another time.
<img src="images/guide-china-38317006196_dae022bb84_o.jpg"/>
With <b>travel</b> I didn’t discover anything particularly new compared to last month. All the same trains and planes. Once we took a ferry ride to Hainan Island (42 yuan - $7). Once we were late for a train in Guilin, it turned out that in such a situation it was possible to change the ticket for the next train, paying only the difference in price. The negative difference, however, is not returned. The cashier said that you can change the ticket once.
Of all the cities in April, only Chongqing has a metro, but I traveled more by buses. City bus transport was also used in Luoyang, Yichang, Guilin, Haikou and Sanya. We only took a taxi once in Chongqing so as not to miss the train.

<b>Entertainment</b> this month is as follows:
Grottoes in Luoyang - 120 yuan. Not cheap, but worth it, there's a lot to see.
Wulingyuan National Park ("Avatar Mountains") - 248 yuan. Alena asked for a student card for 160. $40 is not cheap, but with this ticket you can go to the park for three days in a row, so it’s not that expensive for a day, and there is something to see there for all three days, even if the weather is good. Apart from entrance tickets, we didn’t pay for anything else in the park; all the cable cars and funiculars (and one-way travel on them, including the descent, costs about $15) can easily be reached by stairs for 30-60 minutes. After Mount Taishan it is just an easy walk.
Fenghuang - just for entering the streets of the old city they want as much as 150 yuan, but there are no ticket checkers on some side streets in the far part of the city. I easily found two entrances, one in the east and one in the west, through which I could, if necessary, bypass the ticket office.
Chongqing Southern Hot Springs - 44 yuan for entry. There are pools with warm mineral water, like in <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/365885.html">Tyumen</a>. There are many other springs in the city, but they are either much further from the center or much more expensive.
Guilin and Yangshuo. There are a lot of tourists in this area, including foreign ones, which is why people here like to charge money for every sneeze. You need to be careful not to go broke. So, in Guilin they want 70 yuan to look at one rock in the city center! On the opposite side of the river, more trees were specially planted so that it would be impossible to take photographs, and the area was fenced off with two rows of barbed wire. However, the rock can still be seen through the trees or from the river bank a little further away. In another park (Chuanshan) they wanted as much as 80 yuan for entry, although the Chinese seemed to get in for free. As it turned out later, on the other side of the park there is not even a ticket office, there is just a village with fields, very colorful by the way. We climbed the hill along the path from the back side, but there was no through passage into the park. When we got down, it was already 5 o’clock, and the ticket office had simply closed, so we could go into the park just like that.
In Yangshuo, the main tourist street is West Street, there are a lot of restaurants with menus in English, the atmosphere is sad, everything is expensive and not authentic. But closer to the bus station you can find accommodation and food at reasonable prices. There you can rent a bicycle for 20 yuan per day (in the center they will charge 50-70) and ride around the surrounding villages. Paid places were in Moon Hill (15 yuan, a very simple climb to the rock), where we got by bicycle, and on the hill with the TV tower in the city center (10 yuan, it seems, not quite officially).

In Xi'an we left our winter clothes, and as luck would have it, we were immediately struck by cold for 10 days. In the southern part of China there is no central heating, and due to the high humidity, +10 feels like frost. In Zhangjiajie I had to sleep under two blankets without getting out. Warm weather arrived only in Chongqing.
From <b>other expenses</b>:
Swimming trunks - 25 yuan at Walmart in Chongqing
Umbrella - 15 yuan (in Huaihua)
Thermos - 20 yuan in Chongqing
Extension cord - 20 yuan in Chongqing. This thing increases comfort at work, because hotels don’t always have an outlet near the bed.
Raincoat - 4 yuan in Zhangjiajie
Sunburn remedy - 36 yuan in Haikou (hello, beach)

In Chongqing, I finally used the services of Chinese <b>hairdressers.</b> A men's haircut + styling costs only 26 yuan (4 dollars), they do it very well. Hair coloring + haircut costs 80 yuan, but only if the salon has the right color dye. If you want to dye your hair, for example, blonde (in China this is exotic), then it will cost 10 times more.
<img src="images/guide-china-38371827861_c704b0c4ee_o.jpg"/>
And finally, five of the juiciest places in April.
Longmen Grottoes - such a Chinese <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/336030.html">Vardzia</a>.
<img src="images/guide-china-26596257609_1f32b951b4_o.jpg"/>
Wulingyuan.
<img src="images/guide-china-26596257819_284c0569b7_o.jpg"/>
Chongqing is a gorgeous city. I was in Chongqing <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/299678.html">two years ago</a>, promised to return for a week, and so here we are.
<img src="images/guide-china-38341510112_1370b7381e_o.jpg"/>
Yangshuo. Yes, the place is touristy, but for good reason. On a bicycle you can go into the wilderness where there are not even cars.
<img src="images/guide-china-26596257529_73451125c3_o.jpg"/>
Hainan is a place for a beach holiday.
<img src="images/guide-china-26596258349_128c6fa745_o.jpg"/>

It will be no less interesting in May!

Today is the last day of May, so it's time to take stock. However, I decided that it would be wrong to mix different countries, so I will summarize the results for China.
I spent 84 days in China and visited 37 cities in 23 regions.

By days (more precisely by night, the night train is added to the city where the day was spent) in cities it turned out like this:
6 days - Shanghai, Chongqing
5 days - Beijing
4 days - Zhangjiajie, Xiamen, Nanjing
3 days - Heihe, Taishan, Xi'an, Luoyang, Guilin, Haikou, Sanya, Huangshan, Hangzhou
2 days - Harbin, Shenyang, Dandong, Dalian, Tianjin, Qufu, Jinan, Pingyao, Yangshuo
Day 1 - Changchun, Jilin, Yichang, Fenghuang, Huaihua, Guiyang, Nanning, Zhanjiang, Nanchang, Suzhou
0 days (transit) - Hengshui, Jishou, Jingdezhen

If we sum it up by region, counting my first two visits to China, it turns out like this:
27 days - Beijing
9 days - Guangdong
7 days - Chongqing, Shandong
6 days - Yunnan, Guangxi, Hunan, Liaoning, Hainan, Shanghai
5 days - Heilongjiang, Jiangsu
4 days - Fujian
3 days - Shaanxi, Henan, Anhui, Zhejiang, Hong Kong
2 days - Jirin, Shanxi, Sichuan, Tianjin
1 day - Guizhou, Hubei, Jiangxi, Macau
0 days - Hebei

In four provinces I was essentially passing through for 1 day. There is plenty to do in each of these provinces, but I focused on the more interesting neighboring regions. I was formally only in transit in Hebei province (I walked around the city of Hengshui in the evening), but the real highlight there is Beijing and Tianjin itself, around which this province is located (like the Moscow region). Frankly, there was little time for Sichuan in 2013. All regions where we spent more than 5 days can be considered quite familiar.

Expenses during this time amounted to $3,646, about $43 per day. May somewhat spoiled the statistics of March and April due to two factors: a flight from Sanya to Amoy for $200 and shopping in Shanghai: repairing equipment and purchasing some non-perishable items for future use, so as not to spend money on them in more expensive Korea.
