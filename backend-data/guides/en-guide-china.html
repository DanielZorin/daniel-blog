On March 1, 2015, I <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/363261.html">left Russia</a>. The first country on the long journey was China. I spent 84 days in China on that trip and visited 37 cities in 23 regions, and taking into account the trips in 2008 and 2013, it comes to 27 regions out of 33 (including Hong Kong and Macau, which can be considered separate countries). I have not been to the western, less populated regions only.

27 days - Beijing
9 days - Guangdong
7 days - Chongqing, Shandong
6 days - Yunnan, Guangxi, Hunan, Liaoning, Hainan, Shanghai
5 days - Heilongjiang, Jiangsu
4 days - Fujian
3 days - Shaanxi, Henan, Anhui, Zhejiang, Hong Kong
2 days - Jilin, Shanxi, Sichuan, Tianjin
1 day - Guizhou, Hubei, Jiangxi, Macau
0 days - Hebei

<b>Visa</b>
I got a 90-day business visa through a travel agency. A tourist visa is only valid for 30 or 60 days (double entry).
In 2024, it is more difficult to get a visa to China than it was in 2015. Previously, no documents were required through a travel agency, but now you need the same as for a Schengen visa - tickets, hotel reservations, etc. One of the advantages is that you can still get this visa outside your home country without a residence permit.

<b>Transport</b>
I traveled mainly by train. In China, there are high-speed trains and regular ones.
High-speed trains are the pride of China. The largest network in the world, built entirely in the 21st century. The entire eastern part of the country is penetrated by high-speed train lines along and across, in the west there are fewer lines, but you can even travel by train to Tibet (this is the highest mountain railway in the world). High-speed trains have two classes, in first class the seats are wider and tickets are 50% more expensive.
Regular trains have seats and berths. Seats are either simple (Hard seat) or improved (Soft seat), the latter are very rare, and I have never tried them. Berths are also divided into Hard sleeper (open sleeper with three levels of berths) and Soft sleeper (compartments with two levels of berths). Soft sleeper is ~50% more expensive than hard sleeper, so I have never tried it either. 
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257497084_d34b5ca002_o.jpg">
Slow-speed trains also have tickets without a seat, with which you can travel in a seated carriage in the aisle. I only traveled a short distance like this once. During peak periods like holidays, trains can get very crowded, but at normal times I was able to buy tickets with seats. In terms of prices for the same distance, it is usually the cheapest to take a regular seated train, then a hard sleeper, and the most expensive is a high-speed train. Since I was not in a hurry, I usually took the cheapest seated train to travel during the day. In addition, sleeping places are sold out faster. So, from Heihe to Harbin, two days before departure, there were no sleeper tickets, I had to travel the night in hard seet, it was terrible, worse than on a bus, but there was not much choice.
I bought train tickets at the station at the ticket office, typing in advance on my phone which train I needed and when. In 2024, everything changed in this regard - now there are no paper tickets, and you can buy online, including with a foreign passport, although on the <a href="https://www.12306.cn/">official website</a> they still don't seem to accept foreign cards.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256008926_663d11dd11_o.jpg">
Fares for travel in 2024:
Shanghai - Beijing, travel time from 4.5 to 6.5 hours on a high-speed train, regular trains only run at night.
Second class - from ~500 to ~660 yuan ($70-90)
First class - ~830-1060 yuan ($115-145)
Night train
Hard sleeper - 550
Soft sleeper - 660
Seated - ~160

Beijing - Tianjin, 30-60 minutes by high-speed train
Second class - 55-65
First class - 88-108
Hard seat on a slow train - 23

Harbin - Heihe, 12 hours (no high-speed trains)
Hard sleeper - 161
Soft sleeper - 244
Seated - 86

The most amazing thing is that the prices have not changed since 2015! I checked my records, in 2015 I paid exactly the same 86 yuan for a Harbin-Heihe ticket. Other routes that I compared differed by no more than 5%. Considering that the yuan exchange rate has fallen somewhat (now it is 7.26, used to be 6.2), it turns out that at least somewhere in the world it has become cheaper.

Train stations in China are similar in size to airports. Tickets are checked at the entrance to the station building, at the same time as the inspection of luggage, like in an airport. After that, inside the station you can freely go to your train.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256152646_baec96ec43_o.jpg">

I flew on an airplane several times. Air travel in China is very specific. The Chinese have their own system for storing reservations (not Amadeus, etc.) and a different pricing strategy. Usually prices skyrocket closer to departure, but in China, on the contrary, they offer discounts. The base price for a flight between two cities is fixed for all airlines (it's communism, after all), it's pretty exorbitant (around $300 for a 2-hour flight), and discounts are added to it, the biggest I've seen was 75%. So I bought a ticket from Chongqing to Guangzhou for about $60. And from Dalian to Tianjin it was about $40, cheaper than by train. It turns out that the main thing is to manage to get a ticket with a discount while there are still seats available.

Intercity buses in China are much more expensive than trains, almost twice as much. Buses have only one advantage: you don't have to buy tickets in advance. Sleeper buses with narrow bunk beds go for longer distances. 
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256539300_1a03ac7800_o.jpg">
Transportation around the city is quite cheap. One bus ride costs 1 or 2 yuan (more expensive in big cities). But the metro is more expensive - the ticket (token) price depends on the distance, and 2 yuan is the minimum. With the help of baidu maps, you can figure out the routes of city buses, which saves money (the bus is cheaper than the metro) and time.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255018042_efcf1f2e14_o.jpg">
Taxi in China is cheap, depending on the city, about 8-10 yuan for the first three kilometers, then 1.8 - 2.4 yuan per kilometer, 30% more expensive at night. A 10-kilometer trip will cost about 5 dollars. At train stations and attractions, taxi drivers may refuse to take you by the meter, then either reluctantly overpay, or go further to the wide road. Previously, you had to write out addresses on paper or show them on a city map, but in 2024, taxi apps like Uber are working (the most famous is Didi).

<b>Accomodation</b>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946230543_b27c71dda5_o.png" title=""/>
When I was in China in 2013, the price of 200 yuan per room seemed ridiculous to me: in Russia you couldn't always find rooms for 1000 rubles. In 2015, I lowered the bar to 100 yuan ($15). The general conclusion is this: for 80-100 yuan you can rent a <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/365781.html">luxury</a> (by Russian or European standards) room, but you'll have to spend some effort to find it. For 130-150 you can find one without problems at all and without bargaining. The cheapest accommodation can be rented for 50-60 yuan, but it will not be very comfortable. 
In general, accommodation starts at a ridiculous 20 yuan per room, but it is almost impossible for a foreigner to rent for such a price. The thing is that 99% of cheap hotels will immediately wave you off: "We do not accommodate foreigners." I tried to find out the reasons on the Internet. Apparently, at one time foreigners could only stay in reputable hotels with 4 stars or more. Then this restriction was lifted, now you can even couchsurf. In theory, the hotel should register the guest with the local immigration service (if you are staying at a private home, you need to go there yourself), and it seems that the administrators of cheap hotels simply do not want to deal with this. Nevertheless, sometimes you can check into a cheap hotel informally. From my observations, in small cities such as Jilin or Tai'an, this is easier, although there are exceptions, for example, Dandong. The worst situation is in the largest cities - Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing. I couldn't find cheap hotels there, and in the end I booked on booking or agoda. In tourist areas, on the contrary, there are no problems with checking in. Surprisingly, there were no problems in such unusual places as Huaihua, Nanning and Zhangjiang. On Hainan Island, you can stay in apartments, it's just like in Crimea, and <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/342944.html">Dubrovnik</a> you can rent a room from a granny right at the bus station.
Cheap hotels in China are comparable in comfort to cheap hotels in Russia or Latin America, more or less run-down rooms in the "Soviet" style. It is interesting that even the cheapest and most wretched hotels have rubber slippers and Wi-Fi. Most also have a kettle, and for some reason many have a computer instead of a TV. 
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945968101_6beb22d9dd_o.jpg" title=""/>
I usually didn't book hotels in advance. Usually you just leave the station and walk around the streets, preferably not the avenues, but the side streets. Regular trains arrive at central stations, located near the city center (unlike high-speed train stations, which are often on the outskirts), so the area around the station is logistically convenient. I mastered the baidu maps app on my phone, it can search for hotels around the current location, sort by price. If the price on baidu looks good, I just show the page on my phone at the reception, asking if there are such rooms. If I enter a hotel from the street, I just ask how much the room costs, you can haggle a little, knock down 10-20 yuan. 
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946305779_70f600cde1_o.png"/>
There is an unusual feature in Chinese hotels - when checking in, they always take a deposit of about 30-50% of the cost of the room per day, and return it upon check-out. When I first encountered this, I did not immediately understand why they asked me for more money than we agreed on.

Judging by what I saw on Agoda and on Baidu maps, in 2024, hotel prices have not increased much, standard chain hotels cost in the range of 100-170 yuan. It seems that there are more places available for online booking.

<b>Food</b>
I don't know what the prices are now for food. According to rumors, they have increased (unlike transport and hotels). But the taste, I think, has not changed, so except for the prices, my impressions should be relevant.
Getting to know Chinese cuisine completely changed my attitude to food in general, before that I had never eaten out so often, and did not eat much street food either. I still love Chinese food very much and sometimes go to Chinese restaurants in different countries, fortunately there are a lot of Chinese abroad, and it is not so difficult to find an authentic place.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4531/38317135886_91ef765720_o.jpg" title=""/>

There is a huge amount of street food in China (as in other East Asian countries). The most basic is skewers (in Chinese chuan, the hieroglyph 串 speaks for itself). They can be made not only from meat, but also from mushrooms, squid, etc. Skewers cost 1-3 yuan. Sometimes they sell some noodles on the streets, for 5 yuan - a kind of business lunch for passers-by.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945954026_992b9dc082_o.jpg" />
Sweet snacks are also sold on the streets: in the north of China, these are the legendary caramelized fruits. In the south, they are less common, more often it's just fruits like pineapples on a stick. In general, there are a lot of fruits in China, there are all the fruits from Southeast Asia, especially durian and mangosteen, although they are more expensive. But durians are imported even to the far north, you can buy them in a supermarket. 
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4546/38317154256_399314d9e5_o.jpg" />
There are a huge number of places to eat in China. Generally, there are two types of establishments. One group is focused on "business lunches", that is, people who come to eat a conventional plate of noodles. There is usually a small menu, long tables, like in a canteen, no interior. Other establishments are focused on sitting in the evening with friends. They have typical round tables with a rotating glass stand, and a huge menu with dozens of dishes. If you come with a large group, you can order many dishes and eat a little from each. But you can just come to eat, basic dishes cost a standard 20-25 yuan. The simplest eateries serve different types of noodles and dumplings. A meat dish costs 20-30 yuan. Noodles and soups cost 5-10 yuan: if there is no meat, then it's 5 (some soups even cost 3), if there is meat, then 8-10. Vegetable dishes are also usually around 10. Chinese dumplings are about half a yuan each, served in portions of 8-10 pieces. The menu, of course, is only in Chinese. Baidu translate can translate well, often even a photo of the dish is loaded. In some places there are photos of dishes on the walls, as a rule, there are only photos of more expensive dishes, cheap ones are only on the menu. 
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4585/37658064534_e53577edf3_o.jpg" />

I really liked the canteens in China where you cook your own soup. It is unusual in that the price is fixed for each portion of each ingredient. Usually, they sell by weight - 20-24 yuan per kilogram, put whatever you want. As far as I understand, this soup is called "Malatang" (three characters on the right side of the sign). Hot Pot works on a similar principle - a dish originally from Chongqing. Only there the soup is cooked right on your table, and you order the ingredients from the menu.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4545/38371953991_110f34c5d2_o.jpg" />
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4562/26596406809_c26e2b2e13_o.jpg" />

Now let's look at a higher-level establishment - with an extensive menu. Usually the menu looks something like this (this is an example from the city of Jishou). Cheap dishes for 10 yuan or less are vegetarian. Meat dishes cost 16-20. I don't know all the hieroglyphs, but the main ingredient of the dish is always listed at the end. Most often it's meat, fish, eggs. Sometimes there is liver, kidneys and other intestines, the corresponding hieroglyphs usually have the "moon" radical 月 on the left, and I tried to avoid them in every possible way, because I hate liver.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945054437_6cf104a931_o.jpg" />
My favorite dish is meat with shiitake mushrooms (xianggu chaorou). For some reason, these mushrooms are the most common.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4572/38317139076_b6f5460e84_o.jpg" />
In general, "meat with X" is the essence of the names of most non-vegetarian dishes. Meat is usually cut into long, narrow pieces. Often the dish is the meat itself, and the side dish should be ordered separately. It is curious that rice is usually brought at the end - if you are not full, you can catch up with rice. 
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4539/37658061504_493f2e73cf_o.jpg" />

<b>Other</b>
Of the other expenses, the most was spent on the Internet: I bought a 3G SIM card for $48 (300 yuan) from China Unicom. 3 gigabytes for six months (+ another 9 gigabytes in the province where the card was purchased, they remained in Harbin). I was just starting to work remotely then, the first time I bought a SIM card abroad. It's funny that 1 GB per month was enough for me then. Now, of course, the Internet is much cheaper, for 80-120 yuan you can get several dozen gigabytes.
In Chongqing, we used the services of Chinese <b>hairdressers.</b> A men's haircut + styling costs only 26 yuan (4 dollars), they do it very well. Hair coloring + haircut costs 80 yuan, but only if the salon has the dye of the desired color. If you want to dye your hair, for example, blonde (in China this is exotic), then it will cost as much as 10 times more.

<b>Attractions</b>
In China, attractions are quite expensive, the most popular places cost $20-40 to enter. Some places can be visited for half price if you call yourself a student. Prices for attractions in 2024 remained more or less the same, some even became a little cheaper.
China is divided into 33 regions.

<b>Heilongjiang</b> is the northernmost cold region. The capital Harbin is the largest city in the north, it has preserved some historical architecture from the times of the Russian Empire.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946427050_0c56e8032b_o.jpg">
I also visited the small city of Heihe on the border with Russia.
<b>Jilin</b> is a little further south. The largest city Changchun was the capital of the puppet pro-Japanese Manchuria during World War II.

The capital Jilin (Girin) is popular with tourists in winter because of the trees on which frost freezes beautifully.
<b>Liaoning</b> is another province of Manchuria. It is home to the historic capital, Shenyang, with the palace of the Manchu emperors before they captured Beijing in the 17th century.
Dandong is an interesting city because it is located on the border with North Korea, you can see it across the river. There is also a little-known section of the Great Wall nearby.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946305889_f2c8f49be6_o.jpg">
Dalian is the second city founded by Russians in the 19th century. Neighboring Lüshun is the historic Port Arthur.
<b>Beijing</b> is the capital. There are many attractions here and the most easily accessible section of the Wall.
<b>Tianjin</b> is a large city near Beijing, with an interesting history and colonial architecture
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946230518_689690edda_o.jpg">
<b>Hebei</b> is a region around Beijing and Tianjin, I was there mostly in transit.
<b>Shandong</b> is an interesting coastal region. In addition to the capital city of Jinan, I visited Qufu, the birthplace of the philosopher Confucius. I also climbed the sacred mountain of Taishan.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945068387_3f6c3a5029_o.jpg">
There is also an interesting city of Qingdao with colonial architecture and seaside resorts.
<b>Shanxi</b>. In this region, I have only been to one city - Pingyao. The city is very interesting and colorful, one of the best preserved historical cities in China.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946427085_f071089606_o.jpg">
There is also a second historical city of Datong and Mount Wutai.
<b>Shaanxi</b> (actually also Shanxi, only with a different tone, in English transcription they are written Shanxi and Shaanxi for the difference). Here is the popular city of Xi'an - the border of the Muslim part of China. There is also the famous Terracotta Army
<b>Henan</b>. Here I was in the city of Luoyang, famous for its cave temples.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946230493_0ea4103ccf_o.jpg"/>
Also in that region is the historical capital of Kaifeng and the Shaolin Monastery.
<b>Hubei</b> is a province on the Yangtze River. I did not go to the capital Wuhan then, since it was not on the way, and later this city became famous throughout the world thanks to the Institute of Virology. I was in the second city of the region - Yichang. Also you can go on a cruise along the Yangtze River, or you can visit the Wudang Mountains.
<b>Anhui</b>. Here are the Yellow Mountains (Huangshan), one of the most popular landscapes in China.
<b>Jiangsu</b>. Nanjing is the southern capital, a large and important city.
Suzhou is a city famous for its canals and classical gardens, often visited from Shanghai for a stroll.
<b>Zhejiang</b>. Hangzhou is located here, a city with a famous lake.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256164121_a6a2dcb282_o.jpg">
<b>Shanghai</b> is the largest and most cosmopolitan city in China.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256536125_e535a1a0b1_o.jpg">
<b>Jiangxi</b>. I passed through the capital city of Nanchang, as well as the center of porcelain production - Jingdezhen.
<b>Fujian</b>. I visited the city of Xiamen - one of the most unusual megalopolises in China, with colonial architecture. Nearby is the island of Gulangyu, where foreign ambassadors lived. 
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256492459_b1c7eb0b52_o.jpg">
<b>Guangdong</b>. The most populated province, where a significant part of the industry is concentrated, historically this is the region from which trade and shipping came. Next to the autonomous Hong Kong and Macau there is a continuous strip of colossal multi-million cities flowing into each other. The capital Guangzhou has a lot of attractions and a rich history.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255422292_36055f4ea0_o.jpg">
Shenzhen on the border with Hong Kong has grown from scratch in 40 years, one of the most skyscraper-filled cities in China.
<b>Hunan</b>. Probably one of the most beautiful provinces, there are solid mountains, including the most popular mountains from the movie Avatar - Zhangjiajie National Park.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946230488_5eb4f05f93_o.jpg"/>
I also visited the picturesque historical town of Fenghuang.
<b>Guizhou</b>. In this region, I was passing through the capital Guiyang. Like Hunan, there are also picturesque mountains here, but there are no top attractions.
<b>Guangxi</b>. People come here for the karst landscapes in the area of ​​the cities of Guilin and Yangshuo.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945968056_154e526b32_o.jpg"/>
<b>Chongqing</b>. Probably my favorite city in China. With the most picturesque crazy landscapes with skyscrapers, interchanges, slums and steep cliffs along the river banks.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945068297_42a080a51a_o.jpg"/>
<b>Sichuan</b>. The birthplace of the panda, you can see the panda breeding center in Chengdu.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256009441_0bcec3e83b_o.jpg">
Further to the west there are many mountains and even a piece of Tibet, some go to those parts to see Tibet without the need to obtain a permit.
<b>Yunnan</b> is the backpacker province in China, just adjacent to Southeast Asia. Near the capital Kunming there is an unusual karst (Stone Forest)
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255557686_766a8c80f7_o.jpg">
Further north there are many beautiful small towns (Dali, Lijiang, Shangri-La), as well as high mountains.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255699948_4ce576d917_o.jpg">
<b>Hainan</b> is an island with beach resorts, there are quite nice beaches on the southern coast.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946427025_ed9393f9ff_o.jpg"/>
<b>Hong Kong</b> and <b>Macau</b> are special regions that are usually considered separate countries because they have a special visa-free entry regime.

Regions I haven't been to:
<b>Inner Mongolia</b> is a huge steppe province along the border with Mongolia
<b>Ningxia</b> is a very small province with no special attractions
<b>Gansu</b> is where the Wall ends and has a lot of mountainous and desert landscapes.
<b>Qinghai</b> is on the way to Tibet.
<b>Xinjiang</b> is the largest region, culturally close to Central Asia. In addition to mosques and lagman, it is notorious for its "re-education sanatoriums" and total surveillance.
<b>Tibet</b> is an interesting region, but problematic for tourism, since you can only go there with an organized tour.

<b>Results</b>
I estimated a budget of $30 per day for two, as it turned out, such a budget is realistic if you save on everything. If you do not save, it turns out to be $40 per day. I do not take into account such opportunities as hitchhiking and couchsurfing, since I am not sure that I could work with this format of travel.
$1 = 6.2 yuan.
Expenses for the entire time amounted to $3646, about $43 per day.
