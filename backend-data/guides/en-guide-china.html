My second month in China has ended. I can now speak Chinese orally, I understand half the menu in a restaurant, I know my way around Chinese cities perfectly, and the number of regions I have visited in China has exceeded half.

By the way, initially I thought that some regions, such as Guizhou and Fujian, would have to be skipped, but in the end the plans neatly worked out so that I would get to all regions except the western ones (the plan for May is marked in yellow). This is the system! You can't hitchhike in three weeks from Urumqi to the Vietnamese border. I now know the typical dishes and sweets of different regions and can even distinguish the Beijing dialect from the Chongqing dialect by ear.
As a result, the April route looks like this:

Work made some adjustments to my plans, so in Guilin and Yangshuo there were two days when I went out for a walk at 3-4 pm, and worked from the very morning.
Expenses for the month amounted to  $1233 (for two). That is, <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/369405.html">unlike March</a> we barely missed $40 a day.

For convenience, I made a Cash flow statement in gnucash:

<b>Housing</b> was more expensive this month than last, by an average of $1 per day. At night it went like this:
Luoyang - 2 nights
Train Luoyang-Yichang - 1 night
Yichang - 1 night
Zhangjiajie - 4 nights
Fenghuang - 1 night
Huaihua - 1 night
Chongqing - 5 nights
Train Chongqing-Guiyang - 1 night
Guiyang - 1 night
Guilin - 2 nights
Yangshuo - 2 nights
Guilin - 1 night
Nanning - 1 night
Zhanjiang - 1 night
Haikou - 3 nights
Sanya - 3 nights

I feel like since I started speaking Chinese in hotels, checking in has become a little easier, however, there are still problems with a foreign passport. The biggest problems were in Luoyang (where, due to heavy rain, we ended up staying at the most expensive hotel for the month) and Chongqing, the largest city. In Chongqing, I tried to rent an apartment or a room in apartment buildings near the station, there are a lot of people walking around with “room for rent” signs. They even wanted to rent out one room to me, but there was no internet there. At first they seemed to settle in another place, but then they changed their minds. In the end, I went to the address of the cheapest hostel from booking.com and lowered the price a little more. But the hostel had a washing machine, which allowed us to wash absolutely all our clothes at once and without much effort.
In tourist places there are no problems with check-in. Surprisingly, there were no problems in such unusual places as Huaihua, Nanning and Zhangjiang. On the island of Hainan you can live in the private sector, just like in Crimea and <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/342944.html">Dubrovnik</a> you can rent a room from your grandmother right at the bus station.

Spending on <b>food</b> increased slightly this month, primarily on non-restaurant food. There is a logical explanation for this - in snowy Harbin at -15 there was simply nothing to buy or eat on the streets, but here in the south, pineapples, mangoes and other fruits are sold everywhere, and because of the heat, ice cream is constantly in use. Every time you think that you have already tried all the street snacks and sweets, something else unimaginable begins to be sold in a new city. Sweet-glazed apples, ubiquitous in the north and center, have been replaced by pineapples and watermelon on a stick.

I even thought about trying lobster. The smallest one here costs 100 yuan per piece, you can get a larger one for 130. The price by weight is 200 yuan ($35) per kilogram, but the problem is that a kilogram of lobster produces very little meat, it is essentially only in the tail. I decided to postpone this pampering for another time.

With <b>travel</b> I didn’t discover anything particularly new compared to last month. All the same trains and planes. Once we took a ferry ride to Hainan Island (42 yuan - $7). Once we were late for a train in Guilin, it turned out that in such a situation it was possible to change the ticket for the next train, paying only the difference in price. The negative difference, however, is not returned. The cashier said that you can change the ticket once.
Of all the cities in April, only Chongqing has a metro, but I traveled more by buses. City bus transport was also used in Luoyang, Yichang, Guilin, Haikou and Sanya. We only took a taxi once in Chongqing so as not to miss the train.

<b>Entertainment</b> this month is as follows:
Grottoes in Luoyang - 120 yuan. Not cheap, but worth it, there's a lot to see.
Wulingyuan National Park ("Avatar Mountains") - 248 yuan. Alena asked for a student card for 160. $40 is not cheap, but with this ticket you can go to the park for three days in a row, so it’s not that expensive for a day, and there is something to see there for all three days, even if the weather is good. Apart from entrance tickets, we didn’t pay for anything else in the park; all the cable cars and funiculars (and one-way travel on them, including the descent, costs about $15) can easily be reached by stairs for 30-60 minutes. After Mount Taishan it is just an easy walk.
Fenghuang - just for entering the streets of the old city they want as much as 150 yuan, but there are no ticket takers on some side streets in the far part of the city. I easily found two entrances, one in the east and one in the west, through which I could, if necessary, bypass the ticket office.
Chongqing Southern Hot Springs - 44 yuan for entry. There are pools with warm mineral water, like in <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/365885.html">Tyumen</a>. There are many other springs in the city, but they are either much further from the center or much more expensive.
Guilin and Yangshuo. There are a lot of tourists in this area, including foreign ones, which is why people here like to charge money for every sneeze. You need to be careful not to go broke. So, in Guilin they want 70 yuan to look at one rock in the city center! On the opposite side of the river, more trees were specially planted so that it would be impossible to take photographs, and the area was fenced off with two rows of barbed wire. However, the rock can still be seen through the trees or from the river bank a little further away. In another park (Chuanshan) they wanted as much as 80 yuan for entry, although the Chinese seemed to get in for free. As it turned out later, on the other side of the park there is not even a ticket office, there is just a village with fields, very colorful by the way. We climbed the hill along the path from the back side, but there was no through passage into the park. When we got down, it was already 5 o’clock, and the ticket office had simply closed, so we could go into the park just like that.
In Yangshuo, the main tourist street is West Street, there are a lot of restaurants with menus in English, the atmosphere is sad, everything is expensive and not authentic. But closer to the bus station you can find accommodation and food at reasonable prices. There you can rent a bicycle for 20 yuan per day (in the center they will charge 50-70) and ride around the surrounding villages. Paid places were in Moon Hill (15 yuan, a very simple climb to the rock), where we got there by bicycle, and on the hill with the TV tower in the city center (10 yuan, it seems, not quite officially).

In Xi'an we left our winter clothes, and as luck would have it, we were immediately struck by cold for 10 days. In the southern part of China there is no central heating, and due to the high humidity, +10 feels like frost. In Zhangjiajie you had to sleep under two blankets without getting out. Warm weather arrived only in Chongqing.
From <b>other expenses</b>:
Swimming trunks - 25 yuan at Walmart in Chongqing
Umbrella - 15 yuan (in Huaihua)
Thermos - 20 yuan in Chongqing
Extension pilot - 20 yuan in Chongqing. This thing increases comfort at work, because hotels don’t always have an outlet near the bed.
Raincoat - 4 yuan in Zhangjiajie
Sunburn remedy - 36 yuan in Haikou (hello, beach)

In Chongqing, they finally used the services of Chinese <b>hairdressers.</b> A men's haircut + styling costs only 26 yuan (4 dollars), they do it very well. Hair coloring + haircut costs 80 yuan, but only if the salon has the right color dye. If you want to dye your hair, for example, blonde (in China this is exotic), then it will cost 10 times more.

And finally, five of the juiciest places in April.
Longmen Grottoes - such a Chinese <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/336030.html">Vardzia</a>.
<img src="images/guide-china-26596257609_1f32b951b4_o.jpg"/>
Wulingyuan.
<img src="images/guide-china-26596257819_284c0569b7_o.jpg"/>
Chongqing is a gorgeous city. I was in Chongqing <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/299678.html">two years ago</a>, promised to return for a week, and so here we are.
<img src="images/guide-china-38341510112_1370b7381e_o.jpg"/>
Yangshuo. Yes, the place is pop, but for good reason. On a bicycle you can go into the wilderness where there are not even cars.
<img src="images/guide-china-26596257529_73451125c3_o.jpg"/>
Hainan is a place for a beach holiday.

It will be no less interesting in May!
