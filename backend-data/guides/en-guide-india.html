This is the second part of the review of India, which I had to split in two due to restrictions on the length of the post in LiveJournal. It will be about food, the Internet, attractions, general impressions and financial results.

<b>Food</b>
This is my main disappointment in India. I thought it would be very good, like in China or Thailand, but it turned out to be very mediocre.
Indian cuisine is very monotonous. It seems that India is big, there are many different peoples and languages, but in reality their food is no different, no comparison with China, where the cuisine of different provinces is noticeably different. A restaurant may sometimes even be called “Punjabi” or “Hyderabadi”, but the menu will be the same everywhere; I can list all 40-50 Indian dishes with my eyes closed. It’s funny that in the north the menu will have a “South Indian” section (that’s right, not Karnataka/Kerala/Tamilnadu, but all of southern India), which usually contains dosa flatbreads, but in southern India they will be along with everything for the rest, that's all the difference. Here's a typical menu.

This restaurant is located in Mumbai in the middle of the Dharavi slum, so the prices are slightly below average. The maximum number of dishes is presented here: about 20 chicken dishes, the same number from lamb (Mutton), and another 20 vegetarian ones, many of them differing only by replacing chicken with lamb or with cheese (Paneer) in the vegetarian version. A separate item is "tandoori" - grilled chicken, and "biryani" - a rice dish reminiscent of spicy pilaf. On the second page there are “Chinese” dishes, which resemble real Chinese dishes a little less than nothing, but are quite good, I especially quote Chicken Machurian and Hakka noodles. There is still a missing section for “thali” - this is a combo lunch of small portions of several dishes.

Pork and beef are almost impossible to find in restaurants, although the meat itself is sold in the respective ethnic areas. Beef, by the way, is not prohibited in itself; it is forbidden to kill cows, but only in some states in the north and west. In the central and southern states, you can kill bulls, but not cows. In Kerala and the northeastern states, anything is possible.
In coastal cities, fish and shrimp appear on the menu. They don't exist in cities in the interior of the country.
There are several problems with food. Firstly, there are few restaurants. Very little. Here's an example: the road from my hotel in Mumbai to the Chinese n' Grill restaurant (by the way, a decent place, prices are slightly higher than average, but worth it). 800 meters is not 10 minutes, but rather 15, because you need to squeeze through the crowd and dodge motorcycles, and there is simply nothing closer (there is only one, but it is vegetarian). This is the very center of Mumbai; in less dense cities, it happened that I spent an hour looking for somewhere to eat.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-india-119893_original.png" title=""/>
Secondly, a significant portion of restaurants are vegetarian, and the bigger the hole you are in, the more significant this portion is. For example, in Goa almost every establishment has meat, but in the small town of Vapi in the center I found only one establishment where I could eat something other than vegetables (although there were only three vegetarian ones there too). Vegetarian food is mostly tasteless and triple monotonous, because there will be only 20 dishes. And if you think that vegetarian food is salads of fresh cucumbers with tomatoes and lettuce, then I will disappoint you. In India, vegetarian dishes consist mainly of all sorts of unleavened beans, peas and other things that are somehow not very good to eat in large quantities. Even potatoes are not always available. And eggs, by the way, are not included in the vegetarian diet, although it cannot be called vegan in the Western sense of the word, because there is milk and cheese. In general, if the first month I devoured vegetarian thali, then by the end of the third, just the word “vegetarianism” makes me shake.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-india-121604_original.jpg" title=""/>
Thirdly, the food is not always tasty. In Thailand and China, I have never come across a place where the food was bad and tasteless. India is full of places at the level of Soviet canteens. As a rule, all establishments in the lower price range are terrible, despite the fact that the difference between the “lower” and the “middle” in price is small. For example, a vegetarian thali in the cheapest establishment can be found for 50-60 rupees ($1), and on average it will cost about 120 ($2), but for 50 your thali will have two or three dishes instead of six, they will not be tasty and heavily diluted with water, the contents will generally be about zero, like one piece of potato floating in the sauce. Only they will give you the same amount of rice as for 120.
An example of lunch from the lowest price range: this establishment doesn’t even have a menu, only this one option to eat costs 60 rupees. Only good for filling your belly with rice and a minimum amount of vegetables. People from Russia, not accustomed to spicy food, would say that it was also too spicy. By the way, this is supposed to be eaten with your hands, although eating rice with your hands is, to put it mildly, inconvenient. It's good that I had a spoon with me.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-india-125161_original.jpg" title=""/>
Towards the end, I was so fed up with all these sauces and the long search for restaurants that I began to constantly go to McDonald's and Burger King whenever possible. In general, these establishments in India are more expensive than their Russian counterparts. Indian McDuck is pretty bad. There is no beef, instead only chicken or vegetarian substitutes. Chicken cutlets are tasteless. An analogue of the Big Mac is called “Maharaja Mac”, it costs about 3 dollars (in Russia a Big Mac costs $2, in Malaysia $2.5 with almost free potatoes and cola), and there are so many hot peppers that even I couldn’t eat, I had to pick them out all the pepper is from the burger, which has never happened to me in my life. At McDuck, I usually got the cheapest Mac Egg burger, which costs about 30 rupees (the sign says 25, but there is about 20% tax added). Burger King is cheaper than McDuck and much tastier, closer to its counterparts in other countries in terms of taste. The maximum combo with a chicken Whopper costs 258 rupees (combo with Maharaja Mac - 310), there is also a Whopper with lamb for 30 rupees more. For 164 rupees you can get a maximum combo with a small chicken burger. Unfortunately, Burger King is much smaller than McDonald's. KFC in India is expensive and very tasteless - nothing like the classic KFC taste, just very spicy chicken.

A few words about cleanliness and poisoning. I was seriously poisoned twice in 82 days: the first time I even had to spend one day in bed, the second time I only drank charcoal and phthalazole tablets. I don’t think it’s about the food: Alena and I always ate together, and we had poisonings on different days. Rather, the problem is my lack of the habit of obsessively washing my hands: I wash them only in the toilet and before eating in a restaurant (and then only if there is a washbasin), and, say, if I want to eat a couple of cookies on the go, then I never I'm bothered. In a normal country, this is enough: just as if you washed your hands after using the toilet, and after that they are more or less clean, touching the door handle or the handrail of an escalator will not get you dirty. In India, as you can see, once a month you can make a mess.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-india-122849_original.jpg" title=""/>
Now about food in stores. This is all very, very bad. It’s clear that there won’t be large supermarkets in any Cambodian village, but it’s somehow strange when in a city with a population of 10 million there are only five. In St. Petersburg, within a five-minute walk from my house, there were five supermarkets, in each of which, despite the small area of sales floors (two or three rooms), the choice of goods was several times greater than in Indian “hypermarkets”, reminiscent of Soviet stores from photographs from 1991, where long shelves are stacked in a single layer of the same product. The only supermarket with a normal selection of goods by our standards is the German chain Spar, which is located in only 7 cities. In particular, in Delhi there are only 4 of them per 20 million population, in Chennai - one per 7 million. Can you imagine that in Moscow there will be four stores for the entire city, and all the rest of the shopping will be only in stalls near the metro? Welcome to India!
For snacks, I constantly bought Limca soda (35-40 rupees for 600 ml), peanuts (5-10 rupees), several types of cookies (20-30 rupees), chips (10-20 rupees for a small pack). Instant noodles in India are called Maggi, cost 12 rupees, and only one brand is more or less common. Having a couple of bags in your stash is a good idea because if you arrive in a new city after 9-10 pm, everything will be closed and you won’t be able to find other food.
The price is indicated on the packaging of all factory goods, but at small points it can be rounded to the nearest ten due to the eternal lack of change.
With fruits in India there is no problem. There are no exotic ones. There are apples that cost three times more than in Russia (from 150 rupees per kilo); small sour tasteless mangoes; good pomegranates (80-100 rupees per kilo), which I mostly ate; bananas (3-5 rupees each).
<img alt="" src="images/guide-india-121182_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Internet</b>
In India, Wi-Fi is ONLY with a passport. In Russia, everything was based on this law, but in India you can’t dance. You can check into a hotel only with your passport, so they will simply give you a password there, as usual. At airports, train stations, and McDonald's, you will definitely need to enter an SMS password, and for this, most likely, you need a local SIM card (although Russian numbers are also rolled out at Delhi airport).
To buy a SIM card, you need to have a 3 by 4 photo with you and fill out a form. At first, the SIM card doesn’t even see the network, after a while (up to a day) it will connect, but for the Internet to work, you need to call a special short number and answer the questions of the robot, which will ask for your date of birth and the last digits of your passport number. Something was wrong with one of my SIM cards, I had to switch to a live operator, but in the end everything worked. I doubt that in a remote province they know how to properly sell SIM cards to foreigners, so it’s better to solve this issue in Delhi/Mumbai, but not at the airport, because at the airport the price is stupidly raised five times (I was told 1 gigabyte for 1200 rupees, although it costs 179 + the SIM card itself is a bit).
The SIM card itself costs 50-100 rupees. There are just a lot of tariffs, there are also 6-7 operators, some of them are in the process of merging. Previously, each operator worked only in part of the states, and it turned out that in each specific state there were 3-4 operators out of 6, and always different. Now everything seems to be simplified; the main operators have de facto canceled roaming within the country. I used two SIM cards from major operators: Airtel (the first) and Vodafone (either the second or the third). The Internet worked in all regions at the same home region rates (as far as I know, only in Kashmir it will not work). My home region was Delhi because that's where I bought these cards. In theory, prices are higher in Delhi, so if you buy in Agra, which is in the poorest state of Uttar Pradesh, it should be a little cheaper. But in general, Internet tariffs are quite divine. From Airtel I bought 1 gigabyte for 28 days for 179 rupees. I recommend this operator. Vodafone is worse - the network is worse, more expensive (1 gigabyte is more than 250 rupees), there is also a strange division into 3G and 4G, on some tariffs half of the traffic is only 4G, if your phone does not support it, you will not have this half.
You can top up your account at any stall that displays logos of mobile operators or sells phones. If you put 100 rupees, a little more than 80 comes into your account due to tax (on July 1, 2017, India underwent a large-scale tax reform, a single sales tax was introduced instead of many old taxes such as VAT, because of this everything has become a little more expensive).

<b>General impressions</b>
There are a lot of negative reviews about India from the series “How shocking the piles of garbage on the streets are,” probably because people often come there who have never been to such places before, and in contrast to Europe, India looks shocking. On the contrary, in the first days I was surprised at what an ordinary country it was. Well, the streets in Myanmar are dirtier, the slums in the Philippines are cooler, not to mention Haiti. There is so little unusual color in India, only cows walk the streets, and it is very difficult to find anything else original, not like in Yangon (<a href="">read my story</a>). I would compare traveling around India with traveling through small provincial industrial half-abandoned cities of Russia with a population of 10-20 thousand people: the beauty of the city landscapes and the range of entertainment are approximately at the same level.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-india-120786_original.jpg" title=""/>
But India ultimately taught me something. You can go to <a href="">Sweden</a> or <a href="">France</a> to see how to properly arrange your life to make it comfortable and cozy. And India is Sweden in reverse, a complete collection of examples of how not to live. You may object: “So it’s the same in <a href="href">Bangladesh</a>!” To this I will answer that, firstly, it’s not exactly the same, and secondly, there is little demand from Bangladesh, East Timor, Haiti and other assholes of the world: these are small countries without useful resources at the end of the world, and India is kind of like the second country in the world in terms of population and strenuously laying claim to the status of one of the world powers, this is a different weight category.
Let's briefly summarize the main points.
E - efficiency. Anyone who works in the IT field has heard many jokes about Indian programmers. I dare to assure you that this is all for a reason. The organization of business processes here is excellent. Trains are hours late, long questionnaires with meaningless questions are held in high esteem, for fun they build a subway in an industrial zone, they put operators in front of automatic machines, you can list all the absurdity for a long time.
K - comfort. Indians have a very small comfort zone, even smaller than Russians and Americans. For an Indian, everything beyond the threshold of the house is not just foreign, but almost enemy, where you can throw garbage and piss on the walls. Even richer people do not consider it shameful to throw a candy wrapper out the window of a train or car. For the same reason, the cultural heritage is in a terrible state: if it is not a monument of national importance, which is surrounded by a fence and paid entrance, then they do not restore anything, they do not try to preserve its beauty.
R - performance. While in Indonesia the working day begins at almost six in the morning, in India even McDonald's opens at 10-11. Everything closes early too, after 9 the cities die out. There are twice as many parasite guards and paper stampers than even in Russia. The speed of work in India is also fantastic: only here they managed to prepare an order of scrambled eggs and chopped tomatoes in an empty restaurant for more than 40 minutes.
<i>The center of a city of ten million, a herd of goats are being driven along the street</i>
<img alt="" src="images/guide-india-121887_original.jpg" title=""/>
P - paranoia. In India, officials and rulers see terrorists under every plinth. Apart from the standard Pakistanis who want to take over the state of Kashmir, there are all sorts of other marginal groups. Indira Gandhi was killed by the Sikhs, Rajiv Gandhi a few years later by the Tamil freedom fighters of Sri Lanka. The further into the forest, the greater the paranoia; since the 1990s, journalism in the country has been virtually banned, even the activities of the government are covered very sparingly. Being a journalist in India is like being gay in Russia. Camera phobia is flourishing, which sometimes takes on simply absurd proportions; for example, it may be prohibited to take photographs in an ordinary city park. And yes, in India they also imprison you for likes and reposts.
U - despondency. Above, I compared India with a remote Russian province. What do we do for fun in these places? Vodka. In India, by the way, this problem is also very acute, where drunken husbands also beat their wives en masse (and sometimes pour acid on them, because in India acid is sold everywhere as a cleaning agent). Entertainment such as taking a walk in the park, going to a restaurant, hanging out in a club or going to the theater in India, if available in the largest cities, is in absolutely negligible quantities. The life of the vast majority of people is hopeless and consists of the church and substances: khat for the poorest (half of the food stalls sell only khat) and alcohol for the slightly richer people. India is a country where people do not smile; I have never seen such a concentration of gloomy, gloomy faces anywhere else.

You will say: “Shanti! All this can be experienced.” Of course, I lived there for three months, and I didn’t even stop enjoying visiting beautiful places, which will be discussed in the next section. But in order to endure all these shortcomings, there must be something to endure for, right? In Indian cities, you don't want to stay a minute longer than you need to see the main attractions. There are only two places I am ready to come again without stretching: Mumbai and Goa, although they also lose competition with Bangkok or Kuala Lumpur.


<b>Attractions</b>
<b>Delhi</b> is the capital, an unattractive city, in which, however, many monuments from different eras remain. Convenient to travel by metro.
<b>Amritsar</b> is the only place in India where there is a pedestrian tourist street, like in Europe. Apart from her and the Sikh temple there is not much else to see. You can go to the Pakistani border for a show.
<b>Dharamsala</b> is a village in the mountains where the Dalai Lama lives in exile. It's nice to spend a couple of days in a cool climate.
<b>Shimla</b> is a city with beautiful panoramic views, but not so pleasant up close. Expensive housing. Here is one of the old narrow-gauge mountain railways, an alternative to Darjeeling.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-india-127711_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Chandigarh</b> is a typical Soviet city with wide avenues and commercial blocks.
<b>Agra</b> - Taj Mahal, many slums. The curious town of Fatehpur Sikri is about 30 kilometers to the west.
<b>Khajuraho</b> is a very colorful village with famous temples decorated with erotic sculptures. Good place.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-india-127216_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Varanasi</b> is the ugliest hole where they try to sell hard drugs on every corner.
<b>Gaya</b> - there, nearby, Buddha reached enlightenment. You can look at Buddhist temples in the style of different countries.
<b>Puri</b> is a city with a poor beach. It’s difficult to call it a resort, more like a hole by the sea.
<b>Kolkata</b> is one of the most interesting cities in India. Built by the British, so it looks like a city, not a large village. Lots of colonial architecture. There's a lot of old-world coloring, like people with typewriters on the streets. Lots of screaming poverty.
<b>Cochin</b> is a nice city with remnants of colonial heritage.
<b>Goa</b> is the most pleasant place in India. A huge amount of Portuguese architecture throughout the state, Old Goa with churches, forts, green hills. Quite clean. Lots of restaurants with good food. Comfortable hotels (more expensive than in the rest of India, though). As a beach resort - completely zero level of Crimea with the same density of people.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-india-126311_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Mumbai</b> is a cool city. Pretentious colonial architecture, but in much better condition than in Calcutta. Civilized looking center. The only place in India with world class shopping experience. Famous slums.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-india-119581_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Thiruvananthapuram</b> is a medium-sized village.
<b>Kanyakumari</b> is the southernmost point of India. It looks like a resort in Abkhazia that was abandoned about 30 years ago.
<b>Madurai</b> is supposedly the oldest city in India, but in fact there is only one large famous temple.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-india-127361_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Tiruchrappalli</b> - I was passing through and discovered a nice temple on a huge rock.
<b>Pondicherry</b> is a French colony. There is much less left than in the Portuguese colonies, but still not bad.
<b>Chennai</b> is a big city of average lousiness. There are several interesting places.
<b>Bangalore</b> is the most civilized city, almost on a par with Mumbai. There are offices of IT companies here.
<b>Hyderabad</b> - cool Golconda fort, some Muslim architecture.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-india-126582_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Aurangabad</b> - cave temples of Ellora, the tomb of Emperor Akbar, a luxurious fort in Daulatabad, a copy of the Taj Mahal. An excellent concentration of interesting places for a small town.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-india-125839_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Daman</b> is a little-known Portuguese colony. Two forts, a lot of old architecture, and not like in Goa.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-india-126198_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Silvassa</b> is an even lesser-known Portuguese colony near Daman. Almost nothing has survived.
<b>Ahmedabad</b> is an unexpectedly interesting city with beautiful courtyards and alleys. Probably the most beautiful of the “purely Indian” cities (not built by foreigners). Very dirty, however.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-india-125203_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Jojpur</b> is a city no less attractive from an architectural point of view than Ahmedabad. And no less dirty. There is also a huge photogenic castle on a hill.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-india-126895_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Pushkar</b> is a half-day town around the lake, where for some reason hippies like to hang out. Meat and alcohol are completely prohibited.
<b>Jaipur</b> - cool forts and palaces, mediocre city, albeit with pink buildings.

<b>Results</b>
In general, India is a fairly cheap country, not least because there is nowhere to spend money - neither on food nor on entertainment. For two people it usually works out to about $30 a day, alone I easily managed $20 even with huge travel. In Goa and Mumbai it was more expensive due to expensive housing.

Should I go there again? In 10 years, maybe something will change. For now, I’d rather go to China, everything changes there every year.
