Sit back, this is going to be my longest review yet. A large country - a detailed analysis. I spent three months in India and was essentially everywhere except the northeastern states and islands.

<b>Money</b>
Indian currency is called rupee. $1 = 65 rupees.
You can withdraw a maximum of 10,000 rupees at a time (about $150) from an ATM. Most ATMs charge a fee of Rs 200, but at least State Bank of India and Yes! Bank have no commission. I almost always used the State Bank because they usually give out 500 bills, which is much better than 2000 bills.
In 2016, an expropriation reform took place: 500 and 1000 rupees bills were taken out of circulation without warning, just like in the USSR in 1991. You could deposit money into a bank account or exchange it in cash, but no more than ~5000 per day. The government naively hoped that underground millionaires and drug lords would go to repent and beg for forgiveness, but it is unlikely that they kept suitcases of rupees at home, instead of dollars or bitcoins. The smartest hired beggars for 10 rupees to stand in lines at banks and exchange 5,000 each. In the end, everyone got into trouble because India is not Switzerland, here cards are accepted pretty much nowhere. Instead of cards, however, there is a payment system Pay TM, it is linked to the phone, and through it you can pay in many shops, restaurants and even stalls. This system is of no use to foreigners, because you cannot top up your Pay TM account with a foreign credit card, so you can only deposit in cash. Foreign credit cards are accepted only at McDonald's and Marriott.
Simultaneously with the withdrawal of 500 and 1000, a new 2000 bill was introduced. Can you imagine what will happen if you have 50, 100 bills, and then only 2000, and ATMs give out 2000? That's right, it will be very difficult to exchange it. At the beginning of 2017, a new type of 500 banknotes was introduced, with them it became easier to change bills, since a typical bill in a restaurant will be at least 200-300. 2000 is still accepted reluctantly; for some reason hotels always have no change for it. The best place to exchange them is at Burger King.
On the other hand, little notes are also always missing. Notes of 10 rupees are popular, and most prices are rounded to 10, and coins of 1-2-5 rupees are not enough. In stores they may give you candy and chewing gum for change; on buses they may round up to 5 or 10.


<b>Language</b>
The language of international communication in India is English, more or less educated people know it, less educated people at least know numbers. There are not many people who are completely uneducated if you travel around large or touristy cities.
Hindi is popular in the northern half of the country. If you listen to Hindi, for example, watch a movie with subtitles, you will notice that they often insert words and even entire phrases in English into Hindi. I only learned the alphabet from Hindi (called “Devanagari”), more or less so that I could read the signs on the buses. Buses are essentially the only place where there may not be signs in English. Menus in restaurants are in English 99% of the time (only a couple of times in the slums I saw them in Hindi/Marathi), signs are in English, inscriptions on goods in stores are in English.
In addition to Hindi, in the northern half of the country there are other languages of the Indo-Aryan group: Punjabi, Marathi (in Mumbai), Bengali (in Kolkata), Odia (in Orissa). The letters are slightly different, but similar to those in Hindi (except for the Odia alphabet).
In the southern part of the country, the languages Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam are not at all similar to Hindi, they are from a completely different group, and their letters are also completely different, I couldn’t master these - there are too many of them.
In the state of Goa, the Konkani language is written in the Latin alphabet.


<b>Transport</b>
It is wise to use airplanes to travel long distances; in India there are low-cost airlines whose prices are comparable to 2-3 class trains for long journeys.
Now about the main thing: trains. The advantages of trains are obvious: they are more comfortable than buses, the stations are usually in the city center, the schedule is on the Internet, you can sleep comfortably in them at night, with their help you can visit neighboring cities one by one (planes do not always fly directly between neighboring cities, there may be a transfer in hub). The disadvantages in India are lack of punctuality and some difficulties in purchasing tickets.
I'll start with (im)punctuality. This is the problem. I have traveled by train more than 20 times, and never (!) has a train deviated from the schedule by less than half an hour. Once it arrived on time (Goa-Mumbai), but departed about 45 minutes late. Once it arrived half an hour earlier (Chennai-Bangalore), arriving at 4-30 am instead of 5. Most trains are late by at least an hour, the biggest delay was 5 hours (Agra-Khajuraho). This means you can't plan any transfers unless you don't mind losing your ticket. If you board not at the initial station, but at an intermediate one, you can safely add an hour to the departure time. But what if it does arrive on time? For this there is a magical website <a href="https://enquiry.indianrail.gov.in/mntes/">https://enquiry.indianrail.gov.in/mntes/</a>, where you can track your train in real time. A really indispensable thing, because they also indicate the platform where it arrives, and announcements at the station may be illegible or absent altogether. This site is also useful if you are already on the train and want to know when to get off. No one announces stops on the train, and the conductor, unlike Russia, will not wake you up at 5 am before your station. There are no conductors there at all, or rather there is one per ten cars, who checks tickets once and is never seen again.
<i>The site so touchingly promises that after a while the train will catch up with the schedule, although in reality it will only be more late</i>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946303694_08b78245f4_o.png" title=""/>
All of the above applies to trains with reserved seats. There are other trains with only general cars; you won’t find them on the ticket booking website (after all, you don’t need to book a ticket for them in advance), only on the website with timetables. I have never ridden one of these, because they mostly travel short distances, and only occasionally between different regions. Such trains have even worse schedule compliance.
Now about the tickets. There are many different classes on Indian trains, in practice you may encounter the following:
1AC - first class with air conditioning. I have never ridden in one of these, there are very few of them. In terms of configuration, this is an analogue of a Russian coupe (compartment for four with doors)
2AC - second class with air conditioning. I rode in it once. In terms of configuration - like a Russian platskart (3rd class). Four seats in the compartment + two on the side.
3AC - third class with air conditioning. I've ridden it several times, there are quite a lot of them and the price is low. There are three tiers in the compartment, two on the side bunks.
<i>Car 3AC</i>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945966056_90bb575f73_o.jpg" title=""/>
SL - "sleeper", without air conditioning. The configuration is similar to 3AC, with fans hanging on the ceiling. They are the most common car and form the bulk of the train on most trains, although there are trains consisting entirely of 3ACs. I always tried to take the top shelves, they are the most convenient: you can immediately climb up there, and no one will bother you. The lower one will have to be shared with neighbors, and the middle one is the worst: it is lowered only at night, because otherwise you cannot sit on the lower one.
2S is a seated carriage without air conditioning. This class is found on daytime trains that run between neighboring regions. In appearance, it can be either an train with benches or an SL class car. The seats are fixed, so there should be no crowding. If you get into a sleeper, then there is a chance to climb onto the third shelf - consider yourself winning the jackpot, you can stretch out and ride lying down.
CC/EC - seated carriages with air conditioning. They are rare. EC is the most elite, the price will be more expensive than even 2A.
There is also “General Class”, usually the first and/or last car in the train. Seats are not reserved there; you can buy tickets just before departure, if you manage to squeeze in, of course. In fact, on some trains there is no crowding, and then the General may not be so bad, but it is better to take at least a sleeper, since it still costs very little.
If you are not very squeamish, then the trains are quite comfortable. Yes, the toilets are a bit cramped, like in the old Russian trains. Yes, it can get a little hot during the day without air conditioning. But stretching out on the shelf is quite nice. By the way, even in sleeper and 2S cars there are sockets in each compartment, you can sit with a laptop. There is no crushing, shoving with elbows, no storming of carriages (except General, but it can be avoided).
<i>A special case - a seated carriage on the Shimla-Kalka mountain narrow gauge railway</i>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946228423_5c30e41dd1_o.jpg" title=""/>
These are the approximate prices. 2S: 1 km = 0.5 rupees. SL: 1 km = 0.7-1 rupees. The shorter the distance, the more expensive per kilometer. 3AC is two to three times more expensive than a sleeper, 2AC is 30 percent more expensive than 3AC, 1AC is very expensive, almost twice as expensive as 2AC. For clarity, if Moscow and St. Petersburg were in India (mind me!), then the ticket would cost approximately this:
- in a seated carriage 300 rubles / $5
- in a sleeper 450 rubles / $7.5
- at 3AC 1200 rubles / $20
- in 2AC 1600 rubles / $27
- in 1AC 3000 rubles / $50
- in reality, a sleeper in Russia costs from 1000 to 2000 rubles
- coupe from 2500 to 5000 rubles
And in India, the train from Moscow to St. Petersburg would not take 7-8 hours, but 12-14, plus a delay.

The main problem of Indian railways, oddly enough, is that there are few trains. Yes, the overall numbers are quite large, but don’t forget about the population! Here, for example, are tickets from Bangalore to Hyderabad, two neighboring large cities at a distance of about 400 kilometers:
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946303714_51b3a6181a_o.png" title=""/>
Only 7 trains per day! Of these, only two are direct, the rest are passing by. Two, for example, go all the way to Delhi. The first of the trains, by the way, covers 400 kilometers in almost 20 hours. And this is between cities the size of Moscow and St. Petersburg! In China, trains would run every half hour (and the travel time would be two hours). So it's no surprise that train tickets are selling out and purchasing them before departure can be difficult. Now let's figure out how.
You can, of course, buy a ticket at the station at the ticket office, but this is a gesture of despair. There are queues there, and Indians don’t know how to stand in queues, someone is always pushing ahead, you’ll have to jostle your elbows at the window. Besides, this is India, you can’t say: “One ticket to Mumbai tomorrow at 20:15, sleeper class.” First you need to push your way to the window and take a special form there; without it they won’t talk to you. In the application you need to write the train number, your name and age (although you still need to give a passport), home address, telephone number, mother's maiden name and the name of your favorite pet. If you don’t fill it in, they may send you to finish it. And only then do you have to push your way to the cash register with this piece of paper. This may take a couple of hours. In general, you need to buy tickets online.
First, you need to register on the official website <a href="https://www.irctc.co.in/eticketing/loginHome.jsf">irctc.co.in</a>: tickets are sold only there, on other sites you will still need to log in to this site at the end. It's not difficult, but you need to verify your email and mobile phone, and only Indian phones are accepted. If you don’t have it, you can send a scan of your passport to support; my account was approved about a week later. If you have a SIM card, then everything is done instantly.
The interface of the official website is terrible. Besides the grammatical errors and googly-eyed design, there are a couple of major functionality issues. Firstly, there may be several train stations in one city, and you cannot simply search for tickets from Delhi, you need to enter a specific station, and they are not even divided by train directions. Secondly, you are shown a list of trains in the selected direction, on the right in the last column is a list of classes that are on this train. You need to click on a specific class, then the page will reload and you will be shown whether there are tickets available and how many. If there are a lot of trains, it will take a long time to click. The way out of this is simple: you need to look for tickets on the website makemytrip.com, there is a good interface, you can display a grid by dates and by classes, you can immediately see how many tickets are available, and you can search for the whole city. And you can already buy on irctc, knowing which train you need. However, there may also be problems with this: the interface that accepts foreign credit cards for payment periodically glitches, especially in the morning, when tatkal tickets are posted (see below). If it was glitchy, I bought through cleartrip.com. This site does not have a very user-friendly interface, but the commission is lower than on makemytrip - only 20-40 rupees for the entire booking, plus less than 2% for paying by credit card. On the official website there is a 4% commission for paying with a foreign credit card, so if your ticket is expensive, it may be even cheaper through cleartrip.
From one account you can buy only six tickets per month, or rather six reservations: the purchase of seats on one train for several people is considered one reservation.
With an electronic ticket you can board the train and show the ticket to the ticket inspector on your phone screen.
If there are tickets, you will see the status AVL = available on the website. If there is still a month before departure, then most likely it will be so, and you will happily buy a ticket. While in Malaysia, I bought several tickets well in advance without any problems.
If there is less than a week left before departure, then most likely the status will be WL = wait list, which means that there are no tickets. Cunning Indians have come up with a whole system for this situation. In Russia, if there are no tickets, then all you have to do is press F5 in the hope that someone will refund their ticket. But in Russia there is no such competition for tickets, unless we are talking about holidays. In India, you can get on the waiting list, and if someone returns a ticket, it will automatically go to you. More precisely, everything is a bit more complex. First, the status of tickets is AVL, let's say there are 500 such tickets. When they run out, tickets with the status RAC = reservation against cancellation begin to be sold. For example, admins know that on average 20% of tickets are cancelled, so 100 RAC tickets are sold. If you have an RAC ticket, you will be allowed on the train and must find a seat, but you aren't guaranteed to have a whole see, there may be one for two people. So if you are traveling together and are not afraid to sleep in one bed, then you can safely take the RAC. In practice, RAC almost always turns into a full-fledged seat, because seats are freed up not only due to the tickets returned, there are also special quotas for all sorts of military personnel and officials, that also disappear the day before departure and go to the holders of RAC tickets.
If the RAC tickets are over, WL begins. You pay and get in line and hope that a lot of people will cancel their tickets and your status will turn into at least RAC. If it doesn’t work out, the money will be returned to you (theoretically, you can even buy a WL ticket for cash, but then you also have to refund it in cash and in a short time, and it will be returned to the card automatically). It's a lottery and I don't think it's worth playing unless it's your last chance. What if tickets don't appear? You still have to go, which means you should have already had a plan B (for example, a ticket for another date), one of your plans will fall through, and you won’t be able to get a full refund for the tickets right before departure. So read on.
All trains have a special quota called "tatkal". These tickets go on sale the day before departure at exactly 10 am (sleeper and 2S) and 11 am (3AC, 2AC, 1AC) and cost 100-200 rupees more than usual. The cleartrip website does not work until 11:30, you can only buy a ticket on the official one, and foreign credit cards simply did not work for me at that time. The only time I tried to buy a ticket this way, all 300 tatkal tickets disappeared from sale in about 2 minutes, so there’s really no point in hoping for tatkal tickets, although once I did buy a ticket for a less popular train using this quota.
There is another lifesaver called the “tourist quota”. Yes, you, as a foreigner, are privileged on the railway almost like a Brahmin official! The pitfall is that with this quota you cannot buy a ticket on the Internet, only in person. And not everywhere, but only at special ticket offices, which are only available in some of the largest cities. I've been in two of these. In Kolkata, it’s not at the station at all, but in the city center, I sat there for two hours, because Bangladeshis are also considered tourists and buy tickets at this ticket office. But there they call you by number, you don’t have to jostle. In Bangalore, this ticket office is on par with the regular ones; all sorts of people try to go there and buy tickets. I haven’t found a complete official list of foreigner registers; it’s easy to google posts on forums with partial lists. Another pitfall is that only a small proportion of trains have quota for tourists. Which ones, however, can still be seen on the Internet, on the third official website: <a href="https://indiarailinfo.com">https://indiarailinfo.com</a>. You need to install a plugin for Chrome, otherwise the number of available places will not be loaded.
What to do if nothing helps? Here I see several options:
- Look for another date/time if your schedule is tight. If you travel less than 400-500 kilometers, there are often daytime seated class 2S trains, in which tickets are usually available even the day before departure
- Go to General class
- Buy a General class ticket and try to negotiate with the conductor so that for an additional fee he can transfer you to a sleeper for at least part of the journey
- Go by bus

Buses are local transport. They travel within one state or to a neighboring one. Buses are divided into two types: public and private. State-owned companies are called [name of state] State Road Transport Corporation (SRTC), these companies often have websites where you can view schedules, sometimes even buy tickets online. All these buses are without air conditioning, quite old, cramped, but with open windows. There is no smoking inside, so you can go. Some passengers travel standing, so it is better to take care not to be one of them. On popular routes, buses usually run at least once every half hour, or even more often, so traveling 100-200 kilometers is not a problem.
It’s not clear with private buses. If you enter bus from [Indian city 1] to [Indian city 2] into Google, the first link will usually be the site redbus.in, where some kind of schedule is even indicated, but all these buses, which supposedly should have air conditioning and even sleeping bunks, depart not from bus stations, but from where it is unclear. Apparently, from the company's office somewhere in the city. In Amritsar, near my hotel, there were just a few such offices, and in the evening there were also buses that looked more decent than government ones. I haven’t seen them anywhere in other cities, so it’s unclear how to use this type of transport. Unless you buy a ticket through a travel agency, which is sometimes found even in non-tourist cities, but then you will probably overpay significantly, given that these buses are already more expensive than even class 3A trains.
The quality of roads in India is variable. The main routes between cities are in good condition, but as soon as the bus enters any city, all hell breaks loose. It’s especially visible after rain, then it’s reminiscent of apocalyptic pictures of Russian roads.
The average bus speed is higher than in Indonesia. I would estimate it at 40 kilometers per hour, although on a bad road like Nashik-Vapi it could be 20.

<b>Local transport</b>
As of August 2017, India has eight metros in the following cities: Delhi, Gurgaon, Kolkata, Jaipur, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Cochin. I've ridden all of them. Their usefulness varies. Delhi has the largest network of lines (probably larger than all the others combined), you can get everywhere, incl. to the airport. The Gurgaon Metro is a ring of several stations made for show off in a wealthy suburb of Delhi. Recently it has actually connected with the yellow line of the Delhi Metro. Kolkata has one line through the central areas. In Jaipur, the line is a little short of reaching the center; two stops in the very center are being completed. In Mumbai, a metro line connects two train lines somewhere in the distant outskirts, but by metro you can get almost to the airport itself. Mumbai also has a monorail line, 80% of which goes through fields, industrial areas and a couple of slums. It seems like they want to pull it to the center, otherwise it’s somehow completely strange. In Bangalore, two lines intersecting near the station are a useful system. In Chennai, there are one and a half unfinished lines, God knows where, with trains every 20 minutes, of which not all reach the final station. In Cochin, the metro was opened a week before my arrival, it was a stump on the outskirts, but it seems they were talking about opening a second section of the line, passing through the center, in 2-3 months.
Mumbai and Chennai have a developed system of commuter trains, you can call it S-bahn, because trains run every 5-10 minutes. In these cities, this is the most convenient method of transportation. Unlike the metro, there is no security check at all on trains, and there are no turnstiles either. They never checked my tickets in Mumbai or Chennai, although I went 20 times and always bought them. Well, why not buy when they cost 5-10 rupees, it’s just inconvenient to get in line at some stations. By the way, there are first class tickets, which are 15-20 times more expensive than regular ones. The first class carriage is no different from the second, except for the sign at the entrance, but there are much fewer people there. For locals there are special savings cards that can be used to pay for tickets at the machine. Sometimes a cashier sits near the machine and sells tickets for cash, debiting from his card.

Buses run in most cities. In the more decent ones (Delhi, Chandigarh, Tiruchirappalli, Hyderabad) they have numbers, and the routes are sometimes even marked on Google maps, although the regularity is unpredictable. In worse cities (Cochin, Calcutta), all or some of the buses do not have numbers, only the direction is indicated on the windshield. In Kolkata, I traveled by simply taking a bus going in the right direction and getting off if it turned off. In the poorest cities (Agra, Varanasi, etc.) there are no buses at all, instead there are pick-up minibuses or collective tuk-tuks. In this case, it is almost impossible to avoid a taxi.

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945966036_14150a2f70_o.jpg" title=""/>
Taxis in India are in 90% of cases tuk-tuks, which are called “rickshaws” or “autos” here. Pedicabs are found in small towns and only in the northern half of the country. In Calcutta there are also pedestrian rickshaws, I don't know why: the pedicabs cost the same, but they still go faster than a pedestrian. In Kolkata and central Mumbai there are black and yellow taxis instead of tuk-tuks, but further away from central Mumbai there are the same tuk-tuks.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945066192_c20718aff1_o.jpg" title=""/>
In theory, there are taxi cars, but they are only for the rich, so they don’t just pick up passengers on the street. If you live in a five-star hotel, they will call you.
In theory, tuk-tuks have meters, at least in the main cities, but I only managed to ride with a meter once, in Mumbai. According to the meter, it should be approximately 10-12 rupees per kilometer, in fact you will have to pay one and a half to two times more, at least. The impudence of tuk-tukers varies from place to place. In Delhi they seem to be the most accommodating, I easily negotiated for 1.5x meter fare. In Chennai they wanted three times as much, so I traveled by buses and trains. In tourist places everything is usually bad in this regard.
There is also such a thing as Uber. This app works in major cities, the price is about the same as what you can negotiate with a tuk-tuk after haggling, but Uber has decent cars with air conditioning. Uber is especially useful if you need to travel a long distance (10 kilometers), then it will definitely be cheaper than a tuk-tuk.
There is also an Indian alternative to Uber - the Ola Cabs app. I tried to use it, but it didn't work. Theoretically, you can call a tuk-tuk through it, but when I did this, the tuk-tuk did not come to me both times (although the order is immediately marked as accepted in the application). By car, Ola Cabs turns out to be more expensive than Uber.

<b>Accomodation</b>
In India, like in China, there is a law that requires a hotel to have a special license to serve foreigners. Unlike China, in India this law is observed very strictly, and you will never get into the cheapest housing for locals. However, the number of hotels with a license and their prices vary greatly. Let's say, in Bangalore and Hyderabad I was accommodated in hotels near the station without any problems, but in Ahmedabad they refused me in all but the most expensive one with rooms starting from 1000 rupees. The next day, however, I stayed in another area for 500. It was much worse in Shimla and Kolkata: in the first I had to pay more than 1000, in the second - 1500 (the most expensive accommodation of the entire trip), although in Kolkata maybe the problem was that I arrived in the evening, and all the cheap rooms were occupied. Yes, if the hotel does not have a license, they will tell you that there are no rooms: “Full”.
Interesting features of check-in: often, especially near train stations, rooms are rented out for exactly 24 hours from the moment of check-in. On the one hand, if you arrive by bus in the evening, this is convenient: then you don’t have to check out until the evening. On the other hand, if you arrive by night train at 5 am, then you have to get up at 5 am to check out. And in the city of Puri there is an enchanting feature: in all hotels, check-out is at 8 am! Simply because.
On average, a double room with air conditioning costs 800 rupees, a single room without air conditioning - 400-500, if you look hard enough, then 350. In some relatively small tourist cities there may be an excess supply, so you can find it cheaper, for example, in Jodhpur I only lived for 180 rupees in a quite good room.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946303704_e07844e399_o.jpg" title=""/>
The quality of hotels does not always correlate with price. For example, in the city of Gaya, for 800 rupees, we stayed in a room with air conditioning, which was terrible: gloomy, dirty, shabby. The next day we moved to a hotel exactly opposite for the same price, but with clean and comfortable rooms, also with air conditioning.
There is almost no hot water anywhere, boilers are a rarity. Sometimes there seems to be hot water, but only from the tap (not from the shower), you need to stir it in a bucket, just like in Indonesia. Wi-fi is also not always available.


Ooh, we have a problem. In LiveJournal the maximum size of a post is 64 kilobytes of text, but here it turned out to be almost 90. Therefore, I had to split the text into two parts. To be continued.


This is the second part of the review of India, which I had to split in two due to restrictions on the length of the post in LiveJournal. It will be about food, the Internet, attractions, general impressions and financial results.

<b>Food</b>
This is my main disappointment in India. I thought it would be very good, like in China or Thailand, but it turned out to be very mediocre.
Indian cuisine is very monotonous. It seems that India is big, there are many different peoples and languages, but in reality their food is no different, no comparison with China, where the cuisine of different provinces is noticeably different. A restaurant may sometimes even be called “Punjabi” or “Hyderabadi”, but the menu will be the same everywhere; I can list all 40-50 Indian dishes with my eyes closed. It’s funny that in the north the menu will have a “South Indian” section (that’s right, not Karnataka/Kerala/Tamilnadu, but all of southern India), which usually contains dosa flatbreads, but in southern India they will be along with everything for the rest, that's all the difference. Here's a typical menu.

This restaurant is located in Mumbai in the middle of the Dharavi slum, so the prices are slightly below average. The maximum number of dishes is presented here: about 20 chicken dishes, the same number from lamb (Mutton), and another 20 vegetarian ones, many of them differing only by replacing chicken with lamb or with cheese (Paneer) in the vegetarian version. A separate item is "tandoori" - grilled chicken, and "biryani" - a rice dish reminiscent of spicy pilaf. On the second page there are “Chinese” dishes, which barely resemble real Chinese dishes, but are quite good, I especially quote Chicken Machurian and Hakka noodles. There is still a missing section for “thali” - this is a combo lunch of small portions of several dishes.

Pork and beef are almost impossible to find in restaurants, although the meat itself is sold in the respective ethnic areas. Beef, by the way, is not prohibited in itself; it is forbidden to kill cows, but only in some states in the north and west. In the central and southern states, you can kill bulls, but not cows. In Kerala and the northeastern states, anything is possible.
In coastal cities, fish and shrimp appear on the menu. They don't exist in cities in the interior of the country.
There are several problems with food. Firstly, there are few restaurants. Very few. Here's an example: the road from my hotel in Mumbai to the Chinese n' Grill restaurant (by the way, a decent place, prices are slightly higher than average, but worth it). 800 meters is not 10 minutes, but rather 15, because you need to squeeze through the crowd and dodge motorcycles, and there is simply nothing closer (there is only one, but it is vegetarian). This is the very center of Mumbai; in less dense cities, it happened that I spent an hour looking for somewhere to eat.

Secondly, a significant portion of restaurants are vegetarian, and the bigger the hole you are in, the more significant this portion is. For example, in Goa almost every establishment has meat, but in the small town of Vapi in the center I found only one establishment where I could eat something other than vegetables (although there were only three vegetarian ones there too). Vegetarian food is mostly tasteless and triple monotonous, because there will be only 20 dishes. And if you think that vegetarian food is salads of fresh cucumbers with tomatoes and lettuce, then I will disappoint you. In India, vegetarian dishes consist mainly of all sorts of beans, peas and other things that are somehow not very pleasant to eat in large quantities. Even potatoes are not always available. And eggs, by the way, are not included in the vegetarian diet, although it cannot be called vegan in the Western sense of the word, because there is milk and cheese. In general, in the first month I devoured vegetarian thali, but by the end of the third, just the word “vegetarianism” makes me shake.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945965891_6de4ef0a2b_o.jpg" title=""/>
Thirdly, the food is not always tasty. In Thailand and China, I have never come across a place where the food was bad and tasteless. India is full of places at the level of Soviet canteens. As a rule, all establishments in the lower price range are terrible, despite the fact that the difference between the “lower” and the “middle” in price is small. For example, a vegetarian thali in the cheapest establishment can be found for 50-60 rupees ($1), and on average it will cost about 120 ($2), but for 50 your thali will have two or three dishes instead of six, they will not be tasty and heavily diluted with water, the contents will generally be about zero, like one piece of potato floating in the sauce. They will just give you the same amount of rice as for 120.
An example of lunch from the lowest price range: this establishment doesn’t even have a menu, only this one option to eat costs 60 rupees. Only good for filling your belly with rice and a minimum amount of vegetables. People not accustomed to spicy food, would also call it too spicy. By the way, this is supposed to be eaten with your hands, although eating rice with your hands is, to put it mildly, inconvenient. It's good that I had a spoon with me.

Towards the end, I was so fed up with all these sauces and the long search for restaurants that I began to constantly go to McDonald's and Burger King whenever possible. In general, these establishments in India are more expensive than their Russian counterparts. Indian McDonald's is pretty bad. There is no beef, instead only chicken or vegetarian substitutes. Chicken cutlets are tasteless. An analogue of the Big Mac is called “Maharaja Mac”, it costs about 3 dollars (in Russia a Big Mac costs $2, in Malaysia $2.5 with almost free potatoes and cola), and there are so many hot peppers that even I couldn’t eat, I had to pick out all the pepper from the burger, which has never happened to me in my life before. At McDonald's, I usually got the cheapest Mac Egg burger, which costs about 30 rupees (the sign says 25, but there is about 20% tax added). Burger King is cheaper than McDo and much tastier, closer to its counterparts in other countries in terms of taste. The maximum combo with a chicken Whopper costs 258 rupees (combo with Maharaja Mac is 310), there is also a Whopper with mutton for 30 rupees more. For 164 rupees you can get a maximum combo with a small chicken burger. Unfortunately, Burger King network is much smaller than McDonald's. KFC in India is expensive and very tasteless - nothing like the classic KFC taste, just very spicy chicken.

A few words about cleanliness and poisoning. I was seriously poisoned twice in 82 days: the first time I even had to spend one day in bed, the second time I only drank charcoal and phthalazole tablets. I don’t think it’s about the food: Alena and I always ate together, and we had poisonings on different days. Rather, the problem is my lack of the habit of obsessively washing my hands: I wash them only in the toilet and before eating in a restaurant (and then only if there is a washbasin), and, say, if I want to eat a couple of cookies on the go, then I never bother. In a normal country, this is enough, touching the door handle or the handrail of an escalator will not get you dirty. In India, as you can see, once a month you can get poisoned.

Now about food in stores. This is all very, very bad. It’s clear that there won’t be large supermarkets in any Cambodian village, but it’s somehow strange when in a city with a population of 10 million there are only five. In St. Petersburg, within a five-minute walk from my house, there were five supermarkets, in each of which, despite the small area of sales floors (two or three rooms), the choice of goods was several times greater than in Indian “hypermarkets”, reminiscent of Soviet stores from photographs from 1991, where long shelves are stacked in a single layer of the same product. The only supermarket with a normal selection of goods by our standards is the German chain Spar, which is present in only 7 cities. In particular, in Delhi there are only 4 of them per 20 million population, in Chennai - one per 7 million. Can you imagine that in Moscow there will be four stores for the entire city, and all the rest of the shopping will be only in stalls near the metro? Welcome to India!
For snacks, I constantly bought Limca soda (35-40 rupees for 600 ml), peanuts (5-10 rupees), several types of cookies (20-30 rupees), chips (10-20 rupees for a small pack). Instant noodles in India are called Maggi, cost 12 rupees, and only one brand is more or less common. Having a couple of bags in your stash is a good idea because if you arrive in a new city after 9-10 pm, everything will be closed and you won’t be able to find other food.
The price is indicated on the packaging of all factory goods, but at small points it can be rounded to the nearest ten due to the eternal lack of change.
Fruits aren't plentiful either. There are no exotic ones. There are apples that cost three times more than in Russia (from 150 rupees per kilo); small sour tasteless mangoes; good pomegranates (80-100 rupees per kilo), which I mostly ate; bananas (3-5 rupees each).

<b>Internet</b>
In India, Wi-Fi is ONLY with a passport. You can check into a hotel only with your passport, so they will simply give you a password there, as usual. At airports, train stations, and McDonald's, you will definitely need to enter an SMS password, and for this, most likely, you need a local SIM card (although foreign numbers work at Delhi airport).
To buy a SIM card, you need to have a 3 by 4 photo with you and fill out a form. At first, the SIM card doesn’t even see the network, after a while (up to a day) it will connect, but for the Internet to work, you need to call a special short number and answer the questions of the robot, which will ask for your date of birth and the last digits of your passport number. Something was wrong with one of my SIM cards, I had to switch to a live operator, but in the end everything worked. I doubt that in a remote province they know how to properly sell SIM cards to foreigners, so it’s better to solve this issue in Delhi/Mumbai, but not at the airport, because at the airport the price is stupidly inflated five times (I was told 1 gigabyte for 1200 rupees, although it costs 179 + the SIM card).
The SIM card itself costs 50-100 rupees. There are just a lot of tariffs, there are also 6-7 operators, some of them are in the process of merging. Previously, each operator worked only in part of the states, and it turned out that in each specific state there were 3-4 operators out of 6, and always different. Now everything seems to be simplified; the main operators have de facto canceled roaming within the country. I used two SIM cards from major operators: Airtel (the most popular) and Vodafone (either the second or the third). The Internet worked in all regions at the same home region rates (as far as I know, only in Kashmir it will not work). My home region was Delhi because that's where I bought these cards. In theory, prices are higher in Delhi, so if you buy in Agra, which is in the poorest state of Uttar Pradesh, it should be a little cheaper. But in general, Internet tariffs are quite cheap. From Airtel I bought 1 gigabyte for 28 days for 179 rupees. I recommend this operator. Vodafone is worse - the network is worse, more expensive (1 gigabyte is more than 250 rupees), there is also a strange division into 3G and 4G, on some tariffs half of the traffic is only 4G, if your phone does not support it, you will not have this half.
You can top up your account at any stall that displays logos of mobile operators or sells phones. If you put 100 rupees, a little more than 80 comes into your account due to tax (on July 1, 2017, India underwent a large-scale tax reform, a single sales tax was introduced instead of many old taxes such as VAT, because of this everything has become a little more expensive).

<b>General impressions</b>
There are a lot of negative reviews about India like “How shocking the piles of garbage on the streets are,” probably because people have never been to such places before, and in contrast to Europe, India looks shocking. On the contrary, in the first days I was surprised at what an ordinary country it was. Well, the streets in Myanmar are dirtier, the slums in the Philippines are shabbier, not to mention Haiti. There is so little unusual color in India, only cows walk the streets, and it is very difficult to find anything else original, not like in Yangon. I would compare traveling around India with traveling through small provincial industrial half-abandoned cities of Russia with a population of 10-20 thousand people: the beauty of the city landscapes and the range of entertainment are approximately at the same level.

But India ultimately taught me something. You can go to Sweden or France to see how to properly arrange your life to make it comfortable and cozy. And India is Sweden in reverse, a complete collection of examples of how not to live. You may object: “So it’s the same in Bangladesh!” To this I will answer that, firstly, it’s not exactly the same, and secondly, there is little demand from Bangladesh, East Timor, Haiti and other assholes of the world: these are small countries without useful resources at the end of the world, and India is kind of like the second country in the world in terms of population and strenuously laying claim to the status of one of the world powers, this is a different weight category.
Let's briefly summarize the main points.
E - efficiency. Anyone who works in the IT field has heard many jokes about Indian programmers. I dare to assure you that this is all for a reason. The organization of business processes here is excellent. Trains are hours late, long questionnaires with meaningless questions are held in high esteem, for fun they build a subway in an industrial zone, they put operators in front of automatic machines, you can list all the absurdity for a long time.
C - comfort. Indians have a very small comfort zone, even smaller than Russians and Americans. For an Indian, everything beyond the threshold of the house is not just foreign, but almost enemy, where you can throw garbage and piss on the walls. Even richer people do not consider it shameful to throw a candy wrapper out the window of a train or car. For the same reason, the cultural heritage is in a terrible state: if it is not a monument of national importance, which is surrounded by a fence and paid entrance, then they do not restore anything, they do not try to preserve its beauty.
P - performance. While in Indonesia the working day begins at almost six in the morning, in India even McDonald's opens at 10-11. Everything closes early too, after 9 the cities die out. There are twice as many parasite guards and paper stampers than even in Russia. The speed of work in India is also fantastic: only here they managed to prepare an order of scrambled eggs and chopped tomatoes in an empty restaurant for more than 40 minutes.

P - paranoia. In India, officials and rulers see terrorists under every plinth. Apart from the standard Pakistanis who want to take over the state of Kashmir, there are all sorts of other marginal groups. Indira Gandhi was killed by the Sikhs, Rajiv Gandhi a few years later by the Tamil freedom fighters of Sri Lanka. The further into the forest, the greater the paranoia; since the 1990s, journalism in the country has been virtually banned, even the activities of the government are covered very sparingly. Being a journalist in India is like being gay in Russia. Camera phobia is flourishing, which sometimes takes on simply absurd proportions; for example, it may be prohibited to take photographs in an ordinary city park. And yes, in India they can also imprison you for likes and reposts.
D - depression. Above, I compared India with a remote Russian province. What do we do for fun in these places? Vodka. In India, by the way, this problem is also very acute, drunken husbands also beat their wives en masse (and sometimes pour acid on them, because in India acid is sold everywhere as a cleaning agent). Entertainment such as taking a walk in the park, going to a restaurant, hanging out in a club or going to the theater in India, if available in the largest cities, is in absolutely negligible quantities. The life of the vast majority of people is hopeless and consists of the church and substances: khat for the poorest (half of the food stalls sell only khat) and alcohol for the slightly richer people. India is a country where people do not smile; I have never seen such a concentration of gloomy, gloomy faces anywhere else.

You will say: “Shanti! All this can be tolerated.” Of course, I lived there for three months, and I didn’t even stop enjoying visiting beautiful places, which will be discussed in the next section. But in order to endure all these shortcomings, there must be something to endure for, right? In Indian cities, you don't want to stay a minute longer than you need to see the main attractions. There are only two places I am ready to come again without stretching: Mumbai and Goa, although they also lose competition with Bangkok or Kuala Lumpur.


<b>Attractions</b>
<b>Delhi</b> is the capital, an unattractive city, in which, however, many monuments from different eras remain. Convenient to travel by metro.
<b>Amritsar</b> is the only place in India where there is a pedestrian tourist street, like in Europe. Apart from it and the Sikh temple there is not much else to see. You can go to the Pakistani border for a show.
<b>Dharamsala</b> is a village in the mountains where the Dalai Lama lives in exile. It's nice to spend a couple of days in a cool climate.
<b>Shimla</b> is a city with beautiful panoramic views, but not so pleasant up close. Expensive housing. Here is one of the old narrow-gauge mountain railways, an alternative to Darjeeling.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945965721_8c125c9a88_o.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Chandigarh</b> is a typical Soviet city with wide avenues and commercial blocks.
<b>Agra</b> - Taj Mahal, many slums. The curious town of Fatehpur Sikri is about 30 kilometers to the west.
<b>Khajuraho</b> is a very colorful village with famous temples decorated with erotic sculptures. Good place.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946228158_fe72c96434_o.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Varanasi</b> is the ugliest hole where they try to sell hard drugs on every corner.
<b>Gaya</b> - there, nearby, Buddha reached enlightenment. You can look at Buddhist temples in the style of different countries.
<b>Puri</b> is a city with a poor beach. It’s difficult to call it a resort, more like a hole by the sea.
<b>Kolkata</b> is one of the most interesting cities in India. Built by the British, so it looks like a city, not a large village. Lots of colonial architecture. There's a lot of old-world stuff, like people with typewriters on the streets. Lots of screaming poverty.
<b>Cochin</b> is a nice city with remnants of colonial heritage.
<b>Goa</b> is the most pleasant place in India. A huge amount of Portuguese architecture throughout the state, Old Goa with churches, forts, green hills. Quite clean. Lots of restaurants with good food. Comfortable hotels (more expensive than in the rest of India, though). As a beach resort - at the level of Crimea with the same density of people.

<b>Mumbai</b> is a cool city. Pretentious colonial architecture, but in much better condition than in Calcutta. Civilized looking center. The only place in India with world class shopping experience. Famous slums.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945066082_32a2fd0048_o.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Thiruvananthapuram</b> is a medium-sized village.
<b>Kanyakumari</b> is the southernmost point of India. It looks like a resort in Abkhazia that was abandoned about 30 years ago.
<b>Madurai</b> is supposedly the oldest city in India, but in fact there is only one large famous temple.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945065852_f9b8efc88e_o.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Tiruchrappalli</b> - I was passing through and discovered a nice temple on a huge rock.
<b>Pondicherry</b> is a French colony. There is much less left than in the Portuguese colonies, but still not bad.
<b>Chennai</b> is a big city of average lousiness. There are several interesting places.
<b>Bangalore</b> is the most civilized city, almost on a par with Mumbai. There are offices of IT companies here.
<b>Hyderabad</b> - cool Golconda fort, some Muslim architecture.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945965776_e3d9135386_o.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Aurangabad</b> - cave temples of Ellora, the tomb of Emperor Akbar, a luxurious fort in Daulatabad, a copy of the Taj Mahal. An excellent concentration of interesting places for a small town.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946303504_7bb83c93ba_o.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Daman</b> is a little-known Portuguese colony. Two forts, a lot of old architecture, and not like in Goa.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946424945_2dab45c2a1_o.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Silvassa</b> is an even lesser-known Portuguese colony near Daman. Almost nothing has survived.
<b>Ahmedabad</b> is an unexpectedly interesting city with beautiful courtyards and alleys. Probably the most beautiful of the “purely Indian” cities (not built by foreigners). Very dirty, however.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945065967_d7a0a16503_o.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Jodhpur</b> is a city no less attractive from an architectural point of view than Ahmedabad. And no less dirty. There is also a huge photogenic castle on a hill.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945065917_3fec103677_o.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Pushkar</b> is a half-day town around the lake, where for some reason hippies like to hang out. Meat and alcohol are completely prohibited.
<b>Jaipur</b> - cool forts and palaces, mediocre city, albeit with pink buildings.

<b>Results</b>
In general, India is a fairly cheap country, not least because there is nowhere to spend money - neither on food nor on entertainment. For two people it usually works out to about $30 a day, alone I easily managed $20 even with long distance travel. In Goa and Mumbai it was more expensive due to expensive housing.

Should I go there again? In 10 years, maybe something will change. For now, I’d rather go to China, everything changes there every year.
