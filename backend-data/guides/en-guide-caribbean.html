Despite all the difficulties, I finally managed to visit all the Caribbean islands. I planned the trip for a long time: I got the US visa for it back in 2019, planned for April-May 2020, of course everything was cancelled. Then there were severe Covid restrictions and few flights, which made the trip impossible. Finally, by the beginning of 2022, entry rules had become more or less acceptable in all countries, I set my sights on going there in March, and then, well, you know. My US visa expired in July, and hurricane season is already in June, so I almost jumped on the last bandwagon in May.
I've had two big trips to the Caribbean. First, in November 2016: Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, Sint Maarten, Saint Martin, Curaçao, Trinidad and Tobago, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Barbados, Haiti, Dominican Republic.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-108396_original.png" title=""/>
Second, in May 2022: Grenada, Saint Lucia, Dominica, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Sint Maarten, Jamaica.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-796943_original.png" title=""/>
Also in November 2021, I was in the Bahamas, in total I visited 19 countries in the Caribbean: all independent ones, except Cuba, and some overseas territories.

<b>General information</b>
There are so many islands in the Caribbean, and many of them are separate countries. So, let's systematize.
There are 30 countries in the Caribbean region.
Of these, 13 are independent states: Cuba, Jamaica, Bahamas, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Dominica, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados
The rest are various kinds of colonies, overseas territories and possessions of four countries.
US possessions: Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands
Dutch possessions: Sint Maarten, Saba, Sint Eustatius, Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao
French possessions: Saint-Martin, Saint-Barthélemy, Guadeloupe, Martinique
British possessions: Turks and Caicos, Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands, Anguilla, Montserrat
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-108661_original.png" title=""/>
Geographically, the following groups can be distinguished:
1. Greater Antilles: Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola (Haiti and Dominican Republic), Puerto Rico
2. Bahamas + Turks and Caicos
3. ABC Islands off the coast of South America: Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao
4. Lesser Antilles. In the English tradition they are further divided into Leeward (north of Dominica) and Windward (south of Dominica). In Russian and Spanish tradition, all these islands are called Leeward, and Windward are the ABC islands.
Also culturally and ethnographically, some territories on the mainland can be classified as the Caribbean region - everything that was not a colony of Spain. Those are Belize, part of the coast of Nicaragua and Honduras (also a colony of Britain), Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana. The ethnography here is as follows: in the Spanish colonies on the mainland the population is descendants of Indians or mestizos (a mixture of Indians and Spaniards), and in the English, Dutch and French colonies the population is descendants of slaves from Africa or migrants from other colonies (from India to Guyana, for example).

<b>Visas and passports</b>
With a Russian passport:
1. All 13 independent states are visa-free
2. You can enter the US territory with a US visa (there are no border controls when flying from the mainland)
3. You can enter the Netherlands with any valid Schengen multiple visa
4. You can enter the possessions of France ONLY with a Schengen visa issued by the French Embassy, ​​or with a special visa for these islands, which is also issued at the French Embassy. The exception is French Saint-Martin, where you can enter from the Dutch part of the island; there are no border controls there.
5. The English possessions have different policies. Turks and Caicos are visa-free. Montserrat: visa can be obtained via the Internet. Caymans: you can enter if you have a UK visa. The British Virgin Islands and Anguilla are also open if you have a US, Canadian or UK visa.
If you have a passport that does not require visas in Europe, then everything in the Caribbean is also visa-free.
The length of stay is usually 30 days.
Generally speaking, a return ticket is required everywhere, although I was often not asked for it even at check-in at the airport. Only in Saint Martin I was interrogated with passion, I even had to show cash.

Coronavirus restrictions are now a thing of the past. Back in February, when I was planning this trip, everywhere required a test for entry, and in May only a vaccination certificate was enough. I only needed the test twice - to enter Martinique and St. Kitts (plus another one in the USA, where I was in transit). Moreover, everywhere you can use antigen tests, which are done in 15 minutes (PCR on the islands takes two days). The prices are very high, of course - in Dominica I paid 60 dollars for a test, and in Antigua as much as 100 - this was generally the most expensive test during the entire pandemic, and a PCR test in Antigua would have cost all of $200.
The Caribbean is also famous for being the easiest place in the world to obtain citizenship by investment. Five countries have such programs: St. Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, St. Lucia and Grenada. The peculiarity is that you can obtain citizenship without even ever coming to your new “homeland”; you just need to pay money, wait a few months, and get a passport through the embassy. As a rule, there are two options: either simply pay an amount of about 100-200 thousand US dollars (if you take the whole family, then the additional payment is not very large, for example, in St. Kitts 150k for one or 195k for a family), or buy real estate from 300-400 thousand dollars. Theoreticall, the property can then be sold after at least 5 years, but I doubt there will be many people willing to buy it. In addition, when buying real estate, there is still a fee of about 30-40 thousand dollars, so in my opinion, if you are going to buy citizenship, then the first option is better.
Since March 2022, all these programs have been closed for citizens of Russia and Belarus.

Programs:
Saint Kitts and Nevis: http://stkitts-citizenship.com/, from $150k. The most famous and promoted country of the five.
Dominica: https://www.cbiu.gov.dm/, from $100k
Antigua and Barbuda: https://cip.gov.ag/, from $100k. The cheapest option (especially for a family), but you need to physically come to Antigua and Barbuda every 5 years.
Saint Lucia: https://www.cipsaintlucia.com/, from $100k. There is an option to buy interest-free bonds for $250k (in theory, it’s clearly better than real estate)
Grenada: https://cbi.gov.gd/, from $150k

The main point of these passports is to make it easier to travel and potentially get a residence permit somewhere in Europe, since it’s unlikely that many people will want to live in the Caribbean itself. They can also be used as an offshore, for example, in St. Kitts and Nevis there is no tax on personal income, but I don’t know if it’s possible to generate income from freelancing this way, or if there are any pitfalls.
In terms of travel, the main advantage is visa-free entry into the Schengen area, the UK and Ireland, as well as Singapore and South Korea. Interestingly, a visa is also not required for Russia (except for citizens of Saint Lucia).
However, you still need visas to the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and, surprisingly, even to countries such as Mexico, Thailand and Vietnam, where it is easier to get to with a Russian passport.


<b>Currency</b>
All small islands accept US dollars as payment. Local currencies are usually pegged to US dollar too.
East Caribbean dollars (St. Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada). 1 American to 2.7 Caribbean.
Barbadian dollars = 1 to 2.
Trinidadian dollars = 1 to 7.
Bahamian dollars = 1 to 1.
Netherlands Antillean florins on Sint Maarten and Curacao = 1 to 1.75.
Euro on the French islands (including French Saint Martin).
Haitian gourdes = 1 to 111 (in 2016 there were 66).
Dominican pesos = 1 to 55 (in 2016 it was 46).
Jamaican dollars = 1 to 150.

<b>How to get there</b>
The easiest way to enter this region is through the United States if you have a visa. Now a flight to America is inexpensive; I took a two-way flight from Turkey for less than $600. From the USA there are flights to almost all Caribbean countries (except for very small ones, where airports cannot accommodate large aircraft). Most flights are from Miami and New York, and from New York they are often even cheaper, although the flight is longer.
From Europe there are direct flights to some islands, usually to the former or current colonies: from Amsterdam to the Dutch one, from Paris to the French ones, from London to the British ones, but they are quite expensive. The cheapest flights are from Paris to Guadeloupe, sometimes as low as $200 one way. There are also cheap low-cost flights/charters to Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. It’s interesting that some flights fly to two islands at once; it so happened that I flew from Grenada to St. Lucia and from Antigua to St. Kitts on British Airways flights that started from London.
It is much more difficult to travel from South and Central America; flights are usually via Panama. From Colombia there are cheap flights to neighboring Dutch Aruba, from where you can fly to Saint Martin and beyond.
Cuba stands apart, since it has poor relations with the United States; Americans are prohibited from flying there as tourists, so flights are few and expensive. Because of the pandemic, there were almost no flights to Cuba at all; it was cheaper to fly there from Russia than from Mexico, but now it seems to be opening gradually, you can try to get there from Colombia or Panama.


<b>Transport between islands</b>
The main transport in the Caribbean is airplanes. There are a lot of flights, you can fly out every day. Prices are much higher than in the similar muti-island countries like Indonesia. On average, we can assume that each flight in the Lesser Antilles will cost around $150. There are almost no cheap flights from other countries to Cuba, Jamaica, the Bahamas, Turks and Caicos, Cayman; you need to fly through Miami.
The main airlines are LIAT (based in Antigua and Barbados, flies throughout the Lesser Antilles), Insel Air (based in Curacao, there are also flights to Brazil, Colombia, Guyana), WinAir, Caribbean Airlines (based in Jamaica and Trinidad), Air Antilles (based in Guadeloupe).
It is believed that Caribbean airlines are often late, but I had almost no problems. Only a couple of flights were delayed by two hours.

Water transport is poorly developed and expensive. I will list the ferries that you can actually use.
1. From Saint Martin to Anguilla (many times a day), Saint Barthelemy (several times a day, you can go there and back in a day), Saba (once a day, only overnight)
2. Between the islands of Saint Lucia, Martinique, Dominica, Guadeloupe - Express des Iles. In 2022 departures were two to three times a week, previously it was more often. I personally took this ferry twice, it’s cheaper than a plane - tickets cost 50-80 euros.
3. Between the US and British Virgin Islands - many times a day
4. From Miami to the Bahamas - several times a day, you can make a day trip, but only to the nearest city of Freeport.
Within countries, ferry services are usually better: there are regular services between Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, etc.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-802083_original.jpg" title=""/>
You can travel on a cruise ship. If you are alone, then it will be more expensive than an airplane, even taking into account the fact that you do not need to pay for food and hotel, but you can eat well and stay in a nice room. On a cruise you will only have one day per island, but this is usually enough for small islands. No one will prohibit you from using public transport. Cruises are aimed at retirees, and not at those who like to travel around more countries, so it is difficult to visit many countries at once on one cruise - they rarely last more than 7-8 days, there are days at sea, they can go to different islands of one country (Bahamas, Virgin Islands) . Since most cruises depart from Miami and Puerto Rico, it is very difficult to travel around the Lesser Antilles on a cruise. Rates start at $200 per day per cabin. People constantly write to me that you can catch some cruises much cheaper, but for this you need to plan something very much in advance, and as I said above, there are basically only a few cruises with a good route.

<b>Transport on the islands</b>
Public transport is available on all decently populated islands. Absent mainly on the British colonies because they have small populations. A trip within small islands costs from $0.3 to $2. On large islands such as Cuba and Hispaniola there are intercity buses.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-108964_original.jpg" title=""/>
For specific islands where I was:
Puerto Rico. In the city of Sanjuan there are buses for $0.75. The system is inconvenient: payment is only in cash, they do not give change, you can ONLY pay with coins. The frequency of buses is much less than stated on the website; the bus may suddenly change the route or not arrive. Between cities there are only collective taxis at outrageous prices. The worst island in terms of transport.
US Virgin Islands. There is one circular minibus route on St. Thomas. Travel costs from $1 to $2 depending on distance. It takes about 15 minutes to walk from the airport to the highway with buses.
Saint Martin and Sint Maarten. Buses run on several routes, including at night, very often between the Dutch and French parts of the island. Travel from $1 to $2.
Saint Kitts and Nevis. Minibuses start from the capital, both along the southern and northern coasts. I actually walked to the airport (less than 2 km). The fare starts from 2.5 Caribbean dollars. The ferry to Nevis costs $26-31 depending on the company. Nevis also has minibuses around the perimeter of the island.
Antigua and Barbuda. There are quite frequent minibuses starting from the capital. There seem to be no routes along the coast bypassing the capital. Price from 2.5 Caribbean dollars to 3.5 (across the island I paid that much). There is a ferry to Barbuda, but sailing for an hour and a half on the open sea would be suicide for me. Almost no one lives in Barbuda and there is no public transport there.
Guadeloupe. There are buses on the eastern part of the island with schedules and tariff zones (from 1.5 to 4 euros). There are no timetables for the western part of the island; they go as they fill up. To the city of Basse-Terre it costs about 7 euros. In total, I paid 18 euros for the circle around the western part, although I hitchhiked the last section, since the buses stopped running at 5 pm. There are ferries to the neighboring small islands of Marie-Galante and Desirade.
Dominica. I got sick and only went to Trafalgar Falls near the capital. They charged me 5 Caribbean dollars, although the locals obviously paid less.
Martinique. There are dedicated buses from the airport to the city, 1.45 euros. Long-distance routes run according to schedule; to Saint-Pierre (north of the island) costs 2 euros - cheap for such a distance.
Saint Lucia. There are minibuses without numbers on all major roads, but on Sunday there is no chance of getting to Soufriere. Prices from 2.25 Caribbean dollars.
St. Vincent. Routes clockwise and counterclockwise. From 1 Caribbean dollar (1/3 American). 25 km to Barrualle = 4 dollars = $1.3
Grenada. I was charged 5 Caribbean dollars for travel between the airport area and the capital. I rode for free once on the university bus, which carries students between the two campuses.
Barbados. There are frequent minibuses along the populated southern coast. Price $1 = 2 Barbados
Trinidad. Buses from Port of Spain throughout the island. Minimum 2 Trinidadian dollars (2/7 US). To the airport costs 4.
Curacao. There are two bus stations in the capital, for eastern and western directions. Large buses go to the ends of the island once an hour, minibuses more often. By bus one trip costs 2.20 florins, by minibus 3.
Haiti, Port-au-Prince. Tap-taps around the city from 10 gourdes ($0.15). To the border with the Dominican Republic costs 75 gourdes for 45 kilometers ($1.15).
Dominican Republic. Intercity buses cost approximately 1.5 pesos per kilometer. Around the city from 12-13 pesos by minibus, 20 by metro.
Jamaica. Travel around the city of Kingston by bus costs 100 Jamaican dollars ($0.66), including on long-distance routes (to the airport and suburbs), and collective taxis that travel along major highways cost 150 dollars. From Kingston to Montego Bay (200 km) - $1,100.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-803383_original.jpg" title=""/>
Taxis on small islands are very, very expensive. In Antigua, I paid $30 for a 10-kilometer trip. Uber is only available in Kingston (the capital of Jamaica). It’s worth considering that on Sunday there is no public transport almost anywhere, even in Jamaica, which is why I actually had to take a taxi several times.
I didn’t use car rental because there is no point in it - all the islands are densely populated, and it’s easy to get everywhere by public transport. The only place where Sunday let me down was St. Lucia, but there I had no theoretical chance of renting a car, since I flew into the airport and departed from the port at the other end of the island. The only place where I theoretically considered the possibility of taking a car was Dominica, for a trip to the center of the island, but in fact I did not have enough strength for this. Rental prices are very high, from 50 dollars per day + gasoline is also not cheap.

<b>Accomodation</b>
Accomodation in this region is expectedly expensive. The most expensive ones are in the British and American colonies. British ones are expensive because they focus on finance instead of tourism: 40% of offshore companies in the world are registered in the British Virgin Islands.
Accomodation is also very expensive on independent small islands: St. Kitts, Barbados, Antigua - here everywhere the cheapest room without air conditioning costs from $50, there are no hostels. The high prices can be explained by the fact that all these hotels are made exclusively for tourists, mainly American ones, who have infinite amounts of money. Local residents, who do not live very richly, simply do not need hotels, because you can get to any point on the island in one or two hours. The colonies feel somewhat cheaper than independent countries.
I rented accommodation almost everywhere through Airbnb, because it was cheaper than hotels from booking.com, and better. In many places I essentially got a studio apartment, although the kitchen was not very useful, since there was nothing to buy in the store, and I still didn’t feel like cooking rice (although in Guadeloupe I did cook some food).
<i>Airbnb in Martinique, $57</i>
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-797390_original.jpg" title=""/>
The most expensive hotel on the trip, and in my entire travel history, was in St. Kitts: the room cost $87, and this is the cheapest hotel on this island. I played it safe, since in St. Kitts due to covid restrictions I needed to obtain an electronic permit in advance, which indicated the address of your stay, and until April 2022, you could only live in a few hotels, which were even more expensive. There were still a couple of options on airbnb around $60 a day, not in the capital.
<i>The most expensive number in my life:</i>
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-798850_original.jpg" title=""/>
In the Dominican Republic, hotels are cheap, almost like in Asia - I found rooms for $10.
<i>I rented a yacht in Saint Martin for $30 in 2016. In 2022 it was no longer there, and the cheapest accommodation on airbnb was around $50.</i>
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-109227_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Food</b>
Food in the Caribbean is very, very bad. This is probably the worst place in the world in terms of food that I've been to (I guess it's even worse in non-tourist Africa). Even on <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/568312.html">Pacific Islands</a> I ate more varied food. The problem is not even that it is expensive, but simply that there is nothing. One day I walked around the entire capital of Dominica from end to end, and really the most upscale establishment that was there was KFC, the rest were unattractive canteens with approximately the same prices. I believe that the pandemic has also crippled the restaurant industry in all these countries, since the locals clearly do not eat out much, and the tourism industry has collapsed very hard, especially due to the almost complete disappearance of cruises.
Even on the European islands the food situation is not rosy. I came from Dominica to Martinique, I thought that in the evening I would go to some brasserie and try French cuisine with wine there. Well, no. At 6 pm EVERYTHING is closed, even McDonald's, the streets are empty. It was hard to find the only supermarket that was open until 7 in order to have time to buy cheese there.
You can find some restaurants and local cuisine only on the large islands - the Dominican Republic and Jamaica. In the Dominican Republic, in general, it was quite cheap, you could eat for 2-3 dollars, and the cuisine there is reminiscent of Central America. In Jamaica, in the tourist areas you can still find something, I tried a local dish of salted fish with ackee fruit:
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-797870_original.jpg" title=""/>
I went to KFC most often on this trip because there is one on every island (McDonald's is open only in Martinique, Guadeloupe, St. Maarten, Puerto Rico, Bahamas and Dominican Republic). You can compare prices, since the menu is the same everywhere. I took a standard lunch with two pieces of chicken, the cheapest one was on St. Lucia (16 Caribbean dollars ~ 6 US dollars), Dominica 18, Antigua 21, St. Kitts 23. In Jamaica, this lunch costs 840 Jamaican dollars (5.5 US dollars) ).
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-799008_original.jpg" title=""/>
Prices in grocery stores are also impressive - significantly more expensive than even in the USA. I don’t know how people live in Jamaica, where the average salary is about $500 a month, when a dozen eggs cost $4. The prices for fruits and vegetables are simply prohibitive, they are sold individually, as in Japan, and one orange or small apple costs a dollar or so. The selection of goods is extremely poor in all positions.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-801168_original.jpg" title=""/>
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-802460_original.jpg" title=""/>
The only exception are the French islands, where the French provide a Parisian assortment - you can buy cheese, jamon, wine, and baguettes, at prices more or less the same as in France.

<b>Where to go</b>
The Caribbean has a good climate, at least in November - it’s not hot, although in May it got pretty hot in places. There is a hurricane season here, from about mid-June to mid-November, when there is a fairly high risk of problems due to flight delays or cancellations due to weather.
There are no legendary natural beauties in the Caribbean; Indonesia is much better suited for these purposes: better transport accessibility, much cheaper, and there are easily accessible active volcanoes. The islands are different: some are picturesque mountainous (Saint Vincent, Dominica, Saint Martin), others are flatter (Barbados, Trinidad, Antigua, Anguilla).
It’s not worth going to the Caribbean for the beach from Europe - the flight to Southeast Asia is equally long, it costs less, everything is much cheaper locally, the beaches are no worse. I wouldn’t go here from the USA either; it’s better to go to Mexico, Costa Rica, or even Florida, which is actually cheaper. Or to Brazil.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-798448_original.jpg" title=""/>

Now briefly for each country.

Jamaica is a pretty weird country. In terms of crime, it ranks among the world's top somewhere between Honduras and El Salvador. Pros - prices are lower than on smaller islands, and the beaches in the west of the island are generally good. Nice mountains near the capital, included in the UNESCO list.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-796777_original.jpg" title=""/>
Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, it’s interesting to see simply because it has a very high level of sketchiness, although it feels like neighboring Jamaica and the Dominican Republic are not far behind.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-804032_original.jpg" title=""/>
The Dominican Republic is a terrible country, it completely pissed me off on that trip. The only plus is that it is relatively cheap.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-800500_original.jpg" title=""/>
The Bahamas are a lot of small islands near Florida. The capital is decent and quite colorful.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-798060_original.jpg" title=""/>
Puerto Rico is a large island belonging by the United States. The capital San Juan is one of the oldest cities in the New World and is included in the UNESCO list.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-800212_original.jpg" title=""/>
The US Virgin Islands are also part of the USA, small and expensive islands that were once a colony of Denmark.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-801614_original.jpg" title=""/>
Sint Maarten and Saint Martin are one island, divided into Dutch and French parts. One of the most interesting countries in the Caribbean - there is civilization, beautiful nature, goods from Europe, and a famous beach over which planes fly.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-800643_original.jpg" title=""/>
St. Kitts and Nevis is seemingly the richest and most prosperous of the independent countries in the Caribbean, apparently because it has been selling citizenship for the longest time. Nice, although very expensive. There is a powerful fortress on a hill, listed by UNESCO.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-799341_original.jpg" title=""/>
Antigua and Barbuda is also a rich and expensive country. The landscapes are not as volcanic as their neighbors, but also pleasant. There is an old English port listed by UNESCO.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-800992_original.jpg" title=""/>
Guadeloupe is a large French island, or rather two islands separated by a very narrow strait (plus other small islands around). The western island is mountainous, the eastern one is densely populated. It looks pretty shabby, even though it's France.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-803711_original.jpg" title=""/>
Dominica is the poorest and most sparsely populated island, but it has the most untouched nature preserved. The national park is included in the UNESCO list.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-802686_original.jpg" title=""/>
Martinique is a French island, more polished and rich than Guadeloupe. There are volcanoes in the north.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-797689_original.jpg" title=""/>
Saint Lucia is another poor and a little weird island. There are coastal cliffs near the city of Soufriere (also on the UNESCO list), where I could not get to because of Sunday.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-799528_original.jpg" title=""/>
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is the least touristic country, as the airport is too small for large aircraft. The first part of "Pirates of the Caribbean" was filmed there.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-799774_original.jpg" title=""/>
Barbados is the most touristy of the independent islands, with many cruises departing from here. There are no mountains, and everything is densely built up. The capital is included in the UNESCO list for its architecture.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-801419_original.jpg" title=""/>
Grenada is a rather civilized and beautiful country, the capital is really nice, I would put it on the UNESCO list instead of the capital of Barbados.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-803073_original.jpg" title=""/>
Trinidad and Tobago, a non-tourist country near the shores of Venezuela, relies heavily on oil.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-798682_original.jpg" title=""/>
Curacao is a Dutch island away from the rest, off the coast of Colombia. Famous for its colorful capital, included in the UNESCO list.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-802031_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Results</b>
The 2016 trip was very cheap, since I saved as much as possible: I spent about $2100 in three weeks, of which $1300 was all air tickets (I specifically chose countries that were cheaper to fly to) and $800 (about $35 per day) spent for everything else. More than half of that was for hotels, but several times I was lucky to find extremely cheap options on airbnb, plus I lived in hostels for several days, and the Dominican Republic is also generally cheap.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-saint-kitts-and-nevis-110016_original.png" title=""/>
The 2022 trip turned out to be almost exactly $4,000 (also in just over three weeks), of which a little more than half was for air tickets, since here I no longer chose countries, but built a route for all of them that I had not been to. Hootels were quite expensive almost everywhere, averaging $50 a day. I didn’t try to save on food, but since there was nothing there except KFC, it didn’t cost much overall.
