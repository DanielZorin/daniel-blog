I’m leaving the Philippines, so as usual, a final review of this country.

<b>Language</b>
The Philippines was a colony of the United States, and now everyone who works in the service industry here speaks fluent English. The only time I saw people speaking English poorly was at cockfights, where very down-to-earth workers gather. I didn’t try to learn local languages like Tagalog or Cebuano.
The English dialect is unusual, Filipinos love the sound [a], for example, they pronounce the word Madam as [mam].

<b>Money</b>
$1 = 45 Philippine pesos. I withdrew money from ATMs, the maximum you can withdraw is 10,000 pesos (I was charged about $237), while any foreign card is charged a commission of 200 pesos (almost $5).

<b>Intercity Transport</b>
Transportation will be your first and foremost nightmare in the Philippines. You just need to accept that you can only move around this country at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour. This is at best, at worst it will be 20. That is, if you see on the map that you have to travel 100 kilometers, you need to prepare that the trip will take four hours. Due to the terrible, slow and uncomfortable transport, getting around the Philippines is very tiring, in addition, you often have to spend one night at transit points where in another country you would get there during the day.
An airplane is the most practical means of transport over long distances; after all, the Philippines is an island country, so it cannot be traveled by land. The vast majority of flights fly through Manila or Cebu airports. There is a low-cost airline called Cebu Pacific, their prices are 30-50 dollars per flight. Luggage is only 7 kilograms in hand luggage, but you can pay extra for 15 kg of luggage; on domestic flights it only costs about $5. Four flights: Manila - Cagayan de Oro, Camiguin - Cebu - Puerto Princesa - Manila for two cost $320 (one baggage for two).
All other types of transport are much cheaper, but also much slower.
Ferries operate between neighboring islands. I have never suffered from aerophobia or a phobia of any other type of transport, but in the Philippines I developed aquaphobia, if you can call it that. “Ferries” are often small boats that rock like on the roller coaster. I saw normal ferries, like in civilized countries, where you board, like on an airplane, wait for a while and get off, in only one direction: from Cebu to the island of Bohol.
Buses operate on larger islands like Luzon or Cebu. The prices are low, the buses themselves are okay, there are air conditioners, but the speed is very low, and the roads are very bad, so it’s impossible to work or even read anything on the buses, you can only shake. Another incredible misery of the bus system is that often there is no bus station in the city, and each company (and there are dozens of them) has its own terminal. In Manila, many terminals are located in the Cubao area, but the distances there can also be long. Even small Banaue has several terminals. This is the first time I have encountered such a stupid inconvenient system.
They also love bureaucracy in the Philippines; you always need to buy a ticket for the ferry separately and a ticket to enter the terminal separately. I once saw a cash register with two windows. In one they sell a ferry ticket for 12 pesos, and in the next one they pin a piece of paper to it for 2 pesos (!). After 10 meters there is a man who unpins the piece of paper for 2 pesos and throws it into a box. There is a similar system at airports, except in Manila and Cebu, where they have grown to include this fee in the ticket price, as in all normal countries.
Travel prices:
Manila - Batangas, bus, 167 pesos
Banangas - Puerto Galera, ferry, 230 pesos + terminal fee
Manila - Banaue, bus, 530 pesos
Banaue - Baguio, minibus, 360 pesos
Baguio - Angeles, bus, 306 pesos

<b>Urban transport</b>
Urban transport in the Philippines is represented by all sorts of mutants. First of all, these are, of course, the well-known jeepneys. In principle, they are very similar to Russian minibuses, I was even touched when I saw that money for travel is transferred along a chain, just like in my homeland.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945063327_3e8f959b3a_o.jpg" title=""/>
There are also “multicabs”, which are like jeepneys, only converted from a mini-truck.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946300739_3b3817af59_o.jpg" title=""/>
In Mindanao and Camiguin, “motorelas” are used, it’s like a carriage pulled by a motorcycle.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946300734_9e6734c816_o.jpg" title=""/>
Travel on all these things is inexpensive, from 7 to 15 pesos depending on the city. The price depends on the distance, you need to tell the driver where you are going. In jeepneys and multicabs you pay at the entrance, in motorelas you usually pay at the exit.
There are no route numbers anywhere except Cebu City. You can only navigate by the inscriptions on the side.
As for personal transport, in the Philippines we actually had to take a taxi several times due to the lack or extreme inconvenience of public transport. Jeepneys in rural areas are rare and often so crowded that there may not even be enough space on the roof. For example, there is one departure a day from Banaue to Batad - from Batad in the morning and back in the evening. It is clear that this is convenient for residents of the village of Batad, who work in the town of Banaue, but it is inconvenient for tourists, since they need to either spend the night in Batad or take a taxi.
Usually taxis are represented by “tricycles”, this is a motorcycle with a sidecar. In general, there are two seats, but realistically 10 people can fit in there, taking into account the space behind the driver on the motorcycle, the footrests, and the luggage compartment. Prices for tricycles are usually per person, and not for the entire car, like for a taxi. 5-7 kilometers will cost about 25-30 pesos per person, but if you don’t know the price, you can be charged several times more.
There are also motorcycle taxis that two people can ride on.
Taxis are only available in big cities like Manila and Cebu. In Cebu, we took a metered taxi from the airport to the city, it cost as much as 420 pesos (almost $10) and took an hour and a half, because there are hellish traffic jams in Cebu. We got back to the airport for 30 pesos, albeit with two transfers, but we avoided the traffic jams using a ferry. I’ve never taken an auto-taxi in Manila; there are a lot of jeepneys and pedicabs there.

<b>Accomodation</b>
Hotels in the Philippines are poor and not particularly cheap. While in China for 80 yuan ($12) I didn’t know any problems, except how to convince someone to check me into a room, in the Philippines there are always some kind of problems that make even a person as tolerant of inconveniences as me angry. In general, housing in the Philippines, especially at resorts, reminded me most of Crimea or Anapa about five years ago. Those who rented rooms there from the grandmothers will understand.
Most hotels don't have hot water, but that's okay, it's hot there anyway.
There may be such a poor shower that it is scary to go into it.
The toilet may not flush, pour it into a ladle and flush it with your hands.
Ants, lizards or cockroaches may come.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946422000_a82389472b_o.jpg" title=""/>
The quality of hotels does not really correlate with price, so in the most expensive resort by the sea with a pool for $27 a day there was only ice water in the shower. Therefore, you can safely look for housing for 500 pesos, at least you won’t overpay.
By the way, in the Philippines, it seems that shampoos are not in fashion; at least not a single hotel, even an expensive one, has them. It's good that I had stock from China.

<b>Food</b>
Gourmets should not go to the Philippines, the food here is simple. Very reminiscent of what you can buy in a Russian canteen - pieces of chicken, pork in batter. There are no frills at all; in the Philippines they don’t even bother adding salt to the fish or adding any seasonings. Fried it - and that's fine. Filipinos also love fat. If you find a really tasty dish, it will probably be incredibly fatty, almost like the dishes in Mongolia.
What else Russia and the Philippines have in common is that all restaurants have very small portions. You won’t be full even with a whole portion (and in China half is enough). What shocked me most in this regard was McDonald's. I took the Big Tastey, well, to eat to my heart's content, but it turned out to be smaller in size than the Russian Big Mac.
I tested the establishments of the lowest category and I can say that even by my standards it is bad. In such places where local workers dine, there is a counter with various pieces of chicken or pork, with rice always added as a side dish. The saddest thing is that the food is NOT HEATED, meaning you have to eat cold and not very fresh chicken, which once again reminds you of your homeland.
It’s better not to tempt fate and visit more reputable establishments. There are quite a lot of them in tourist places. The dish costs two or three dollars.

Street fast food is very monotonous. All over the country they sell: kebab from chicken heads, kebab from chicken intestines, kebab from chicken legs. I didn’t eat all this. If you're lucky, you can find a normal meat kebab, it usually costs 25 pesos per stick, it's deliciously fried, and most importantly, it's fresh. In Manila, only near the Robinson's shopping center, delicious donuts are sold for 13-15 pesos.
Chains of fast food restaurants are very popular. There are several chains that serve the same chicken, but it's easier to go to a cheaper, non-chain establishment instead. There are McDonald's everywhere. A menu with a Big Mac costs about $4, i.e. by local standards it is not as expensive as in China and is very popular. There is a local chain called Jollibee, which originally copied McDonald's. For fast food it’s pretty good, there’s chicken a la KFC, pieces of meat in mushroom sauce, and burgers (though I didn’t like their mayonnaise). Another good network is Angel burger, it looks like a shawarma tent, but they have pretty good burgers, and at the same time very cheap - for 25-30 pesos (it varies in different cities) they give two burgers, and for 35-40 pesos - two cheeseburgers. The Greenwich pizza chain is offering two delicious pizzas for P250.
The only fruits sold everywhere are avocados, mangoes and bananas. Mangoes cost between 30 and 70 pesos per kilo. Mangoes in the Philippines are small, some are so small that you can’t even cut them, you can only suck out the juice. Bananas are mostly short, cost 1-2 pesos apiece, and are delicious (actually, I don’t rate bananas very much, but here they are really tasty). Avocados cost 25-30 pesos per kilo. There are some other exotic fruits that you need to look for on sale, for example, marang (don’t buy it under any circumstances, you won’t be able to wash off the sticky dirt afterwards, and it has no taste), santol (tasty, but too much), soursop (tasteless crap). Regular apples in the Philippines are exotic, imported from the USA, and cost 15-25 pesos each.

The main local drink is called "buko", this is a terribly cloying, tasteless crap, as if five spoons of sugar were added to a packaged juice. Most of the ice cream has the same nasty, cloying taste, which was a shock to me in the early days. Gradually I found out that you can eat popsicles (unfortunately, not in any store), ice cream from machines called "Miguelito's", as well as fruit shakes, which are made from fresh fruit.


<b>Internet</b>
The Internet is another ambush. Everything is complicated.
Firstly, Wi-fi. Most hotels don't have it, others have it, but it doesn't work. Offhand, only one (!) hotel had wi-fi that worked in the room, it was in Baguio (but there was no proper shower and toilet there). In Puerto Galera, Banaue, Angeles, Cebu, Puerto Princesa it worked well only in the hall; did not work in Cagayan and Dumaguete; in Manila, Tanawan, Sabang, Mambajao it was not there at all.
You shouldn't rely on public Wi-Fi. It is not available in chain cafes. Not at McDonald's, not even at Starbucks.
Now about 3G. There are two main providers: Globe and Smart. SIM cards are sold at any stall, no documents are asked for. Therefore, there are almost no offices of cellular companies. I had a hard time finding a Smart office in Manila and found out about the tariffs there. A SIM card costs 40 pesos (less than a dollar), then you need to put money on it and connect to an Internet package. 1 day costs 50 pesos (just over $1), 7 days - 300 pesos ($7), 30 days - 1000 pesos. Unlimited traffic! I read that in some cities one operator has better reception, in others - another, so I got 7 days packages. In the end, I didn’t buy a Globe card, but in some places Smart really didn’t work well.
3G coverage is not universal, but it is available in all places where you might get as a tourist. 3G is available in large cities and in small villages where there are resorts or attractions. In rural areas, 3G disappears, and 2G is impossible to use.
Since the traffic is unlimited, we often surfed the network via 3G, turning the phone into a hotspot. In some places the speed was simply excellent, for example, in Mambajao on the island of Camiguin, where I downloaded five gigabytes in a couple of hours. In other places, even just loading pages was impossible, for example, in Cebu City. I assumed that in places where there are few users (3G seems to have only recently been installed in Camiguin), the speed is higher, but in large cities there may be jambs. In the village of Sabang on Palawan, everything was fine, but in the regional center of Puerto Princesa, 3G was only available in the city center.
It also happens that 3G is almost impossible to catch indoors, but if you leave it, everything is fine. Thick walls?
You can't talk on Skype over 3G anywhere.
In a month I used up more than 20 gigabytes of mobile traffic.

<b>Navigation</b>
You can navigate around the city using the Maps.me map. The hotels are marked there, although not all of them. GPS often lags, but not as much as in South Korea.

<b>Safety, scams</b>
Considering the terrible poverty and degradation of infrastructure in the country, the Philippines is surprisingly calm. You can walk anywhere, however, after 9-10 pm everything is usually closed, especially in small towns. There is no fraud on the part of the local population, no one is cheating or extorting prices. Except for taxi drivers, but taxi drivers are probably crooks even in Switzerland.

<b>Entertainment</b>
The attractions of the Philippines are beautiful tropical nature and heavenly beaches, all of this is free or there is a symbolic fee. If you take things seriously, you can spend a lot of money on scuba diving (one session $20-30), or go snorkeling. I've been to all sorts of seas, but only now I learned that there is a fashionable name for swimming with goggles or a mask: “snorkeling”. Diving near the shore is, of course, free, but you can charter a boat and sail to some uninhabited areas, where you can see more underwater than on the beach near the hotel.
Another expensive entertainment in the Philippines is sex tourism; there are a lot of prostitutes in big cities, and most tourists have no other reasons to stay there.
Other than that, I don’t know what I can really spend money on. The resorts offer excursions around the area, but all of these places can be reached on your own with a minimum of difficulty by jeepney or tricycle. In general, there is no point in taking excursions (except diving), since their prices are greatly inflated.
There was nothing at all for paid entertainment:
Entrance to Batad village with rice terraces - 50 pesos
View the giant clam farm in Camiguin - 25 pesos
Entrance to the waterfall in Camiguin - 30 pesos
Entrance to the Chocolate Hills Observation Deck - 50 pesos
Entry to cockfights - 100 pesos
Boat rental to sail from Camiguin Island to Mantigue Island - 550 pesos
Swimming with whale sharks on Cebu Island - 1000 pesos
Puerto Princesa Underground River on the island of Palawan - 290 pesos entrance + 180 per person boat rental (if you get 6 people, it will cost 120). It costs another 400 pesos to get there by minivan. Total less than 900 pesos, for comparison, an excursion at a travel agency costs 1,500.

<b>Other expenses</b>
Hair salons are very cheap in the Philippines. A haircut, even in a very decent-looking salon, costs 50 pesos (1 dollar), coloring - 300-400 pesos.

<b>Resume</b>
If you are not a fan of traveling through the ass  of the world, I would rather not recommend going to the Philippines. For me, the constant, almost daily, irritation from poor housing, tasteless food, terrible transport and slow Internet outweighed the pleasure from the local beauties. I definitely won’t be <i>traveling</i> to the Philippines for the second time. If you come here for a long period of time to a single place, then in a few days you can find decent housing and food there and have a pleasant time.
In just 29 days, expenses amounted to $1,548 for two, that is, $53 per day. How is it that everyone writes that China is an expensive country, and there you can have a blast with a budget of $40 a day and not have any worries, but in the Philippines for $53 it’s pure agony?

Well, in conclusion, a few nice places worth visiting.

Banaue is probably the number 1 place in the Philippines.
