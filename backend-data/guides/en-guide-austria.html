In June I visited Western Europe again after a long break. I didn't write reviews of most European countries, because I visited most of them differently than distant countries where I cover most of the sights in one trip. In Europe, I have been to almost all countries 2-5 times, usually in different places each time. I will take this opportunity to summarize my impressions of some countries over the years.
I have been to Austria four times:
May 2012 - Vienna (<a href="http://goo.gl/jRvcQX">part I</a>, <a href="http://goo.gl/ydAgw6">part II</a> )
November 2012 - <a href="http://goo.gl/K93RPk">Vienna</a> (+ Hungary)
July 2013 - <a href="http://goo.gl/PMi7ta">Braunau am Inn</a>, <a href="http://goo.gl/MHBDiU">Salzburg</a> , <a href="http://goo.gl/ZgGTsR">Feldkirch</a> (part of a trip to Bavaria, Austria and Switzerland)
June 2023 - Vienna, St. Pölten, Linz, Graz, Klagenfurt, Lienz

<b>Transport</b>
As in most European countries, the main transport in Austria is trains. There are two companies here - the state-owned OEBB and the private Westbahn. Westbahn operates only on the route Vienna - Linz - Salzburg (the most popular route), their prices are more or less the same as OEBB.
Tickets can be purchased at <a href="https://oebbtickets.at">oebbtickets.at</a>. Prices are quite high - for example, a half hour trip from Vienna to St. Pölten costs 15 euros. An hour and a half to Linz - 40 euros. If you buy a ticket much in advance, you can get a promotional fare; the minimum price from Vienna to Linz is 10 euros, but this must be bought more than two weeks in advance. The line to Linz is high-speed (Railjet class), travel on the local line (Regional) is much cheaper, for example Klagenfurt - Lienz costs 21 euros for 2.5 hours. But high-speed lines are often not duplicated by regional ones. Therefore, in Austria, unlike Germany, it is problematic to travel purely on slow trains.
In Austria there is an analogue of German land tickets: Einfach Raus Ticket. For two people it costs 36 euros (for each additional person +4 euros) and allows you to travel all day unlimited on local trains. But since there are few local trains, this only makes sense if you want to travel a lot in one narrow region. My route, for example, from Linz to Graz (3rd and 2nd largest cities) would take five hours one way.

There are buses, in particular Flixbus, in Austria, but not very many. On the Graz - Klagenfurt OEBB route, they offer bus instead of trains, as it is faster.

<b>Food</b>
Austria is not as famous for its culinary scene as France or Italy. But there are several well-known dishes here - at least Wiener schnitzel and strudel pie.
Menu of a typical Austrian restaurant:
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945069252_29b646f162_o.jpg" title=""/>
As you can see, dishes start at 15 euros. In the same place, a business lunch costs 12 euros. Strudel pie costs 6 euros.

At the kebab shop, kebabs cost 5.5-8 euros, pizza from 8.50 euros.

<b>Accomodation</b>
Housing in Austria is expensive, you can hardly find anything for less than 40 euros, you should rather count on 50+. Vienna is cheaper than other cities because there is much more choice.

<b>What to see</b>
Austria is divided into nine states, of which I have been to 8. The only one I have not been to is Burgenland, along the border with Hungary (not counting transit through it by train).
Austria was not so affected by the war, so all major cities have well-preserved historical centers. I have been to all major cities except Innsbruck (the capital of the state of Tyrol). Of the famous small towns, I have not been to Hallstatt.
Vienna is the capital of the Austrian Empire. Of course, World Heritage.

Also a separate point is Schönbrunn Palace
