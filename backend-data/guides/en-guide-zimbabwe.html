There are more than 50 countries in Africa, and I, of course, wanted to visit several at a time - not so much for the quantity, but in order to feel how African countries differ from each other. Africa has few popular attractions and tourism in general. From a distance, many countries look similar.
Africa is conventionally divided into northern, western, eastern, central and southern parts. Southern Africa, in addition to South Africa, definitely includes Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Zambia and Botswana. You can also include Angola here (sometimes it is classified as central Africa) and Malawi (this country is logistically and economically closer to Tanzania, so it can also be classified as eastern Africa).
Of course, while in the region, I wanted to visit Victoria Falls, on the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe. Botswana is also not far away, these are already four countries. Eswatini is also close to South Africa, and small, and right next to Eswatini is the capital of Mozambique, where a ticket from Johannesburg costs only $60, and visas to Mozambique have recently been abolished. Somehow it ended up like this:

<b>Visas</b>
A pleasant feature of the southern part of Africa in comparison with the rest of the continent is that there is almost no need to apply for visas in advance; most countries are even free, like in South America or Southeast Asia. In East Africa you have to pay everywhere, and on the West Coast you need visas almost everywhere, which makes travel arrangements more difficult.
Botswana - no visa, free
Zimbabwe - visa on arrival $30 single, $40 multiple
Zambia - visa on arrival $25 single entry, $40 double entry, $75 multiple entry, $10 one day visa to visit Victoria Falls
There is also a joint Zambia and Zimbabwe visa (KAZA), which costs $50 and allows you to visit and travel between both countries. However, it is inconveniently made that this visa can only be obtained and used at the following crossings: Harare, Lusaka, Victoria Falls, Livingstone airports, and land borders at Victoria Falls and at the junction of the borders with Namibia. But when I traveled by land from Harare to Lusaka, I had to get a single-entry Zambian visa at the border. Well, at least I entered Zimbabwe for the second time without any problems, so I paid just an extra $10
Eswatini - no visa, free
Mozambique - no visa, upon entry you have to pay 650 meticals (about 11 dollars). I wanted to pay by card, but they only take Visa, and I only had Mastercard on hand. So I gave 200 rands in cash. At the entrance they looked at and copied the hotel address several times, and they looked at the return ticket too, so it’s good that I photoshopped it.
Malawi - visas were also abolished this year, previously there was a problematic visa
Namibia - no visa, free
Angola - no visa
Lesotho - you need a visa, and it's a bit of a mess. To get a visa, you need to send a whole bunch of documents by email, including questionnaires filled out in strict forms and even some certificates from a doctor that you are healthy (people photoshopped them). In response, they will send you an entry permit, you can come with it, and then in the capital you will receive the visa itself (and pay for it), which also takes several hours of the local bureaucracy. There is also evidence that you can travel by land anyway, by paying the border guards at the entrance; the amounts quoted vary from 300 to 1000 rand ($15-50) depending on the crossing and the duration of the trip.

<b>Money</b>
Zimbabwe has a very interesting situation. Zimbabwe was once famous for its record hyperinflation and $100 trillion bills. As a result, Zimbabwean dollars were canceled and switched to American ones. Then they made new Zimbabwean dollars, which were initially 1 to 1, but began to fall again. In the last couple of years, the rate has taken off and is now somewhere in the region of 12,000-15,000 per 1 USD. Moreover, the largest bill is 100 Zimbabwean dollars, that is, these bills are only suitable for small change. In fact, there are practically no Zimbabwean dollars in circulation. Everyone pays in American, less often in rands. At the same time, the cash shortage is severe. Not only is it impossible to get change less than $1 in principle. Finding change from other banknotes is also difficult. I walked through five huge supermarkets in Harare before I could get change from a $10 note. Cash registers are almost empty everywhere, and $1 bills need to be treasured. In supermarkets, you can actually pay by card (locals mostly do that), if you are not afraid that the bank will block it.

Zambia: $1 = 27 ZMW (Zambian Kwacha).
Botswana: $1 = 14 BWP (Botswana Pula).
Mozambique: $1 = 65 MZN (Mozambican metical).
Eswatini: $1 = 19 SZL (lilangeni singular, emalangeni plural). Lilangeni is pegged to the South African rand 1:1, you can pay in rands too.

<b>Accomodation</b>
In all the cities I visited, hotels were available and were of acceptable quality. Some were really good, some were dirty, but I didn’t come across anything really terrible. I paid between 15 and 30 dollars per night. The most expensive country is Zimbabwe, where 30 is rather the lower limit.
Hotel in Gaborone for $30:

Hotel in Lusaka for $14:
<img src="images/guide-zimbabwe-921569_original.jpg" title=""/>

The peculiarity of cities in these countries is that they are built according to the American principle - in the center there is a small “downtown” (in the realities of Africa - a bazaar), and around there are extensive one-story areas, where everything is for cars and distances are long. The exception is Mozambique, where it's like Europe. Most often, hotels, especially those listed on booking.com, are located in residential areas, and even the ones closest to the center are still 1.5-2 kilometers away on foot. Because of this, you need to constantly take a taxi.
In fact, there may also be hotels in the center, but you can't book them online. At least in Bulawayo (Zimbabwe) and Manzini (Eswatini) I settled in the very center near the bus station, and it turned out well. Hotel in Eswatini near the bus station for $25:

<b>Transport</b>
Air connections in Africa in general are not very good (especially in western and central Africa), in the south the capital airports are more or less connected, or you can fly with a transfer in Johannesburg. The best route network is from Harare airport. Domestic flights are expensive because the countries are not so big and rich that most would choose a plane over a bus.
So I traveled overland. There used to be trains here, but almost all of them closed during Covid, just like in South Africa. There are still buses. For long distances, full-size buses (not minibuses) are used. The most comfortable ones were in Zimbabwe - there you could even charge your phone via USB. In Zambia and Botwana, buses have 5 seats in a row instead of 4 (two on the left and three on the right), meaning the seats are more crowded than usual. At the same time, in both Zambia and Botswana, buses broke down on the way (I don’t know, a coincidence or a norm?). In Zambia, I simply bought a ticket for a bus from another company, but in Botswana it broke down on the highway, and all passengers had to hitchhike.
<img src="images/guide-zimbabwe-923987_original.jpg" title=""/>
By the way, about hitchhiking. I hitchhiked in three countries - Zimbabwe, Botswana and Eswatini. Drivers are very willing to give lifts for money. Since I tried to travel as quickly as possible, I didn’t insist on free ride (although this is also possible; I even got a free ride in Eswatini). Locals travel this way very often, since there is not much public transport, so the drivers themselves even stop at bus stops in search of passengers.
In Mozambique and Eswatini I traveled by minibuses (the distances were short). In Eswatini, minibuses are filled to capacity; people ride while standing.
<img src="images/guide-zimbabwe-922256_original.jpg" title=""/>
Travel prices:
Harare - Lusaka, $20 (bus, 11 hours)
Lusaka - Livingstone, 350 kwacha / $12 (bus)
Choma - Livingston, 250 kwacha / $9 (moved because the first bus broke down)
Victoria Falls - Hwange, $5 (bus, 2 hours)
Hwange - Bulawayo, $15 (hitchhiking)
Bulawayo - border with Botswana, $5 (minibus)
Border - Francistown, 50 pula / $3 (minibus)
Francistown - Gaborone, 180 pula / $13 (bus)
Somewhere near Palapye - Gaborone, 100 pula / $6 (hitchhiking)
Gaborone - Rustenburg, 250 pula / $18 (minibus)
Maputo - border with Eswatini, 200 meticals / $3 (minibus)
Border - Hlane Park, 40 rand / $2 (minibus)
Manzini - Mbabane, 30 rand / $1.5 (minibus)
Manzini - Emalahleni, R320 / $17 (minibus)

To my shame, I have never traveled around cities by public transport, mainly due to lack of time. Mostly there are overcrowded minibuses.
There are app-based taxis in every country I've been to. In Zambia and Mozambique it's Yango (international version of Yandex.taxi). Other countries have their own applications, I used the Zimbabwean Hwindi; Botswana and Eswatini have their own applications.
Also, the inDrive application, which I know from Pakistan, works almost everywhere; prices are usually the lowest there. For example, from Harare airport to the hotel it cost me $15, versus the official $30 (though it’s still expensive). Taxis are expensive in Zimbabwe; even in the city center, trips cost $4-5. In Zambia it’s already twice as cheap, and in Mozambique for $2-3 you can even get to the airport on the outskirts.

<b>Food</b>
There are usually few restaurants in these countries, and they are located somewhere on the outskirts (due to the American-like layout of cities). In the center you can only eat at fast food joints, fortunately there are quite a lot of them and they are inexpensive. The most popular ones are the well-known KFC and its South African counterpart Hungry Lion, with a very similar assortment.
Interesting arithmetic. Here are the prices at Hungry Lion in Zambia, Lusaka:
<img src="images/guide-zimbabwe-921269_original.jpg" title=""/>
And this is in Botswana, Francistown. The exchange rate is 1:2, but the price figure in Zambia is only one and a half times higher, that is, Zambia is cheaper. But in any case, a huge combo costs 3-4 dollars.
<img src="images/guide-zimbabwe-917395_original.jpg" title=""/>
Zimbabwe is the most expensive place. Here are the prices of KFC in Harare. The Streetwise 2 combo costs $4.50 (actually $5, since there is no change).
<img src="images/guide-zimbabwe-919127_original.jpg" title=""/>
In Botswana the same combo is 38 pula ($2.70)
<img src="images/guide-zimbabwe-917729_original.jpg" title=""/>
In Eswatini, 8 wings cost R56 ($3). In Zimbabwe - $5.50.
<img src="images/guide-zimbabwe-922692_original.jpg" title=""/>
There is even cheaper food - in canteens. You can eat there even in Zimbabwe for 2-3 dollars; in other countries it’s even cheaper.
<img src="images/guide-zimbabwe-919508_original.jpg" title=""/>
The food looks something like this. On the left is the same corn porridge from South Africa, only in Zimbabwe it is called “sadza”.
<img src="images/guide-zimbabwe-917170_original.jpg" title=""/>
There are supermarkets in all these countries, which was a surprise to me. It turns out that Zambia is a more developed country than India, because there are many more supermarkets in Zambia. In Zambia, the supermarket actually looks good. And locally produced beef costs only $6 per kilogram.
<img src="images/guide-zimbabwe-922014_original.jpg" title=""/>
Zimbabwe has the most “Soviet” supermarkets with a meager assortment.
<img src="images/guide-zimbabwe-918549_original.jpg" title=""/>
You shouldn’t buy fruit in supermarkets; the price difference with the street prices is very large. You can buy everything very cheap on the street; for example, I bought a huge pile of mangoes (at least two kilograms) for $1 in the expensive country of Zimbabwe.
<img src="images/guide-zimbabwe-919918_original.jpg" title=""/>
Prices in Eswatini.
<img src="images/guide-zimbabwe-922939_original.jpg" title=""/>
I would like to especially mention Mozambique, this is the only country where I found a nicer restaurant and ate excellent seafood.
<img src="images/guide-zimbabwe-923574_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Internet</b>
Zimbabwe. Internet is quite expensive here. I bought a SIM card at the airport for $8 with 7 GB of internet. But it turned out that this is the lousiest operator that works normally only in large cities.
Zambia. Internet is very cheap. A SIM card costs 10 kwacha, and for another 20 kwacha I got 2 gigabytes of internet for a week (which was enough for me). Total 30 kwacha - a little more than $1. SIM cards are sold on every corner, but not everyone can register; I wandered around the city for a long time until I came across a stall that does it.
Botswana. I was there for a short time and did not buy a SIM card. They are not sold as widely as in other countries; you need to go to the operator’s office.
Mozambique. I bought a SIM card with a bunch of internet from some guys on the street for 150 meticals (a little over 2 dollars), and they registered it right away.
Eswatini. I bought it again on the street, in Manzini and Mbabane there are sellers sitting under umbrellas. Paid 100 rand ($5) for a SIM card and several gigabytes of internet.

<b>Other</b>
In Botswana and Eswatini the sockets are the same as in South Africa.
Zimbabwe and Zambia have British type sockets.
In Mozambique the sockets are European.
Road traffic in all southern African countries is on the left.

<b>Attractions</b>
<b>Zimbabwe</b>. The capital Harare is an African metropolis.
<img src="images/guide-zimbabwe-919698_original.jpg" title=""/>
The second city of Bulawayo is clearly prettier than the capital.
<img src="images/guide-zimbabwe-923750_original.jpg" title=""/>
Victoria Falls - I visited from Zambia.
In addition, there are ruins of the ancient city of Great Zimbabwe near the city of Masvingo. There are several safari parks that are quite expensive. The largest one is near the city of Hwange, from which I hitchhiked towards Bulawayo. I was never able to fully understand how much it costs to visit it. Entrance costs $20, I also found a price list for lodging in the park, it starts at $50 per person. But I couldn’t find anywhere how much a game drive costs. It may not be available for walk-in at all. At the same time, a full tour from Victoria Falls for the whole day costs from $250 per person, this is even without an overnight stay. In general, a safari in Zimbabwe is expensive.

<b>Zambia</b>. Lusaka is the capital.
<img src="images/guide-zimbabwe-921641_original.jpg" title=""/>
Victoria Falls is one of the most famous waterfalls in the world.
<img src="images/guide-zimbabwe-920923_original.jpg" title=""/>
Apart from this, I don’t know what you can visit here. There are several national parks, but they are far away. The most accessible park is South Luangwa (in the east closer to Mozambique). Theoretically, you can get there by public transport, but it will be long and slow. You can only rent a car in Zambia in Lusaka, and it costs closer to $100/day, and in the park you need 4WD, which is much more expensive. The prices there are approximately the following: a bed in a hostel $30/day, a private room $80/single, $120/double; safari $50 per person. That is, about twice as expensive as in South Africa/Eswatini.

<b>Botswana</b>. I have only been to two major cities: Gaborone and Francistown.
<img src="images/guide-zimbabwe-918458_original.jpg" title=""/>
There are two popular parks: Chobe and Okavango. Many people go there from Victoria Falls, as it is close. There are a lot of animals in these parks, but lodging prices are very, very high. As I understand it, the only option that is not super expensive is a boat safari in Chobe Park, then you don’t have to spend the night inside.
<img src="images/guide-zimbabwe-917817_original.jpg" title=""/>
<b>Mozambique</b>. A former colony of Portugal, Portuguese is spoken here. I was only in the capital, Maputo, which is close to South Africa and Eswatini. The city turned out to be very pleasant - calm, beautiful, there is colonial architecture, an embankment, restaurants. Great food. The prices are low - you can eat a giant crab for $8.
<img src="images/guide-zimbabwe-923176_original.jpg" title=""/>
Mozambique has bad roads, the country has just begun to rise from its knees after the civil war. Therefore, traveling here is not very comfortable yet - trips overland are very long. Domestic flights are not cheap (around $150). But I hope someday I will return to Mozambique, because the country is quite interesting. There are good beaches (Tofo, Bazaruto) and old towns (Beira, Mozambique island), and diving spots.

<b>Eswatini</b>. A small country between South Africa and Mozambique. Quite comfy, with good roads, in general it is not much different from South Africa in terms of infrastructure, but it is safe. The two main cities I visited were Manzini (the transport hub) and Mbabane (the capital).
<img src="images/guide-zimbabwe-922379_original.jpg" title=""/>
I also visited Hlane National Park, fortunately it can be easily reached by public transport. Prices are not high: entrance is about $3, renting a house for the night is $45, jeep game drive is $25, food in the restaurant is cheap.
<img src="images/guide-zimbabwe-920189_original.jpg" title=""/>
<img src="images/guide-zimbabwe-920547_original.jpg" title=""/>
In addition to Hlane, there is also the Mkhaya Nature Reserve, where there are also many animals, but it is more difficult to get there. Other reserves in Eswatini are not so rich in animals; they offer more hilly landscapes.

<b>Results</b>
Over almost three weeks, I spent about $2,500, including round-trip flights to Johannesburg ($550 on Qatar airways). As expected, a lot was spent on taxis, but little on food.
<img src="images/guide-zimbabwe-916605_original.png" title=""/>
Overall, I liked traveling around Africa; it turned out to be much more comfortable than I expected, even in the poorest countries. And quite fun too. I want to travel to other countries, at least to East Africa (Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda). Someday maybe to the west from Morocco to Benin, it should be epic, but you need at least two months so as not to spend all the time on the road, and to get a new passport with blank pages for visas. Namibia and Angola are also an interesting destination, but further to the DR Congo it is difficult to get a visa now (although you can bypass it and go straight to the Republic of the Congo and Gabon).
