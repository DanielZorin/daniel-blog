The USA is the strangest, most incomprehensible, alien country of all 126 countries that I have seen. Japan and India were not even close. In America everything is upside down. The city center can be the most miserable area, where homeless people and drug addicts live. Cities are built for cars with huge parking lots near every building, and you won’t see people in them, as if it’s the eternal first of January. Distances and weather are indicated in strange units of measurement, locals use strange technologies (for example, for communication and payments) that cannot be found in other countries. This is one of the most expensive and difficult countries to travel to.

I've been to 22 of the 50 states:

At the moment I have been to the USA 5 times:
2013 - New York, Philadelphia, Washington
2014 - California, Texas, Louisiana
2016 - Boston, Chicago, Miami
2018 - Niagara Falls, Cleveland, Georgia, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Seattle, Portland
2020 - New Mexico, Hawaii
The last trip turned out to be the longest (15 days), and in total I spent about two months in this country.

<b>Geography</b>
The United States is made up of 50 states, plus the District of Columbia, which is not technically a state. <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/tag/puerto%20rico">Puerto Rico</a> and <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/tag/us%20virgin %20islands">US Virgin Islands</a> do not have passport control with the main US territory, but are still overseas possessions, along with the islands in the Pacific Ocean - <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/tag /guam">Guam</a> and <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/tag/northern%20mariana%20islands">Northern Mariana</a>.
Conventionally, all states can be divided into approximately the following groups:
- New England and the Northeast are the original 13 states that won independence from Britain. Main cities: New York (the main and largest city of the country), Boston (the oldest city in the region, a university center), Philadelphia (the first capital, the place where the Declaration of Independence was signed), Washington DC (the capital).
- Midwest - the region around the Great Lakes, formerly an industrial center, and now called the “rust belt”. Main cities: Chicago (third city in the country, and second in skyscrapers), St. Louis
- The South is the part that tried to secede during the Civil War. Then it was agrarian and depended on the labor of slaves on plantations, now it is the poorest part of the country, all the states with the lowest GDP are located here. The state of Florida stands apart, as it was settled and developed later, and culturally it is distinct from the South. Main cities: Atlanta (the main city of the black South), Miami (famous resort), New Orleans, Houston, Dallas, San Antonio
- Center. Wild lands inland, with low population densities and long distances. The Great Plains, then the Rocky Mountains, then the deserts of Utah and Arizona. Most of the Native Americans live here, there are some unusual regions, like Utah inhabited by Mormons or the ex-piece of Mexico in Arizona and New Mexico. Most of the famous national parks are located in this region. Main cities: Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, Albuquerque, Phoenix, Denver.
- West Coast. Three rich states: California, Oregon and Washington, where the IT and entertainment industries are concentrated. Main cities: Los Angeles (second city in the country, Hollywood), San Francisco (Google, Apple, Facebook), Seattle (Microsoft, Amazon)
- Alaska is the largest and northernmost state.
- The Hawaiian Islands are a piece of Polynesia in America. I’ll tell a little more about this state.

There are 8 Hawaiian islands, of which I have been to four main ones:
- Oahu is the most populated island (by far), where the large city of Honolulu with skyscrapers is located. You can visit the war memorial at the Pearl Harbor base, but there is not much else to see on the island, there are too many tourists, so I would not recommend staying there for more than 1 day
- Hawaii, also known as the Big Island, is the most interesting island. It's home to Volcanoes National Park, Mauna Kea, the highest mountain, and tons of cool scenery, plus it's the only island with reasonable housing prices.
- Maui is the most expensive island. You can see the national park on top of the Haleakala volcano, but I was less impressed with it than on the Big Island.
- Kauai is also a very expensive island, but it’s worth coming here for the Waimea Canyon - it’s like the Grand Canyon, only in the tropics.
There are also the small and not particularly interesting islands of Lanai and Molokai, as well as two closed islands: Kahoolawe (the American military trained there for a long time in cannon shooting, since the 1990s it has been a nature reserve) and Niihau (the island is privately owned, accessible by invitation from the hosts).

<b>Cars and roads</b>
Due to the long distances and numerous natural attractions that are not served by public transport, a car is essential for exploring this country outside of the major cities.
Traffic rules are approximately the same as in Russia and Europe, with a few exceptions:
- You can turn right when the traffic light is red (giving way)
- There is a Stop sign, and there is a Stop 4-way sign. The first has the same meaning as usual (stop + give way), and the second means that after stopping you need to let all the cars that are already at the intersection pass, and then go. In Europe on such intersections priority to the right rule usually applies.
- The double solid line can be crossed to enter a yard/gas station/parking lot on the left. It’s logical, because on the main street there are establishments one after another. If the street with businesses is large, there may be a special lane in the middle for turning left (indicated on the left and right by one continuous and one broken line) - you pull into it, let oncoming people pass, and turn.
- It is not necessary to turn on low beam headlights during the day

The signs look different, but are all intuitive. Instead of many pictogram signs in the United States, text signs are used, for example, “Do not pass” instead of the “No passing” sign.
Sometimes you see a sign “Engine brake use prohibited”, at first I was surprised why engine braking would be prohibited, but it turned out that this only applies to trucks on which you can somehow brake in a clever way, not just by downshifting, and this is very noisy, therefore prohibited in some localities.
The traffic organization is very convenient, so as to minimize the number of potential violations of rules and accidents. For example, it’s very nice that in America it doesn’t happen that you are driving straight in your lane, and suddenly it turns out that now this lane is only for turning right/left, as very often happens in Moscow. Before the intersection there will be a slight widening (using the shoulder or divider) and turning lanes will appear.
If the intersection is large enough, left turns will follow the arrow at the traffic light. At smaller intersections there will be a regular traffic light, and there will always be a reminder “Turn left, giving way to oncoming traffic.”
If there are fewer than three lanes on the road in the opposite direction, there will most likely be a sign at the intersection prohibiting turning around, so that no one tries, like in traffic police exams, to turn sharply while everyone else is turning.
There is no “Main Road” sign here; by default you are on the main road, and if you are on a secondary road, then there will be a “Give Way” sign or, more often, a Stop sign. In general, cities are usually structured in such a way that there is a grid of main streets (if the city is small - one main street, also known as a highway), onto which smaller streets open, onto which streets from courtyards/residential areas open. It doesn’t happen like in Europe, when the main road turns somewhere and you need an addition to the sign indicating the direction, so the sign itself is essentially not needed.
The speed limit here is higher than in Europe and comparable to Russia, but unlike Russia, the increased limit is reasonable, since the streets here are very wide and there are practically no pedestrians. The default in the city is 25 mph (about 40 km/h), but on main streets higher up it can be 35-45. A lower limit of 15 miles per hour is set near schools, but it is often specified that it is in effect when a special yellow light is flashing.
There are two types of intercity highways - Interstate and US Highway. On Interstates there are no traffic lights, all entries and exits are only through interchanges. The US highway can suddenly turn into the main street of a city. Otherwise, both kinds of roads are of good quality; outside the city there is usually a divider and two lanes in each direction. One lane in each direction without a divider occurs on smaller highways or in Hawaii.

Stopping and parking
This is all complicated. This is not Russia, where you can abandon your car anywhere and nothing will happen to you. In America, you can park your car for a long time in only one place - at home. In any other place, such as a rest area on the highway, there will be a sign that after a number of hours (maximum 24) you will be given a hefty fine and the car will be towed away.
You can't stop just anywhere either. There are usually signs on the highways that only an emergency stop is allowed, but if it is not Interstate, then in principle you can pull over to the side of the road for a short time, although it is not always convenient for this, there may be an incline. This was a problem for me, because rest areas are at best once every 50 kilometers, and more often once every 100, so I didn’t miss one to get at least a little rest.
In the city you can stop near shops, gas stations and other businesses, but very often there is a sign there that parking is for customers only, so you won’t be able to go for a walk around the city. Although I sometimes left it in the parking lots of large supermarkets and shopping centers for a short time, it seems that they don’t really monitor it there. Under no circumstances should you leave your car in a residential area; they will report you and tow you away. The only option left is parking along the city center sidewalks. If the city is small, then this is usually no problem; you drive off the main road into the downtown areas and look for a place to stop there. Typically there will be signs allowing parking for a maximum of 2 hours. I read that in some cities there are special cars that drive around and take pictures of everyone to identify who has been standing for more than 2 hours, and in some they do it the old fashioned way by hand, marking the car wheel with chalk on the first pass. If the city is large, parking in the center will most likely be paid; there is a parking meter near each spot, in which you need to pay 1-3 dollars per hour, while the maximum of 2 hours still does not go anywhere. If the city is very large, then it is better not to go there by car, or be prepared to pay a lot and look for a place for a long time (perhaps not on the street, but in a private paid parking lot). I was only in two relatively large cities: I got to Santa Fe on a Sunday, when the parking meters are turned off and everywhere is free, and in Albuquerque I found a place where there are no parking meters near the downtown, two or three blocks from the center. The city website has a map of downtown, which shows streets where there are no parking meters.

Fuel
Gasoline costs about $2 - $2.5 per gallon (that's 3.8 liters). There are gas stations in cities, but I haven’t seen them on the highways. There are no employees at gas stations, so you need to go to the store when filling up, say the number and the amount of money, then return to the car, open the gas tank, select the type of gasoline, insert the hose into the gas tank and press the trigger. When the paid amount of gasoline is filled, or if the tank is filled earlier, the trigger will click. If the tank is filled earlier, then the amount for which you actually filled up will be debited from the card. If you paid in cash, you need to go to the cashier again to pick up your change. Theoretically, the machines at the gas station accept cards on their own without a cashier, but this does not work with foreign cards - I was kicked off the moment I entered the ZIP code (postal code). And at the checkout the card worked only once in a while; several times I had to pay in cash.
There are three types of gasoline, but as I understand it, if you aren't on a Lamborghini, then you need to fill it with the Regular type (the cheapest one). There are separate hoses with diesel fuel, but it is unlikely that diesel cars are available for rental.
In the Hawaiian Islands, gasoline is twice as expensive as on the mainland ($4/gallon).

Insurance
In the USA, there are two main types of insurance: Supplementary Liability insurance (SLI, another name is Extended Protection) - insurance of damage to third parties, and Collision damage waiver (CDW) - insurance of damage to the car itself.
It is often said that SLI = Russian OSAGO, and CDW = CASCO, but this is not entirely true. There is an analogue of compulsory motor liability insurance in the USA, and each car owner must insure his liability for a certain minimum amount, which varies from state to state. In six states, compulsory motor liability insurance is not formally mandatory. In Arizona, Texas, Mississippi and Massachusetts, you need to pay a hefty deposit. In Virginia, you can pay $500 a year to drive without insurance (why, since insurance is obviously cheaper?). And only in New Hampshire there is freedom, it just says that you are financially responsible for any damage.
Depending on the state, the amount of coverage varies, but everywhere it is relatively small - on the order of several tens of thousands of dollars. Since any treatment more complicated than a cold in the USA costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, in essence such insurance covers rather material damage (scratches on someone else’s car).
In fact, most Americans have general insurance that covers a lot of things, including car-related, including liability, for more than the minimum required. These policies are tied to the person, not the vehicle, and also apply to rental cars.
If you are a foreigner, then you do not have such insurance, which means that by default only the minimum coverage required by law is in effect (the owner of the car - the rental company - is still required to have this before renting out the car). This also applies to those Americans who do not have their own car (for example, residents of New York). For such cases, SLI exists - it has standard coverage of up to a million dollars.
CDW is a thing similar to CASCO, but formally it is not insurance, because... it does not involve payments to you personally. This is precisely a waiver, that is, a waiver of claims against you by the rental company. The insurance itself for car owners is called Full coverage.

Car rent
I have little experience in this area, so everything that I will write next is the result of my research on this market at the moment, perhaps I missed something.
As in other developed countries, in the USA there are many brands of rental companies, which are actually owned by a much smaller number of corporations (for example, Alamo and Enterprise are one company). There may be local rental companies operating only in one city/region, but I did not find them, and since they are not represented at airports, I did not consider them.
There are two ways to book a car rental: directly on the website of a particular company, or through an aggregator (they are also called brokers). Unlike the hotel market, where in 90% of cases you don’t need to look at anything other than booking.com, because the prices there are not higher than directly, and the choice is the largest, the car rental market is structured somehow *differently*. I saw that on the websites rentalcars.com and economycarrentals.com the price is significantly lower than directly in the Avis, Dollar and Budget offices. Often almost twice as low. But here a problem arose - on these sites, when I opened the full rental conditions, there was a requirement everywhere that the license should be issued at least 1 year ago, but in the rental conditions on the rental companies’ websites there was no such condition anywhere. But then, through one of the aggregators, I came across the rental company Alamo, and it turned out that their website directly is even a little cheaper than the aggregator’s, and there are no requirements for the license. Moreover, when booking there you not only don’t have to pay, you don’t even need credit card details. So I used Alamo all 4 times. In New Mexico they were only slightly cheaper than the aggregators, but in Hawaii they were almost half the price - $36 dollars per day versus $60+ in all other places.
As I understand it, Alamo has different prices for US residents and foreigners, and in favor of foreigners - I had CDW insurance included for free, which retails at the counter for more than $30 per day - like renting another car. SLI is not included and costs $10-15 per day.
The process of getting a car was simple - I give my card and license, they debit money from me, and give me a piece of paper with which I can drive through the barrier in the parking lot. They offer several cars to choose from, but in my opinion they are not particularly different. There are a bunch of other classes of cars that cost more, but I can't imagine why they are needed - even the cheapest cars in America are just huge compared to what I'm used to seeing. It might make sense to take a jeep to go off-road, but that was not my plan. But it seems that Americans can rent a jeep and just drive it on regular roads.
Unlike Europe, where when renting, it is customary to freeze the franchise cost of about several thousand euros on the card, in the USA there is no deposit at all. My card was authorized only for the amount that I had to pay for the rental, however, the authorization was up until the car was returned, so if I had returned it without a full tank of gas, they probably would have increased the transaction amount before writing it off. On aggregator websites, I saw a condition that a $200 deposit could be blocked.
All cars in the USA have an automatic transmission.
The main question is how much does the rent cost? In New Mexico about $25-30 per day, in the Hawaiian Islands - $35-40. The day is counted from noon to noon, on all sites you need to enter not only the date, but also the time of receipt and delivery of the car, and if you enter the return after noon, you will be charged as for half a day or for the whole day. I have experimentally studied the dependence of price on time, but not much. My experiments have shown that booking in advance is no cheaper, and sometimes even more expensive, than a week in advance. 1-2 days before the price seems to be the same as a week before. If you book for a long period of time, it becomes cheaper from day 6-7, before that the price for each subsequent day is the same.
As far as I know, in Europe rental costs from 20 euros per day, and sometimes in the off-season it can be from 10, on the other hand, this is the price without CDW insurance, but here it was included. With insurance in Europe it would be the same $30 per day a day or more.
When traveling by car, rent will be about 3/4 of your car expenses, and gas - 1/4. In New Mexico, I drove about 1,500 kilometers and spent only about $50 on gas and $162 on rent.

<b>Intercity public transport</b>
If you are traveling between major cities or just want to move to another region of the country without having to drive for five days in a row, you can use public transport: planes, buses, trains.
The most developed transport is aviation. In the USA, the number of domestic flights is enormous. There are three “classic” airlines in the United States: Delta, United and American Airlines, which also offer international flights not only within North America, but also to Europe and Asia. There are smaller companies like Southwest and Alaska airlines, which, despite the name, can operate flights to the other end of the country. And there are several low-cost airlines: Spirit, Allegiant, Frontier, jetBlue. This is in theory, but in practice, all American airlines are low-cost airlines in terms of service level. All companies charge luggage fees, and some, such as United and Spirit, also have draconian restrictions on the size of hand luggage, much like Pobeda. Some also charge money for check-in, for example, Allegiant requires you to pay even to print your boarding pass at home, and the only option for free check-in is through a mobile app.
In terms of price level, there are no low-cost airlines here at all: even on the cheapest ones like Spirit you can rarely find tickets cheaper than $50-70 one way, so you can’t expect freebies on the level of Ryanair.

Trains in America are more expensive than planes, so this option can be immediately discarded. There is one relatively high-speed Acela Express line: Boston - New York - Washington, but the fares there are simply astronomical, Switzerland and Norway are cheap in comparison.
There are still buses. Buses are represented by the Greyhound company, which travels throughout the country (there are even long-distance buses such as New York - New Orleans, which takes 40 hours), and several local companies, mainly on the Atlantic coast. Megabus is also present in Texas, Louisiana, Nevada and California, which is exactly where I need it. Flixbus also recently entered the American market, and started in reverse from the western part of the country. In sparsely populated states like Arizona or Wyoming, there is only Greyhound, and the prices there are high, and where Greyhound competes with Megabus, the prices are lower. But still there is no cheap fare, expect that every hour of travel will cost at least $7-10, as in Western Europe.
Buses in America are good, they all have sockets and the Internet, so even long trips are not particularly stressful. Locals complain about the passengers (allegedly mostly blacks, cattle and poor people), but I didn’t have any problems in this regard. Greyhound has a fairly open cabin, Megabus is more cramped, and Megabus buses are usually packed to capacity; Greyhound often has a lot of empty seats.

<b>Urban transport</b>
There is a myth that there is no public transportation in the United States. Almost all white Americans are convinced of this, but in fact there is public transport in the USA, and in terms of the level of development it is transport of the first world rather than the third, while for tourists it is cheaper than in most European countries. While in Russia (not in Moscow, but in Russia) people travel on poor minibuses and buses from thirty years ago with incomprehensible schedules and payment to the driver in cash, in America the buses and trams are modern, the routes can be figured out from the information at the stops, tickets sold in vending machines.
One problem is that many years of propaganda have convinced many people that public transport is for suckers and losers. Of course, if you live in a suburb of Houston, 30 kilometers from the center, and want to go to visit your friend, who lives in another suburb of Houston, 40 kilometers from you, then such a trip by bus will take a long time. But in New Moscow or villages 40 kilometers from Berlin, buses also do not run every five minutes, so there is no news in this. If you are a tourist and you are interested in the sights of the city, then you can get to them everywhere by public transport; relative to a car, it will be 30% slower, but five to ten times cheaper. For example, in San Diego, an all-day ticket for all types of transport costs $5. Renting a car plus gas will cost about 40 dollars, so even with four people it’s much more expensive. And this does not take into account parking, and in a big city, if you go to attractions, then parking may be paid and expensive, and finding it will take time, which will kill your speed advantage over the bus.
Most large cities have either a metro or a network of modern trams. The fare is usually around $2-2.5; in some cities where public transport is less developed, prices are reduced to $1 to attract customers. In almost all cities you can buy a day pass, which costs about the same as two single tickets ($2 in Santa Fe to $7 in Los Angeles), which is obviously a good deal. The exceptions are New York and Seattle, where you have to pay every time (in New York there is also a pass for a week).

<b>Accomodation</b>
With hotels in America, everything is not just bad, but very bad. Of all the countries I have been to, this is the most expensive in terms of housing, and accommodation itself will be the most important expense that determines the overall budget.
If you travel by car, then you have the opportunity to stay in motels. There are motels in all the not-so-microscopic towns along the way, and there are several large motel chains throughout the country. Typically, motels in small towns are located along the main street; in larger towns they can be located anywhere except the very center. There are no motels outside the cities, so if you are in some desert region, keep in mind that the next motel may be 100-200 kilometers away. A motel room costs approximately $40-50. It is VERY rare to find something cheaper, but not significantly, maybe $35. If you find yourself in a big city (not the level of Albuquerque, but the level of Los Angeles), or at least somewhat touristic place, then motels there will cost more than $70. For example, the city of Carlsbad, which is located on the edge of New Mexico, but next to Carlsbad Caverns, has the most expensive motels in this entire state, I specifically drove 150 km north to the next city so as not to pay $70.

In large cities, the cost of housing close to the center is growing exponentially. Apparently, such hotels are aimed at businessmen, since there are very few tourists in the USA (border guards are most surprised when you say that you are a tourist; in their reality, everyone comes to the USA either to find work or to visit relatives who have already found work) . Accordingly, prices there go over $100; somewhere in central New York it’s common to ask for $150 for a room of 5 square meters with bedbugs as a bonus. There are two options to avoid going broke in this situation: hostels and airbnb.
There are hostels in all major cities, but of course there are few of them. In Russia, in a city of 200 thousand inhabitants there will be 10 hostels; in America, in a city of several million there may be 2-3. Prices vary greatly - somewhere the price can start at $20 or even a little lower, but somewhere there is no competition and you will have to pay up to $50 for a bed, which is simply monstrous. Examples of cities where hostels are not super expensive: Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami. Examples of cities where everything is bad: Seattle, Portland, Boston.
The situation here is gradually changing, I went through booking.com and found out, for example, that in the city of Philadelphia, where in 2013 there was only one hostel for $50, now there are two and the market has reduced the price to $25-30. There are a lot of hostels in Los Angeles and prices have dropped; in 2014 I paid under $30 and had a choice of three or four places.
Airbnb works well in lower-tier cities like Atlanta or St. Louis. You can find decent rooms for about $30. It is quite possible to find something in good accessibility from public transport. In first-tier cities there may still be difficulties, for example, in the same damned Seattle you can only spend the night for $50 on the floor in some Buddhist temple (seriously, the only offer there was!).

The state of Hawaii is especially worth noting. Some islands there are the most expensive place to travel on the entire planet Earth. As it turned out, even in Bora Bora you can rent a room for less than $100 a day, and on the island of Maui there is nothing at all cheaper than $200, except for a lousy hostel for $70 (yes, per bed, not per room), which is also the most expensive in the Universe. On the island of Kauai, housing is also well over $200, except for one hostel for $50/bed and one motel near the airport for $150. The main island of Oahu is a little cheaper, but the Big Island is budget-friendly - I rented a room on airbnb for $35.


<b>Food</b>
Food is very expensive, even compared to Europe. In addition, American tastes are approximately diametrically opposed to mine, so that there are entire shelves filled with peanut butter, which I hate, and locally produced cheese that reminded me most of cheese product diluted with laundry soap.
Since fresh vegetables and fruits are terribly expensive, in America I eat exclusively meat, sometimes adding a side dish if I’m not too lazy to cook it (if you live in a hostel, this can be a problem due to the large number of people who want to use the stove). Meat (beef, pork) costs normally and the quality is also excellent. When cooking on my own, I could easily spend $10 a day on food or less.
I note that I wrote once before that there are very few grocery stores in the USA, and having traveled by car, I do not refuse these words. There are really VERY FEW of them. For example, on the island of Hawaii I lived in a large cottage community with thousands of residents, and there was not a single store there; the nearest one in the neighboring town was 10 minutes away by car. There were only 2 stores in that town (the second one was further away, a 15-minute drive). And I lived close to the city, and if you go south to the coast, there are a bunch of settlements, from which the nearest supermarket is a 30-40 minute drive. And these are not remote villages with 100 inhabitants. In the city of Alamogorodo (New Mexico, 30 thousand population) there are three supermarkets, in the smaller Kozelsk of the Kaluga region there are 15.
Eating out is expensive. The most budget options are fast foods like McDonald's. Their prices vary greatly depending on the state. In Louisiana, a standard lunch with a Big Mac costs $5.15, the same set in neighboring Texas cost $6.30, in California it’s closer to $9, and in Hawaii it’s more than $10.
There is also Mexican and Chinese fast food. The most common Mexican chain is Taco Bell (of course, the food there is somewhat adapted compared to Mexico, but the essence remains the same), it is on average cheaper than McDonald's - there are combo meals for $5-7 where Mac costs $7-9.

A meal in a Chinese establishment will cost 8-10 dollars.
A business lunch for office workers from trucks costs the same amount (Minneapolis in the photo).

In a “non-fast food” restaurant, one dish will start at $15.

<b>Safety</b>
America is a country of scaredy cats. If usually reviews on sites like booking.com need to be divided by two (or it’s better not to read them at all), then in the case of America they should be divided by ten. About almost all the places where I lived, reviews were in the spirit of “This is a den where drug addicts and homeless people lie in stacks” or “Don’t go to this area even during the day, they will kill you there.” Translated from American into Russian, “dangerous area” means “I was driving through this area, and two blacks were walking along the sidewalk. Nightmare! I’ll never go there again.”
What can I say. By Russian standards, none of the places I have been in the USA can be called dangerous or even creepy. At most, unpleasant, like the corner of a house where homeless people hang out. So, when you hear phrases like “St. Louis Cemetery #1 should only be visited with a tour group” or “Central City became notorious for shockingly high rates of violent crime, as rival gangs and drug dealers exchanged gunfire in the streets”, disregard.

<b>Attractions</b>
I wrote a lot about various sights in stories about specific cities. In general, cities in America, of course, are not for everyone - this is not Europe, where there are all sorts of medieval streets and fortresses, but personally, it was interesting for me to spend at least a couple of days in every major city.
Natural attractions are numerous, and since they are often far from cities, they are difficult to access without a car. Of the most famous places, only Niagara Falls, located in the center of the city of the same name, are easily accessible. You can go to the Grand Canyon on a budget excursion from Las Vegas (I paid $80), and an excursion to the Everglades Park from Miami is also inexpensive. You can get to Yosemite from San Francisco by public transport, although it’s quite tedious. In other places, excursions are too expensive, especially in the Hawaiian Islands - you have to drive yourself.
To visit national parks, an annual pass costs $80 and allows you to visit parks throughout the country, including Hawaii. Considering that entrance to each park separately costs $15-30, this turns out to be a great deal. Some famous sites (such as Antelope Canyon) are not covered by this pass and must be purchased separately.
Entry fees are charged per car, regardless of how many passengers are in it. There are separate cheaper tickets for pedestrians and cyclists if you manage to get to the entrance without a car.
Tourist reservations such as beach and ski resorts in the USA are simply astronomically expensive. If you want to be horrified, Google how much lodging and lifts cost at some resort in the Rocky Mountains whose name you've never heard before. Spoiler: even if you live 100 km from there and can get there by car, it will still be MUCH cheaper for you to fly to Austria or France.

<b>Total</b>
In terms of money, the budget actually depends entirely on the price of housing, which varies greatly in different parts of the country. When traveling by car on the mainland, the budget will be approximately $100 per day - $40 for the car + gas, $40-50 for a motel away from the main cities and $10-15 for food.

In Hawaii, I got about the same on average, but that's because I stayed in hostels; non-hostels along the same route would have been at least twice as expensive.

If you travel around cities, then you can spend less money - $10 for food is quite possible if you cook it yourself, travel around the city will definitely be less than $10, and housing in some places can cost $20 for a hostel or $30 for an airbnb (or maybe maybe $50 for a hostel). Plus intercity transport.

With my last trip, I completed the gestalt of road trips, so now I know exactly what it’s like to travel around the USA on both sides. In terms of cities, I practically made the most of it; I’ve been to almost all large and significant cities. Probably, it is potentially possible to travel to national parks in the Colorado-Utah-Wyoming-Montana region, or in Alaska.
