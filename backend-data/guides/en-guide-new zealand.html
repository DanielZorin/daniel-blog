New Zealand is a country where I have long dreamed of going (and even before that I had not even dreamed of). This is the farthest country from the western part of Russia, unless you count countries that are smaller in size than Moscow.
It's time to tell everything about the country of kiwis and hobbits!

<b>Visa</b>
The New Zealand visa is electronic and is not affixed to your passport. You submit documents via the Internet, but after submitting you need to go to the visa center (in Moscow - on Suschevsky Val near the Maryina Roshcha metro station) and hand over... a photocopy of the passport pages. A few months ago they took the original passport, and after a couple of days they returned it, but now they don’t take it, you just need to give a photocopy and pay a service fee of more than 1000 rubles for it. It’s good that the visa itself is free, like the visa to Japan.
Standard documents - application form, work certificate, payment slips, travel plan in free form. The only strange place in the questionnaire is when they ask whether military service is compulsory in your country. If you answer “yes”, it will ask you to upload a document about the completion of this very service, so you just need to answer “no”.
I got a single-entry visa with a period of stay of 30 days and a corridor ending one month after the end date of the trip I specified. I didn't need a multiple entry visa. Obtaining the visa took almost a month, which was in line with the average waiting times indicated on the website.

<b>Money</b>
New Zealand dollars (NZD) are almost equal to Australian dollars and are 0.7 of US dollars. The denomintations are the same as in Australia: bills 5, 10, 20, 50, and coins 2, 1, 0.50, 0.20, 0.10. I immediately withdrew $1,000 from an ATM and spent less than half, since housing and transportation were paid for in advance. The ATM fee was 3 NZD.

<b>Accomodation</b>
Airbnb, airbnb and airbnb again. The price-quality ratio here is head and shoulders above the alternatives - the standard of living in New Zealand is high, as I saw with my own eyes while staying in the houses of local residents. The average housing expense was $25 per day, with a range of $15 to $40. I lived in a hostel only in one city - in Queenstown, because it is a very touristic place, where there are only 10 thousand residents and twice as many tourists, almost all the buildings are hotels. A place in a hostel costs about $15-20, a private room in a cheap hotel or motel costs $35-50, but on airbnb the rooms are much more comfortable, and there is a kitchen.

<b>Transport</b>
A few years ago, public transport in New Zealand was effectively monopolized by Intercity. Before that, there were several bus companies, including, surprisingly, a clone of the Polish PolskiBus and the Finnish OnniBus with exactly the same website design and prices starting from $1. Currently, all tickets are purchased through the InterCity website, although on some tourist routes de facto buses operate under other brands (Great Sights or Awesome.nz).
There are regular buses between the main cities on both the North and South Islands, approximately 1-3 times a day. The price depends on the time of purchase: if you buy a ticket for tomorrow, it will cost about $7 per hour of travel, and if you buy a month in advance, it will be half the price, but not below a certain level. That is, a ticket that costs $50 is sold in advance for $25 (and there should be several tickets for $1, but I didn’t come across this), and a ticket for $15 in advance will cost about $12. Therefore, a travel pass is useful for short trips, which will be discussed now.
There are two types of travel passes - with a fixed route and with a fixed time. A travel pass with a fixed time gives you a certain number of hours - from 15 to 80 in increments of 5. With these “hours” you can buy bus tickets using a simple formula: the bus travel time according to the schedule is the “cost”. That is, a 15-hour pass can buy five tickets for three-hour trips or 15 tickets for one-hour trips. These passes cost about 8 NZD/hour, the more the cheaper, but the price drops quite slowly and does not go below 7 NZD/hour. This means that buying a ticket a month before the trip at half price is cheaper than using a pass, especially for long journeys. But this all applies to regular routes; there are no cheap prices for tourist destinations, and this is where passes are very useful. Tourist lines include: a trip to Milford Sound from Queenstown with a cruise, a trip to the Bay of Islands from Auckland with a cruise, a trip to the Fox and Franz Josef Glaciers, a trip to Waitomo Caves and/or Hobbiton scenery, a trip to Aoraki-Mount Cook National Park. All these routes are not cheap, about 100-150 NZD each.
Fixed Itinerary Passes include access to select famous attractions. There are quite a few options on both islands, and even a super pass throughout the country. It is cheaper than taking separately if there are tourist lines on the route.
I ended up doing this:
- Fixed Route Pass Christchurch - Train to Greymouth - Franz Josef Glacier - Queenstown - Milford Sound
- A 15-hour pass, for which I bought a trip to the Bay of Islands and three short journeys of 1.5 hours each (Dunedin-Oamaru-Dunedin, Taupo-Rotorua)
- Separately, I bought tickets Queenstown-Dunedin, Wellington-Taupo, Rotorua-Auckland at half price.
- Separately, from another company I bought a round-trip transfer from Taupo to Tongariro National Park - 70 NZD.

In the South Island, the weather hampered me - heavy rains closed the road along the west coast and the train to Greymouth. At first I rescheduled all the travel on the pass to one day later, but when the situation did not resolve the next day, I had to cancel everything and buy a new pass on the Christchurch - Mt Cook - Queenstown - Milford Sound route, which cost about $100 less. All passes, fortunately, are refundable minus a booking fee of a couple of dollars. Tickets purchased separately are non-refundable (unless you buy them at the full expensive fare), but if anything, they can still be transferred to another date by paying the difference in price.
Flights are cheap within New Zealand; a Dunedin-Wellington ticket cost only $30. There are a ton of low-cost airlines flying between Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, Queenstown and Dunedin.
In general, in New Zealand without a car, I did not feel disadvantaged; all interesting places can be reached; travel prices are reasonable, lower than many European countries.

Urban transport in New Zealand is quite well developed; in all major cities buses run at least once every 30 minutes, in Auckland and Wellington - once every 10-15 minutes. Auckland and Wellington have commuter train systems that share the same fare schedule as buses.
In Christchurch, the day I arrived was Memorial Day for the victims of the terrorist attack, and transport was free for everyone.
In Dunedin, a bus ride cost me 3.40 NZD (two zones). The airport is far from the city, there are no buses there (except Intercity once a day on the way to Queenstown). You can order a group transfer for 20 NZD, a minibus came right to my address.
In Wellington, I bought a day pass for 10 NZD (for three zones, but the airport is in the third zone). The pass is sold from the driver. One trip through two zones for cash costs 4 NZD.
There are buses only 2-3 times a day in Taupo - it's a small town. I still managed to catch one of them after the trek to Tongariro. Price 2 NZD.
In Auckland I bought a local AT HOP pass. This seems to be the first place I know of where the deposit for the card cannot be returned, and the deposit there is as much as 10 NZD. But I thought it was still cheaper than paying in cash. According to the map, a trip costs almost 2 NZD for one zone, 3.50 for two, 5 for three (there are generally more zones, but you are unlikely to go further than the third zone, where the airport is). I lived in the second zone, but if you walked 10 minutes, you could get to the first and save a little; at the same time, the trip to the airport was cheaper for me, since the fare from the second zone to the third to the airport was 3.50. For cash, one zone costs 3.50, two zones - 5.50, three zones - 7.50, and transfers are not free, so from the center to the airport you will have to pay first 7.50 for the train, and then another 3.50 for the bus.

<b>Food</b>
Food in New Zealand is not cheap (even compared to Australia). I didn't save much, so even with cooking at home it came out to $12/day. I shopped mainly at Countdown supermarkets (the most common) or Park'n'save (the cheapest chain, with stores that look like warehouses). The price difference is quite small, so I usually wouldn't bother going to the more distant Park'n'save.
In New Zealand, lamb meat (lamb) is very tasty; in any store you can buy already marinated pieces with a sweetish sauce. The price is about 13-25 NZD per kilogram (depending on what part of the lamb). At the same time, chicken costs slightly less, so I most often took more “elite” meat.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-new zealand-699452_original.jpg" title=""/>
A combo with a Big Mac at McDonald's costs 10 NZD, a combo with a quadruple Big Mac costs 12.60 NZD. A three-wing combo at KFC costs 6.20 NZD.
In general, prices in restaurants are approximately the same as in Western Europe, if you do not forget that 10 NZD is only 6 euros. So, shawarma in a stall costs about 10 NZD, eating in a Chinese canteen costs 10-12 NZD. A business lunch costs 15-20 NZD, same as most meat dishes on the menu.

<b>Internet</b>
I used DreamSim, the price is 10 euros/gigabyte, the same as in Europe. For local operators, a 1 GB package costs 15-20 NZD, so if used sparingly, DreamSim is clearly cheaper.

<b>Attractions</b>
Unlike neighboring Australia, where kangaroos gallop 5 km outside the city limits and crocodiles even swim somewhere, New Zealand is almost completely developed by humans. At the time of the appearance of the first people around 1300 (New Zealand is the last place on Earth inhabited by people), almost the entire archipelago was covered with forests, and by the arrival of Europeans at the end of the 18th century, less than half of the forests remained, and the Maori also exterminated the only large animal - moa birds. Now 80% of the territory is fields and pastures. As you drive along the road, sheep and cows alternate along it. So, to meet a kiwi bird in the wild, you will have to go into the wilds.

The largest untouched area is Fiordland National Park in the southwest of the South Island, this place really looks like Jurassic Park, only without dinosaurs, but with ferns. By the way, the Jurassic period is hardly even a joke, because it was the last period before New Zealand broke away from Australia 85 million years ago, and since then it has been isolated from the rest of the lands.

In general, the west coast of the South Island is quite wild and sparsely populated, sandwiched between the mountains and the sea. An even larger protected area surrounds the volcanoes in the center of the North Island.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-new zealand-699036_original.jpg" title=""/>
The northern part of the South Island, in the area of ​​the Abel Tasman National Park, should also be good - this is the only region where I did not go.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-new zealand-698824_original.jpg" title=""/>

New Zealand has very good conditions for long trekking. Across the country there are <a href="https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-stay/stay-in-a-hut/">almost 1000 huts</a> for overnight stays on the treks, an overnight stay usually costs only 5 NZD (or you can buy unlimited for six months for 92 NZD).

From an architectural point of view, the South Island is more interesting - colonization began there, since there were fewer conflicts with the indigenous population. The cities of Christchurch, Oamaru and Dunedin look like good old England, even in residential areas you can find Victorian mansions and Gothic cathedrals.

<b>Results</b>
In 17 days/16 nights, I spent $1,157 - just under $70 per day. All travel cost $450, of which about $300 was for three excursions (Mount Cook, Milford Sound and Bay of Islands). Accommodation cost about 400 dollars (25 per day), food - about 200 ($12 per day). Another $50 was spent on travel around the cities and the only entrance ticket to the Valley of Geysers in Rotorua was $40.

As a result, it turns out that it’s not that expensive to go to New Zealand. Traveling through France or Germany with a route of similar length, I would have spent significantly more money on travel and accommodation, but would have spent a little less on food. A trip to the US would be more expensive even factoring in the more expensive flight to New Zealand. So don’t be afraid, a two-week trip can easily fit under $2000 with flights from Europe.
Will I return to New Zealand? Someday, probably yes, there is still the western coast left, you can go on a long hike. But it's probably not a high priority at the moment.
