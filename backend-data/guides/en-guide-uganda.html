After Ethiopia, I flew south to East Africa, to the Great Lakes region. There are three small countries there, far from the sea: Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi. Uganda was a British colony, and Rwanda and Burundi were Belgian, so they speak French there, but English is also quite common, probably because there is more interaction with neighboring English-speaking countries than with Congo to the east.

<b>Visa</b>
You can get a visa to all three countries at the border.
Burundi: $40 for a three-day visa or $90 for a one-month visa. At the land border, they only issue a three-day visa, which can then be extended. The visa is pasted into the passport (at least at the airport).
Rwanda: the visa costs $50
Uganda: the visa costs $50
There is also a special East Africa Tourist Visa. It costs $100 and allows you to visit Uganda, Rwanda and Kenya. It seems that you cannot travel to other countries, otherwise the visa will be cancelled, and you can move between these three as much as you like within 90 days. Separately, these visas cost $130, so there is a saving of money, plus saving space in the passport. This visa must be obtained through the country you enter first, in my case it was Rwanda. It is easiest to obtain through Rwanda - just fill out the form, no reservations are required (for example, to Kenya), I received the visa a couple of days after applying.

Here I made a shameful mistake - I didn't know that Burundi has a black market for currency, and I exchanged $50 at the official rate of 2800.

<b>Transport</b>
I traveled on whatever I could. The best thing was from Kigali to Kampala - I took a big bus, which had comfortable seats, sockets and even Wi-Fi (in Uganda). And it didn't even break down, although we traveled all day (from 9 am to 9 pm). The most painful part was at the end, but it wasn't the bus's problem, it was Kampala's problem - the traffic jams in this city are just incredibly bad. So we dragged ourselves for three hours the last 50 kilometers, and the next day I drove from Kampala towards Jinja for the same three hours.
If you are going more locally, then in Uganda you can use regular African minibuses, I have already gotten used to them.

In Rwanda, as I understand, they mostly use medium-sized buses. It was definitely nicer to ride in it than in a minibus, especially by the window, I enjoyed the gorgeous landscapes the whole way. The main disadvantage is that the bus stopped in every village at every pole, because of this the 150-kilometer journey took more than six hours. I'm not sure if there are express buses in Rwanda. At least I didn't see any on the way from the Tanzanian border.

I crossed Burundi right through. At first I rode on a regular bus, it was of course completely full, so I sat on a folding seat in the aisle. The ride was actually quite good, unlike Rwanda, there were almost no stops, only once for the toilet for 100 km of the journey. But we moved quite slowly, because the engine had difficulty pulling uphill, and the road was mountainous.

After Gitega, I switched to a shared taxi, and things went faster, I even started taking pictures of the landscapes from the window. <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945969611_21b8b5b6a2_o.jpg" title=""/>
Why is the route so strange at first glance: the fact is that the border between Rwanda and Burundi has been closed for more than half a year, because the government of Burundi was offended. And I only found out about this a couple of days before arriving in Burundi. So I had to improvise and go around through Tanzania. On the one hand, such a detour took a lot of time, and I had to hurry. On the other hand, I saw a lot of beautiful landscapes and rural life, drove through little-known exotic places, and it seems to me that when traveling in Africa, this is more valuable than visiting a specific city.

Prices for travel:
Bujumbura - Gitega: 20,000 francs ($3.5)
Gitega - Muyinga: 20,000 francs
Muyinga - Tanzanian border: 50,000 francs by taxi
border - Ngara: 30,000 shillings by motorcycle taxi ($11)
Ngara - Rwandan border: 30,000 shillings by motorcycle taxi (>30 kilometers)
border - Kigali: 5,000 francs ($4)
Kigali - Kampala: 25,000 francs ($20)
Kampala - Jinja: 10,000 shillings ($3)
Jinja - Kenyan border: 15,000 shillings ($5)

Within the cities, I traveled mainly by motorcycle taxi. This is especially true in Kampala, where there are terrible traffic jams. The local taxi app Safe Boda generally only offers motorcycle taxis. The ride costs 2000-3000 shillings ($0.55-0.80), you can also just flag down a motorcycle taxi on the street and bargain for 3000. In Jinja, the app doesn't work, but I bargained and rode like that. In Kampala, there is also Uber, which costs five times more than a motorcycle taxi. In Rwanda, I tried using the Yego app, but no one ever showed up. I caught motorcycle taxis by hand, and the rides cost 1000 francs (it can be cheaper through the app).
Burundi is such a poor country that there are no motorcycle taxis, only regular taxis, which are expensive (or maybe I'm not good enough at bargaining in French). I had to pay more than $10 from the airport.

<b>Accommodation</b>
Accommodation is generally easy to find on the spot, there are many hotels that are not in the booking systems. Especially in the area of ​​bus stations. In Rwanda, I booked in advance, closer to the center. I paid about $15-20 for a pretty good room in cheap-looking hotels. I didn't find any cheaper places in Kigali, Kampala and Jinja, only more expensive ones.

<b>Food</b>
The classic food in this region looks something like this:
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946444145_46aa50e4e2_o.jpg" title=""/>
On the left is something called "matoke". It's a puree made from a special kind of green banana, but it tastes like potato. On the right is some meat in a spicy soup/sauce. This whole meal cost about $2, which is a real budget option.
Bananas for matoke:

There are generally quite a few restaurants, so I often ate at the same inns where I stayed overnight. Usually, if you ask for food, the owner will bring fried chicken with potatoes, about 4-5 dollars:

Street food: huge kebabs in Uganda are sold near the road, and they cost only 2000 shillings ($0.60)

<b>Internet</b>
I bought SIM cards not in the offices of mobile operators, but from hands somewhere on the street near the border, so I paid for them a little more than they officially cost.
In Burundi it was in the center of Bujumbura, near the office there were people in operator uniform, everything was official, they registered it under my passport. I paid 13,000 francs (a little more than $2 at the black rate), for a SIM card + a couple of gigs.
In Rwanda, I bought a SIM card already registered to the seller at the border, so it was more expensive.
In Uganda, at the border they offered me an unregistered SIM card for 10,000 shillings ($3) or a registered one for 30,000. I took it for 10k, since there was Wi-Fi on the bus. The next day I tried to register it, but it turned out that it was already registered. Then I just bought an Internet package for 5,000 ($1.5)

<b>What to see</b>
Rwanda is a small mountainous country (it is not for nothing that it is called the country of a thousand hills) with very beautiful landscapes. Because of my route, I saw only the eastern half. In the western half, the most interesting thing is Lake Kivu, but there is a border with the DR Congo, where things are currently unsettled (they don't let you into the DR Congo itself from this border, although tourists used to go there, and you could get a visa remotely through invitations from the local national parks).

There are three national parks in Rwanda. The first is Volcanoes Park, where you can see mountain gorillas. It costs as much as $1,500, probably the most expensive entrance ticket in the world.
Akagera Park in the east is for safari, there are all the big five. Entrance costs $50, you can drive yourself if you rent a car. Accommodation in the park is expensive.
Nyungwe Park is in the south near the border with Burundi, if the border were open, I would drive there. It is a humid tropical forest, like in Southeast Asia. You can only go with a guide.

Kigali is a very civilized and picturesque city.

Burundi is a country very similar to Rwanda. Also has beautiful mountain landscapes. Even the local language is closely related to Rwandan, and there are Tutsi and Hutu here too, and there was a similar war. But the country has only recently begun to open up to tourism, and the infrastructure is still much smaller than in Rwanda.

Uganda is the largest country, and it has many national parks. Mountain gorillas live in Mgahinga and Bwindi National Parks on the border with Rwanda and the DR Congo, as well as in a neighboring park in Rwanda. In Uganda, seeing gorillas is a little cheaper - around $1000. 
There are also parks with large animals, the most famous are Queen Elizabeth and Murchison Falls. Safari in Uganda is quite budget-friendly compared to neighboring countries: entrance to these parks costs $40, a group safari is only $20-30. There is inexpensive housing. But getting to the parks themselves is relatively long, and the roads there can be not very good.

Kampala is a city with its own flavor, hilly and picturesque in places. But with very tough traffic jams. <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945984301_8d57c052db_o.jpg" title=""/>
Near Kampala is Entebbe, where you can chill on the shore of Lake Victoria (Kampala Airport is also located there).
Instead of Entebbe, you can go to Jinja - also on the shore of the lake (though it may not be so easy to get to the shore, but I managed).

<b>Expenses</b>
I spent very little money, mainly on visas and travel.

The countries are generally beautiful and quite interesting, Rwanda is really cozy and civilized.
