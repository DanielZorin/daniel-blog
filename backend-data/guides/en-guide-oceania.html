In 2019-2020, I traveled twice to Oceania, a remote and rarely visited part of the world. <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/535106.html">Australia</a> and <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/533372.html">New Zealand</a> have received separate reviews, and now I will try to systematize information about all other countries in the region. As in the case of <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/446698.html">Caribbean</a> earlier, only a personal visit here helped me finally remember all these countries, their relative positions, language groups and other trivia.

This map shows the countries I've been to: New Caledonia, Vanuatu, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, Cook Islands, French Polynesia, Northern Mariana Islands and Guam.

Oceania can be divided into three parts: Micronesia, Melanesia and Polynesia.

<b>Micronesia</b>
Micronesian languages ​​are spoken here, as well as English - almost all countries were or are US possessions.
<b>Guam</b> is a US possession, which, however, Russian citizens could enter without a visa until October 2019. Now only with a US visa. There are cheap flights from South Korea, Japan and Hong Kong (from $100).
<b>Northern Mariana Islands</b> are also a possession of the United States, and the US visa is also required. You can fly to the main island, Saipan, from Guam or from South Korea for $100-150.
<b>Palau</b> is one of the top diving destinations. It is closer to the Philippines and Indonesia, but there are flights here only from Guam, Seoul and Taipei.
<b>Federated States of Micronesia</b> is a large country (if you count the distance between the islands). There are the Yap Islands, where people collect giant stone coins, and the ruins of an ancient city on the island of Pohnpei.
<b>Marshall Islands</b> - here the Americans tested atomic bombs.
All of the above countries are connected by flights of the American airline United. It has the famous flight Honolulu - Majuro (capital of the Marshalls) - Kwajalein (US military base) - Pohnpei - Chuuk (Micronesia) - Guam. They fly to Palau from Guam. All of these flights are incredibly expensive (from $400), but if you can get United miles somewhere, you can buy them with almost zero fees. All that remains is to figure out where to actually get the miles.
<b>Nauru</b> are Russia's main friends in Oceania, they recognized the independence of South Ossetia and abolished visas for Russians. In the 90s, this country was in the top 10 in terms of GDP per capita due to phosphate mining on the island, but then they ran out, and now Nauru is in the bottom 10. The Australians have built a prison on the island where they deport illegal migrants, and the Nauruans make money because a visa for journalists who want to see this prison costs $10,000. You can get there from Australia (from $500), Marshall Islands ($300), Fiji ($700+)
<b>Kiribati</b> - this country is so elongated that the western part of it is considered part of Micronesia, and the eastern part is considered Polynesia, but it was inhabited by people from the western part, so culturally it is more or less united. The date line was shifted east by as many as two time zones so that everywhere in Kiribati it would be the same day. You need a visa, and it is quite complicated, but not like for the Solomon Islands. You can get it either tediously online through some travel agency, or in person in Honolulu, if you happen to be there. There are essentially two inhabited islands in Kiribati - Tarawa in the west and Kiritimati in the east, with thousands of kilometers of nothing between them. There are no direct flights between the two parts of the country, only via Fiji. From Tarawa there are flights to Micronesia - Nauru and the Marshall Islands, for 200-300 dollars. The Fiji-Honolulu flight flies to Kiritimati.

<b>Melanesia</b>
Melanesians are more similar to New Guineans than to Polynesians and Micronesians. Their languages ​​are from the Austronesian group, but bear little resemblance to each other (unlike Polynesian languages, which are mutually intelligible in places even on distant islands). Pidgins (mixes of local languages ​​with English) are also in use.
<b>Papua New Guinea</b> is one of the most closed and difficult countries to travel, it is very difficult to get a visa there, it is quite dangerous and uncivilized. There are flights to the capital for $200 from Australia, or you can enter by land from Indonesia. You still need to fly from the capital because it is not connected by roads to the rest of the country. Just the other day, news came out that Russian citizens were given either a visa on arrival or an electronic visa, but only upon arrival at the airport.
<b>Solomon Islands</b> is a country to the east of PNG; from Bougainville Island to the nearest Solomon Island you can almost swim. You need a visa, and this is the most problematic visa in Oceania among independent countries. They respond to letters very reluctantly, and there are no ways to get it quickly in person in neighboring countries. There are flights around $200 from Australia, Fiji.
<b>Fiji</b> is the most accessible country in Melanesia and the main transport hub of the region. Many flights to the neighboring countries of Melanesia and Polynesia are connected to Nadi Airport, in addition, there are direct flights here not only from Australia (from $100), but also from Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Los Angeles, which allows you to get to Oceania without an Australian visa .
<b>New Caledonia</b> is a possession of France, a fairly large island, visible on any map. You can fly relatively inexpensively from Australia (about $200) and from Vanuatu. There is also a direct flight to Tokyo ($400), which is not such a bad option for getting to Oceania from Europe compared to a detour through Australia, and does not require an Australian visa.
<b>Vanuatu</b> is a fairly affordable country, a ticket from Australia costs $150, and there are even cheaper flights to New Caledonia and Fiji.

<b>Polynesia</b>
The most extensive part of Oceania. Residents speak Polynesian languages, related to each other.
<b>New Zealand</b> is ethnographically Polynesia, if we talk about the indigenous Maori population. They sailed here from the Cook Islands.
<b>Tonga</b> is one of the most accessible countries in Oceania (together with Fiji and Samoa). Ticket from New Zealand from $120. The only monarchy in Oceania. In addition to the main island, there are also paradise and wild islands, but flights there are quite expensive.
<b>Samoa</b> is another accessible country in Oceania (together with Tonga and Fiji). Flights to Fiji and NZ are around $150, to Australia it's more expensive. It consists of two large islands, with a short distance between them.
<b>Tuvalu</b> is the smallest country in Oceania after Nauru. It's the only country that definitely cannot be visited for one day (which it deserves) since flights are less frequent. A ticket to Fiji (three times a week) is more than $200, to Kiribati around $300 (once a week).
<b>American Samoa</b> is a possession of the United States. Flights only from Samoa ($160 roundtrip), Honolulu ($500+) and Tonga ($400). The visa situation is murky - they do not accept US visas, you need to get permission directly from them. If you are not from a category A country, then a regular 30-day visa will not be available to you - there is a list of documents that is usually required when obtaining a residence permit somewhere in America, including a certificate of good conduct and a bunch of medical tests. There is a transit visa for 24 hours, for which, in theory, you only need a ticket. In 2019, they even made a website for applications, and someone on the Internet wrote that he easily received permission. I applied in November, in addition to the ticket, they required me to provide a certificate of vaccination against measles (there was an outbreak in Samoa at that time), I did it (the same form as for yellow fever), they wrote that they received it, and that’s it. They didn’t answer for a month, then they asked me to send the certificate again and fell silent forever. The application site also stopped working. As a result, I was never able to get into this country.
<b>French Polynesia</b> is a large country comprising several groups of islands on the eastern edge of Polynesia. The most famous islands are Tahiti (capital) and Bora Bora (VIP resort). You can get there from the USA from just $200 on United from San Francisco. There are flights from Paris for 600 euros one way, which can also be considered as an option. Within French Polynesia there are flights to many islands, but they all start at $200.
<b>Wallis and Futuna</b> - possession of France. There is connection only with Fiji ($200) and New Caledonia ($300).
<b>Tokelau</b> - three small islands, one of the most inaccessible countries in the world. Possession of New Zealand. There is no airport, you can only get there by not very regular cargo ships from Samoa. Oddly enough, a ticket to Tokelau is not that expensive - a few hundred dollars for the entire “cruise” (Pitcairn costs several thousand), but you need to budget time for Samoa in case the schedule changes. You also need permission to visit each of the three atolls, which can be obtained by separately writing to people from there, but they really don’t like to answer and work.
<b>Niue</b> is one small island, a possession of New Zealand. Trades the .nu domain. Flights only from Auckland, very expensive ($500 one way). A visa is not required, but since flights are only from Auckland, a multiple-entry NZ visa is de facto required.
<b>Cook Islands</b> - possession of New Zealand, visa-free. Flights from Auckland from $130 one way, from other countries it's more expensive - direct from Australia and Tahiti from $300.
<b>Pitcairn</b> is one small island farthest from the coast of Asia, a place with an amazing history. You can only get there by cargo ship from French Polynesia for several thousand dollars.
<b>The Hawaiian Islands</b> are an integral part of the USA, there are a lot of interesting things and a developed infrastructure. A flight from the West Coast costs $200 one way, and for about the same money you can fly Jetstar from Australia or Air Asia from Japan or Malaysia.
<b>Easter Island</b> is a possession of Chile, ethnically - the far edge of Polynesia. Famous for its characteristic sculptures. You can get there by regular flights from Chile, which is quite expensive ($400 round trip). There are also regular flights to Tahiti, much more expensive.

<b>Accomodation</b>
Housing on the islands of Oceania is not very good, but not nearly as bad as one would expect, and not as bad as it was 10 years ago. 10 years ago, on remote islands such as Nauru and Tuvalu, there was one hotel with prices of 150 dollars per day for a room worth $10. Now even in such places there are options on Airbnb for a much lower price (on Nauru there is only 1, but in Tuvalu there are 5!).
Locals don't really need hotels, since the island can be covered in a couple of hours. In countries with many islands, there may be cheap hotels on the main island - locals from distant provinces can come on business (as in the Maldives, there are a lot of cheap hotels on the main island). On the independent islands (where I was), housing is generally significantly cheaper than in the colonies. In terms of prices, I would put them in this order: Cook Islands &gt; Guam &gt; New Caledonia &gt; Tahiti &gt; Saipan &gt; Tonga &gt; Samoa &gt; Fiji &gt; Vanuatu. In Vanuatu I paid $20 for a nice hotel room with air conditioning. There was only one place in the Cook Islands for $55 a day on airbnb, everything else was much more expensive. In Samoa and Tonga it costs 30-35 dollars a day, in Tahiti I paid 50 (without air conditioning, but in the very center of the city).

<b>Transport</b>
Water transport can be found here and there if distances allow. For example, Fiji has ferries to Levuka and Vanua Levu; there is a ferry from Tongatapu to the neighboring island of Eua. There is no water transport between different countries (except for cargo ships to Tokelau and Pitcairn, where there are no airports), not counting cruises, which are also not very numerous in this part of the world.
On more or less large islands there is public transport, usually at decent prices.

New Caledonia has the most civilized bus network, they have a schedule that is followed! In the city of Noumea, buses run more or less frequently, at intervals of 20-40 minutes. You can get to the airport, but rarely and only during the day; in the evening I had to take a collective transfer for $20 (which is still much better than a taxi for $100+). A single trip costs 300 francs ($3), including to the airport. If you buy a travel card, then travel within the city will be cheaper, around 200 francs, but I didn’t see the point in this for myself.

There are a huge number of buses in Fiji (Viti Levu), including to small villages. Intercity buses run along the main roads. Payment is by prepaid cards, which can be purchased at stops, or small denominations are available from the driver. Tariffs are by zones that cover the entire island, one zone costs $0.5. The trip across half the island from Suva to Nadi cost me about $12 in total.

Vanuatu has a strange system with no directions. It’s just that there are a lot of minibuses driving around the city; if they are going approximately in the same direction that you need, then they will pick you up and take you to the point, even if this means making a small detour, turning into some residential area. Traveling around Port Vila costs 150 vatu ($1.5), further it is more expensive, and more importantly, it is more difficult to find a minibus that goes there.

In Samoa, all buses start from the capital. There are buses to all distant villages. Judging by how often I met buses, the interval to the farthest places in the west is about an hour, in the east, where the airport and ferry are, a maximum of half an hour or even less. Travel costs little, to the farthest end no more than 6 tala ($2.5), to the airport - 3 tala.

In Tonga, all buses start from the Nuku'alofa waterfront. There are buses to at least the following settlements: Niutoua, Kolonga, Lapaha/Mu'a (these are the same), Fatumu, Folaha, Houma, Hihifo. The frequency varies, to Lapaha it is frequent, in other directions there are 1-2 cars, so you can estimate the frequency accordingly. The fare is no more than 2 paanga ($1)

In Tahiti, the system is in the process of being improved to the level of New Caledonia. The buses are already decent, there are air conditioners everywhere and in some places even USB charging points. They have already installed columns with boxes for the schedule, but instead of a schedule there are signs saying “There will be a schedule here soon.” In fact, buses run from morning until 6 o’clock, often to the suburbs, across the entire island - approximately once an hour. On Saturday the service ends earlier; on Sunday there are no buses at all. Travel in the suburbs costs 200 francs (including to the airport), across the entire island - 400 francs.

In the Cook Islands (Rarotonga) there are two bus routes: around the island clockwise and counter-clockwise. They run every hour, one at :00 minutes, the other at :30. The fare is $5 (NZD), a day pass costs $16

There is virtually no public transport in Saipan.

In Guam there are government buses all over the island, but rarely, once every 2-3 hours, for $0.5-$1.5. And buses around the tourist area every 15-30 minutes for $4.

<b>Cars</b>
You can rent a car on all islands. It's quite expensive, this is not the Canary Islands, where a car costs 10 euros per day. Count on $50 per day minimum. Gasoline costs 1-1.5 dollars per liter. Driving in some countries is on the left (Fiji, Tonga, Samoa), in the French and American islands it is on the right.
The quality of roads in Tonga, Samoa, and Vanuatu leaves much to be desired. In Samoa, I drove at an average speed of 30 kilometers per hour, but if I really pushed it, I could have done 40.
International networks such as Avis, Hertz, etc. are present on the islands, there are also many local offices where prices are 1.5 times lower.
In New Caledonia, I wanted to rent a car, but I couldn’t do it, since everywhere they require a minimum of 2 years of experience from the date of obtaining a license. An international driver's license is also required. The cheapest I found was about 40 euros per day (in international offices around 60), while everywhere the mileage limit is 150 kilometers per day.
In Samoa, I rented a car from a local office I found in Apia (Dap Car rental). The price was 80 tala per day (30 dollars), in Avis the price was exactly one and a half times higher. I gave my passport as collateral, but there was no deposit on the credit card; in fact, it was not needed, because I paid in cash. Another 20 tala needs to be paid one-time for obtaining a temporary Samoan driver’s license (this is done by the rental office itself on the spot).
Somewhere on the road in Samoa (I'm sitting in a car waiting for my turn to cross this ford):

<b>Food</b>
Oceania is not the place to go for a variety of food. Although a couple of hundred years ago it had its own atmosphere - only here could one taste human meat, which in many countries they did not hesitate to eat. This is probably due to the small territory and rapid overpopulation, which also forced the Polynesians to sail further east in search of new lands.
Now in Oceania there is nothing special to catch in terms of cooking; cassava, yams and taro are grown locally, there is chicken and some fish. In independent countries, food is inexpensive, in American possessions it is the same as in the USA or more expensive.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945063052_e1a5685790_h.jpg"/>
The independent countries of Oceania all firmly occupy the first 10-15 places in the ranking of countries in terms of the number of people suffering from obesity. The reason, apparently, is bad food - high-calorie taro and other potato-like vegetables, a lot of fried food, and low-quality meat - all sorts of trimmings resulting from the production of Australian and New Zealand marble beef are brought there.
Judging by the prices in stores, it seemed to me that the most expensive island is New Caledonia, even more expensive than Tahiti. Chicken there cost $20 per kilogram with bones. The selection in the shops of the French colonies is European - you can buy baguettes, 50 types of cheese and 150 types of wine, to which an entire department is dedicated.

<b>Conclusion</b>
In total, I spent about a month on all the islands. The financial results can be summarized by saying that the cost of flying is much greater than anything else. Minimum expenses on site depend mainly on the cost of hotels.
In general, Oceania is a unique corner of the planet in its remoteness and isolation. The islands are beautiful, although there is nothing unique in terms of nature here. Entertainment such as diving or even just some excursions are absurdly expensive here, since they are designed exclusively for the very few very rich tourists who come here. For example, in Fiji, a trip to a beach island very close to Nadi to swim and snorkel off the shore costs 150 dollars; in Malaysia, a much more interesting trip with several spots costs no more than 10.
In two trips, it seems to me that I have squeezed almost everything out of this region; I don’t want to go there anymore. Other countries are mostly worth visiting just for the sake of visiting a remote place, but for this I still have all of Africa ahead of me. Well, Papua New Guinea is a must see someday, but here you need to choose a moment when you have the opportunity to go for a month in almost complete isolation from work and the Internet.
