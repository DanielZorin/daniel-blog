The eastern part of Africa can be roughly divided into two parts: the more tropical countries (Kenya, Tanzania...) in the south, and the more arid countries of the Horn of Africa, which are culturally somewhere between black Africa and the Arab world. Ethiopia is the key and most ancient country in this region. Ethiopia is also almost the main hub of Africa, since the local airline Ethiopian even flies to South America. Almost all the countries around Ethiopia are problematic - there is a war in Sudan now, Somalia and South Sudan are also not all that great. Eritrea is generally calm, but it is difficult to get a visa there. You can visit Djibouti, but it is not such an interesting country. In addition to Ethiopia, I decided to visit Somaliland - an unrecognized state that de facto separated from Somalia. Somaliland is relatively safe, and you can get a visa on arrival. <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946442150_a67870660d_o.png" title=""/>

<b>Visa</b>
The visa to Ethiopia is electronic, costs $82. On the website, you only need to fill out a form and attach a photo with a scan of your passport, no documents are needed. They sent me the visa the next business day, and it seems to be a standard situation. On the website, everywhere in the FAQ they write about arrival and the Addis Ababa airport, but in fact, with an electronic visa you can enter through the land border (which is what I did).
In Somaliland, you can get a visa upon arrival at the airport. There are doubts about the land border, so I planned to arrive directly in Hargeisa. Upon arrival, all foreigners there pay $60 for a stamp/entry, this is official and they give you a receipt. They had a long consultation about me, since I didn't have an invitation, and they said that I had to pay another $100 for a visa. I think that the border guards sawed up this money. On the other hand, if you get a visa at the embassy in Addis Ababa, Djibouti or Dubai, it costs either $80 or $100. And you still have to pay $60 at the border, at least all the other foreigners on my flight had visas and paid (there were Chinese, Egyptians, Iranians and Somalis with passports of European countries). 

<b>Money</b>
The currency of Ethiopia is called Birr. There is a black market in the country - the official rate is $1 = 57 Birr, and the unofficial rate is somewhere around 110-115, that is, the difference is very significant (just a few years ago the difference was 20 percent). Unlike other countries with a black market where I have been before (Argentina, Uzbekistan, Iran ...), in Ethiopia it is not so easy to change at the black rate, money changers do not sit openly, and it is not immediately clear where to look for them. This is how it happened to me. Having crossed the border, I thought to change 50 dollars to get to the city. But there were no money changers there, they advised me to go back to Somalia, since the money changers there were openly sitting behind the counters. I did so, explaining to the guards that I was only going to the money changer and back. Arriving in Jijiga, I asked the hotel manager where I could change another 100 dollars. He took me to the corner, where a man was sitting in a booth topping up mobile phone and payment system accounts. I called somewhere, made an agreement, and in the end they gave me birr at a rate of 110. Then in other cities, in hotels, they couldn’t tell me anything. In the end, in Adam, I asked a taxi driver where to change. He took me to a carpet store, and there he changed it himself, but the rate was already worse (although I only changed $50). Somehow, on $200, I traveled all over Ethiopia, and there was even about 500 birr left, which I couldn’t spend at the airport, since it turned out that they only accept dollars and euros there. According to current laws, upon entry, you must declare cash in the amount of more than $4,000 (usually the limit is 10k), and upon entry by land - more than $500. Customs officers at the Somali border, however, do not seem to be very knowledgeable about these laws, I spent a long time explaining to them that I needed a customs declaration and what it looked like, I lost a lot of time on this while they were filling out all this, putting stamps, etc. (they did not have forms, they typed everything from scratch in Word). In the end, no one checked anything at the airport upon departure.
The largest banknote is only 200 birr, there are also 100, 50, 10, 5.

In Somaliland, the currency is called shilling. The Somaliland shilling is separate from the Somali one. The rate at the moment is about 9000 shillings per dollar. The 1000 and 5000 shilling notes are in circulation, so they are more suitable for small purchases. In everyday life, cash dollars are accepted everywhere, I paid for a hotel, a bus, etc. in them. There are money changers on the streets where you can change 10-20 dollars for small expenses. Locals actively use transfers by phone number (just like in the country with the best banking in the world(TM) ), even beggars sit with a piece of paper with a donation number written on it.

<b>Transport</b>
In Somaliland, transport is buses/minibuses. Many guides say that you need to have armed guards or get permission from the police in Hargeisa to travel without guards. Other guides say that you don't need anything. I decided to try without bureaucracy, and my experience was positive. At least between Hargeisa and Berbera there were absolutely no problems. My passport was checked exactly once - at the checkpoint at the exit from Hargeisa, and the visa was fine with them. Further along the road there were several more checkpoints, but passengers were not checked there. On the road from Hargeisa to the Ethiopian border, my passport and visa were also checked a couple of times.
Fare: Hargeisa-Berbera $6, Hargeisa - Ethiopian border $6.
In Ethiopia, transport is the same cramped minibuses. There are also large buses, but these are for long distances. There are a lot of checkpoints on the roads from the Somali border to Dire Dawa, at many of which you have to get out of the minibus. But only at one near the border did they search people and rummage through my luggage, at all the others they search the minibus itself, and you just wait for it to arrive so you can get back in.

Fares:
Border - Jijiga by taxi: 3000 birr
Jijiga - Harar: 300 birr
Harar - Dire Dawa: 100 birr
Adama - Addis Ababa: 160 birr
Domestic flights are not cheap, for example to Dire Dawa more than $80. There are discounts if you fly to the country on Ethiopian. In addition, Ethiopia has passenger trains on one route: Addis Ababa - Adama - Dire Dawa - Djibouti. This railway is very important for Ethiopia, since the country has no access to the sea, and it needs the port of Djibouti (the only accessible port). The railway was built by the French (Djibouti was a French colony) more than 100 years ago, and was recently modernized by the Chinese. Passenger trains go for as many as two days: the first day from Addis Ababa to Dire Dawa, the second day from there to Djibouti. Departures are accordingly every other day. A ticket from Dire Dawa to Adama costs 1200 birr ($11) for foreigners, and half as much for locals. When I was traveling, the train was seven (!) hours late, apparently due to problems with electricity (we were just standing at stations for many hours). So I do not recommend using this train.

Within the cities, you can travel by tuk-tuk (they are called, as in Indonesia, "bajaj" - the name of the Indian manufacturer).
In Addis Ababa, you can call a taxi through the Ride or Zayride apps, they work intermittently (the driver may refuse to go). Nevertheless, I got to the airport for 350 birr ($3).
Addis Ababa has a metro (light rail) - two lines, completely separated from the rest of the traffic, mostly on overpasses. The metro was built by the Chinese about 10 years ago, and since then it has deteriorated. Due to a lack of money to repair the trains, at the moment only one line is actually working, and departures there are about once every 20-30 minutes, and not once every 5, as it should be on such a system. The crush in the cars is very strong. The fare is only 10 birr. Also 10 birr is the fare on city buses, which I used when I realized that it is better not to go into the metro. <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946291344_eaf3d4e33e_o.jpg" title=""/> 

<b>Accommodation</b>
I didn't book hotels in Ethiopia in advance, however, there are almost none on booking.com (except for Addis Ababa). I looked on the spot, fortunately the choice is quite extensive.
The cheapest hotels I saw cost around 600 birr. They are often combined with a restaurant or bar, and it is not immediately clear from the sign that this is also an inn. The conditions there are usually Spartan, and it can be noisy. In Adam, I spent the night in one, since after a 14-hour train ride and arriving late in the evening, I did not care where to stay. In Jijiga I also paid 700 Birr, but the hotel was more decent, probably cheap, since the city is not touristy. In Harar and Dire Dawa I paid more, 1400 and 2600 respectively ($12 and $23), but the room for this money was excellent, and in Dire Dawa it was a two-room suite. Cheap hotel:

Expensive hotel:

In Addis Ababa, I was looking for accommodation in the Piazza area, there are only cheap bad hotels there for 600-1000. In general, it is probably better to book something online in Addis, but I was lazy and wanted to live in the very center, so that's it. The richest area of ​​Addis Ababa, oddly enough, is near the airport - I saw it only from the window on the way to the airport, but it looks better than the central areas.
In Somaliland, I rented a good room in Hargeisa for $10 a day (Hotel Eid).

<b>Food</b>
Ethiopian food deserves attention, it's something unusual that I haven't tried before.
My personal favorite is definitely the "kitfo" dish - an analogue of the French tartare, only with hot spices. Definitely, if I see an Ethiopian restaurant in some country, I'll take kitfo without hesitation, it's very tasty.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946248253_7e8bb54603_o.jpg" title=""/>
If you fry pieces of kitfo, you get "tibs". Well, that's quite ordinary food.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946406495_6ff339180b_o.jpg" title=""/>
The national dish, however, is not kitfo, but "wat", or "doro wat" - something reminiscent of Indian curry in consistency. Spicy, but not too spicy.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945054202_1066b38132_o.jpg" title=""/>
Prices. This is a middling-poor restaurant in the Piazza area of ​​Addis Ababa. A kitfo-type dish costs 400-500 birr (this particular restaurant doesn't have kitfo).
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946216143_80cb5aab55_o.jpg" title=""/>
A more expensive hipster restaurant in the center of Addis Ababa, the prices are already serious. And this is still $8-10 at the black market rate, and at the official rate it would be like in Europe.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946216013_ec6e8cebed_o.jpg" title=""/>
I got a cheap dish "fetfet" here. Ethiopian dishes are usually served on this unusual sourdough bread called "injera" (or injera is given separately rolled into a tube). And fetfet is cut spirals from the same injera in sauce. That is, a salad with bread. 
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946413090_aec21dc44d_o.jpg" title=""/>
And this is the most budget option - I went to a cafe near the University of Addis Ababa, where students eat. Kitfo cost only 180 birr, half the price of a restaurant!
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946291024_8736859fc7_o.jpg" title=""/>
Ethiopia is also famous for its coffee (this is the birthplace of this drink). Ethiopian coffee will probably appeal to gourmets who like bitter freshly brewed coffee.

There is not much to eat in Somaliland, I stopped for a mango shake and scrambled eggs at some Yemeni eatery.
The main dish of Somalia and eastern Ethiopia (and Yemen on the other side of the strait) is a plant called "khat". Khat leaves contain the psychoactive substance cathinone. The most famous chemical relative of cathinone is 4-methyl-meth-cathinone, better known as mephedrone, the most popular drug in Russia. I have not tried mephedrone, so I can't compare. In my opinion, khat is similar to a weak version of cocaine. On the plus side, there is no withdrawal symptoms. On the minus side, you have to eat almost a whole broom (they eat only the leaves, and the small ones, which are closer to the stem) for it to work, so it's no wonder that the locals chew it little by little all day. A broom like this costs $2-3.

<b>Internet</b>
The Internet is cheap. In Somalia, at the airport, I paid $5 for a SIM card + a week of unlimited Internet.
In Ethiopia it is even less - 350 birr ($3) per SIM card + a week of unlimited data from Ethio Tel.
Ethiopia was unique for a long time in that it had only one mobile operator (usually even very small island countries have at least two). But a couple of years ago the market was liberalized, and a second operator, Safaricom, appeared.

<b>What to see</b>
There are many interesting places in Ethiopia, but there are some problems with traveling around the country at the moment. In 2020-2022, there was a war in the north in Tigray province (by the way, this is the bloodiest conflict of the 21st century so far). In 2023, a war began in Amhara province, mostly guerrilla, but this means that it is especially not recommended to travel by land, and the distances there are already large, and the roads are not very good. So I only visited the eastern part of Ethiopia and Somaliland.

Addis Ababa is the capital, a rather interesting city with various attractions. I visited a couple of Ethiopian churches (Ethiopia has a special branch of Eastern Christianity), went to the mountain, walked along the avenues. The city is much more developed and civilized than the rest of Ethiopia. The area near the airport looks especially advanced, which I only saw from the window on the way to the airport. <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945053752_9e15e64b8a_o.jpg" title=""/>
Adama is a large city south of Addis Ababa. They write that Addis residents go there on weekends. I did not find anything particularly interesting, the climate there is cool, but Addis Ababa is also cool.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945054362_6b8978b481_o.jpg" title=""/>
Dire Dawa is the second largest city in the country, which grew thanks to the railway. I took the train there.

Harar is a historic city listed as a World Heritage Site, a very colorful place, and a rare example of old architecture in Africa.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945085827_ef5573091c_o.jpg" title=""/>
Jijiga is the capital of the Ogaden province, where mainly Somalis live. The road to Harar is beautiful.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946247328_e6991d88ff_o.jpg" title=""/>
Hargeisa is the capital of Somaliland, there are no particular attractions, except for the MIG on a pedestal. But it is certainly colorful to get to Somalia.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946444735_9fd859ca9c_o.jpg" title=""/>
Berbera is the main port of Somaliland, there is some colonial architecture here.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945950416_6670471c2f_o.jpg" title=""/>

To the north of Addis Ababa are such interesting places as the rock churches of Lalibela, the historical cities of Axum, Gondar and Bahir Dar, as well as the Danakil Depression with the Erta Ale volcano, which even in the best of times could only be accessed with a guard.
To the south of Addis Ababa are hotter places, usually people go there to see exotic tribes or go on safari.
Outside of Somaliland, you can only get to Somalia with a tour and armed guards. Usually, those who like to visit all the countries of the world just fly to Mogadishu for a couple of days, but recently there have been more extensive programs that include Puntland - a region to the east of Somaliland (including the peninsula itself - "the horn"). In March 2024, Puntland refused to obey the federal government, so now it can also be considered a separate self-proclaimed country, like Somaliland. 

<b>Expenses</b>
I spent most of my money on visas. Otherwise, this is the cheapest trip, on par with Pakistan.
