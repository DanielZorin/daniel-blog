Myanmar is currently the least touristy country in Southeast Asia. Although it has been open to tourism for at least 20 years, previously a trip there was complicated by the high cost of air tickets and the virtual impossibility of visiting by land, as well as inflated prices specifically for tourists in dollars. Particularly scrupulous Europeans tried not to go there, so as not to support the junta that ruled until 2011 (and seriously influences life today). A lot has changed in recent years, civilization has begun to penetrate the country, and now Myanmar is not so mysterious, although there are still many myths and horror stories about it on the Internet.

<b>Visa</b>
A visa is required for Myanmar. You can get it online, but it costs $50 and you can only enter through the airport. A regular visa at the embassy costs $20. Most often it is obtained in Bangkok, because almost all roads to Myanmar go through Thailand. I got it in Laos. This has certain advantages: the price is $20, not 800 baht, for this money a visa is issued the next day (and in Bangkok after three days, and for issuing the next day you have to pay twice as much), there are few people. You don’t need any documents except an application form, a copy of your passport and photographs. The visa has a month entry corridor, you can stay in Myanmar for 28 days, which is more than enough.
A Bangkok-Yangon plane ticket on AirAsia costs $50-60 one way without luggage; if you buy it in advance, you can find it for $30, but in any case it’s cheaper overland - a total of $20. There are four land crossings between Myanmar and Thailand:
- In the very north of Thailand near Chiang Rai. This crossing is popular for visa runs, where you can go to Myanmar without a visa to a border town for 500 baht, but then you can only get to another small town, from where the road to the center of the country is closed for foreigners due to the alleged activity of separatists, you can only fly for $100+
- In the north of Thailand near Sukhothai (the city of Mae Sot). This is the most convenient and popular crossing. Last year, a 100-kilometer new road through the mountains was built from the border, reducing the journey to Yangon from 15 hours to 10.
- In the center of Thailand near Kanchanaburi. It is possible to drive deep into Myanmar, but it is more expensive, the road is bad, and you end up in the city of Dawei, from where it is also not close to decent places.
- In the south of Thailand in Ranong (extreme south of Myanmar). Also a popular crossing for visa runs, but useless for tourists, because the border town is barely connected to the rest of the country with dirt roads.
From China and India you can also enter by land, but these crossings are in such a bad place that you need special permits to get there, which are not cheap.

<b>Money</b>
The currency of Myanmar is called "kyat", although it is pronounced "chat". $1 ~ 1300 kyats at the end of January, and dropped to 1200 by mid-February. The best rate was near the border in a bank - I received 1286 kyats, while numerous money changers sitting at tables with piles of money offered a maximum of 1260, and some even said 1200. As in Thailand, large USD bills have a higher exchange rate.
Previously, foreigners had to pay for many things in cash in dollars (and even earlier there was even a special quasi-currency, like in Cuba), but this is no longer the case. You can pay for everything in kyat. Only in hotels, out of habit, the price is always quoted in dollars. Entrance fees to various attractions were also previously paid in dollars, but now they have been converted to kyat, and in many places at the rate of 1 to 1000, i.e. It is proposed to pay either 3000 kyats or $3 - it is clear which is  better. However, it is cheaper to pay in cash dollars for tickets to Bagan and Inle Lake, which are tied to an exchange rate that is not rounded in your favor (and you can also pay in cash in euros, which in this case is equivalent to the dollar).
There are already many ATMs in all cities. I have never used it, suspecting that the limits there are as low as in Laos and Vietnam.

<b>Language</b>
Burmese is available on Google translate, but cannot be downloaded for offline translation. I didn't learn to read.
Surprisingly, there is a lot of dubbing in English; it seems that now it is such a fashion to advertise yourself with an English phrase.

<b>Accomodation</b>
Hotel is the most serious problem in Myanmar. About 10 years ago everything was great - there were no tourists, rooms cost 3-5 dollars, for such a price one could forgive the poor quality. Now there are a lot of tourists in Myanmar (not as much as in Thailand, but noticeably a lot), and practically no new hotels have appeared, so prices have skyrocketed. Things seem to have started to improve in the last couple of years. After reading the guidebooks, I sadly counted on $20 a day for a hotel, but in reality it turned out on average somewhere around $13 (as in China), although there was almost a single cheap hotel in each city. If you go beyond the most popular tourist spots, things will get very bad. The fact is that foreigners are accommodated only in hotels that have the appropriate license, and in non-tourist cities most hotels do not have one. I was thrilled when, at the station hangout in Monywa, I was offered with a smile a shabby room with a cold village shower for $30 - this is the harsh reality of Myanmar. In practice, this means that there is nowhere to go in Myanmar beyond the places described below (however, there are not many attractions there, except for golden pagodas and mountains of garbage around).
The quality of housing for this money is lower than in Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. Many hotels don't even have hot water.
Some hotels serve European-style breakfast, apparently a legacy of colonial times. Fruit, coffee/tea, toast with butter and jam, scrambled eggs/omelet.

<i>Bad hotel in Yangon</i>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945064127_f18320acaa_h.jpg"/>
I will write in detail about each hotel, up-to-date information.
Mawlamyine, Nawarat Hotel. 12,000 kyat for a double room even with weak air conditioning. There is no hot water, no internet (maybe there is one at the reception, I haven’t checked). Located opposite the train station, close to the bus station. It's a 40-minute walk to the city center. One of the more or less decent places, definitely better than expensive hotels in the center.
Bago, San Francisco Hotel. 12,000 kyat (after bargaining), but it's not worth it. There is no hot water, it’s gloomy, dusty (like everything else in this city). There is no cheaper place in this city.
Yangon, Mahabandoola Guesthouse. 15,000 kyat ($12). There is no hot water, but there is Wi-fi. Very poor, but in Yangon everything else is much more expensive.
Mandalay, Garden Hotel. 15600 kyat ($12). The first room in which we managed to have a normal rest. There is hot water! Great view from the balcony, although you have to walk up to the sixth floor. There is internet, but it is unstable. Breakfast.
Monywa, Green Arrow Hotel. 25,000 kyat (after bargaining). This city is very, very bad in terms of affordable accommodation, but for $20 this hotel is okay, although not new or shiny. Hot water and air conditioning.
Bagan, Pann Cherry Guesthouse. 17,500 kyat ($14). There is hot water. The Internet, at the very least, too. In Bagan I expected the worst and was pleasantly surprised by the price.
Nyaung Shwe, Diamond Star Hotel. 19,000 kyat ($16), you can't find it cheaper. There is hot water and internet. There is breakfast.

<b>Transport</b>
Transport is not nearly as bad as I expected, but still leaves much to be desired.
Flights within Myanmar are expensive, dynamic pricing is not used, prices are fixed, and start somewhere around $100.
Trains are the cheapest transport. Until 2014, tickets were sold to foreigners only for dollars with a markup of approximately 20 times. Probably, there were no fools to pay such prices, so now the prices are the same for everyone. There are three classes - wooden benches, soft chairs and sleeping berths (not all trains have the latter). It’s comfortable to travel in soft seats, because the distances there are like in the business class of an airplane, but sleeping is not very good for two reasons: I’m used to sleeping in cramped buses, where I can rest my feet, and it’s really cold in the carriage, because not everyone closes their windows .
Trains shake, but buses shake more, so it's not a problem. But low speed discourages the desire to travel by train in many directions. Trains are almost twice as slow as buses, but their stations are in the city center.
Buses travel between any city and are very cheap. In Thailand I estimate one hour by bus (on a regular road, not a mountain one) for 50 baht ($1.5), and in Myanmar one hour will cost 600-1000 kyats. This applies to local buses; to get on them, you need to find a bus station. Everything is written there in Burmese, but people will tell you.
In tourist destinations such as Bagan and Inle Lake, bus tickets are sold at travel agencies and hotels, just like in Vietnam. The price is higher, although both times I took tickets for long distances, where buses are somewhat more comfortable than for short distances during the day. However, it is in these two places that there is not much choice - there you cannot come to the bus station and buy a ticket before departure, since there are 2-3 buses a day, and seats are limited.

Travel prices.
Myawaddy - Mawlamyine, shared taxi, 10,000 kyat (in Hpa An, however, they transferred us to a bus at no extra charge)
Mawlamyine - Bago, bus, 5500 kyat
Bago - Yangon, train, 600 kyat (lower class, but the conductor transferred the white misters to the highest)
Yangon - Mandalay, train, 9300 kyat (night train, seated car with soft seats. Hard seats are half the price, sleeping car - 12700, but there were no tickets for it)
Mandalay - Monywa, bus, 3000 kyat
Monywa - Bagan, bus, 2500 kyat
Bagan - Inle Lake, bus, 11,000 kyat
Inle Lake - Bago, bus, 14,000 kyat
Bago - Myawaddy, shared taxi, 15,000 kyat

Local transport is represented by minibuses converted from pickup trucks. Buses are available in Bago and Yangon, mostly decommissioned from Korea and Japan. The fare is very cheap - 200-300 kyat. You can also get to neighboring cities using such pickups, if you understand where they are coming from.
A taxi around the city is also very cheap, usually any trip on a tuk-tuk costs 1000 kyat (in Bangkok they won’t even discuss the amount). In Monywa we took a motorcycle taxi to the giant Buddha statue, it’s outside the city, the round trip is about 40 kilometers in total. The trip cost only 8,000 kyats ($6).
In Bagan, to explore the area, renting a bicycle costs 1,500 kyats per day, and an electric moped costs 6,000.

<b>Food</b>
The food is incredibly cheap. Even Thailand and Vietnam are put to shame - in Myanmar you can literally spend four dollars together in a restaurant, taking 5-6 dishes.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945963966_43c2a1119f_h.jpg"/>
There is no particularly famous national cuisine, but people in Myanmar know how to cook. I feel Chinese influence - many dishes had familiar spices. There are also authentic Chinese establishments where they speak Chinese (and at the same time cheaper than in China).
If the place is not very touristy, then noodles/rice with meat will cost 1500 kyats, in a tourist place - 2000, in the most expensive fashionable restaurant for white gentlemen - 4000. In Myanmar, I did not find a single establishment that seemed hellishly expensive to me ( Thailand is full of them, consider all restaurants too expensive for tourists).
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946301534_c9a34ad1d2_h.jpg"/>
Retail is not very well developed, although Yangon already has several reputable supermarkets. A nice feature of Myanmar is that, due to sanctions and international isolation, it has its own food industry, meaning not everything is imported from Thailand (unlike Laos). Among the local products, I would like to mention home-flavored chips and very tasty durian ice cream in a round mold for 250 kyat. But even imported goods, paradoxically, are cheaper than at home. For example, round OREO cookies, which are sold in Thailand in any store for 30 baht (if you look hard enough, for 28), in Myanmar they cost 800 kyat, that is, about 23 baht.
Shopping at the market is complicated by the fact that Myanmar is one of three countries (along with Liberia and <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/tag/usa">USA</a>) that do not use the system SI. It seems like they started the transition a couple of years ago, but all mechanical scales use traditional weight units, where one unit is approximately 1.6 kilograms. Sellers say the price either per kilo, or for this unit, or for half of it. You can't tell by looking at scales and weights without labels. Perhaps they sell a kilogram of tangerines to tourists for 1,000 kyats, and 1.6 kilograms to locals. In any case, fruit remains very cheap, at least a third cheaper than in Thailand. Strawberries are sold everywhere at 2,000 kyat for a decent portion (about half a kilo).

<b>Internet</b>
All hotels had Wi-Fi, and in all of them it worked very poorly. Remember the 90s, the times of dial-up - this is approximately the speed there. Especially upload speed is low. For example, uploading photos is almost impossible. In general, internet in hotels is only suitable for the most urgent needs.
If you need access with an acceptable speed, go to the office of local mobile operators to get a SIM card. Five years ago, a SIM card cost $2000 (TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS), but now it costs a little more than one. In 2013, in addition to the state-owned operator MPT, two new ones, organized by foreigners, appeared: Ooredoo and Telenor. Currently, the tariffs of all three operators are approximately the same: I paid 1,500 kyat for a card and 2,700 kyat for a package of 500 megabytes. MPT is relevant if you go far beyond the tourist areas, because the two new operators have not yet reached there, they have 2G coverage everywhere, but the 3G network is not the best. Ooredoo was the first to launch the network, and they only have 3G (they simply didn’t make 2G), but now Telenor has overtaken them in terms of coverage, so I took it. All the places I have been are covered by Telenor, including the internet worked well while traveling on buses and trains. The speed is good.
The whole country is plastered with advertisements of cellular operators; they are on every canteen in every remote village. You can buy a SIM card at any kiosk; no documents are needed.

<b>Entertainment</b>
In the main tourist places they charge foreigners more for entry, in the rest it is usually free.
Mawlamyine, "Golden Rock" - free, only for the ascent and descent by truck I paid 4500 (if it were full, it would have been 2000, but there were almost no locals). There is a more famous similar temple in Kyaiktiyo (closer to Yangon), there is also a truck ride up the mountain, but the entrance is $6, and getting there is more difficult and expensive.
Bago, a golden pagoda under restoration and covered with paper instead of gold - 10,000 kyat. I didn't go inside.
Yangon, golden pagoda, where all the tourists go - $8. As it is written in wikitravel, you cannot enter using someone else’s ticket. I did not go. Judging by the photographs, the main pagoda in Mawlamyine is about the same.
Mandalay, boat trip to the town of Mingun up the river - 5,000 round trip. There, entrance to the tourist part costs another 5,000, but it’s easy to get by along small streets away from the river.
Monywa, pink baroque pagoda - 3000 kyat. Admission to the Giant Buddha is free.

Bagan - $20. However, we got in for free. The ticket office is located on the highway leading from the bus and train stations to the city of Nyaung U, where all the hotels are. If you walk not along the highway, but first along a country road along the airport, then along the streets of a residential area, you can bypass the ticket office. The distance is about 6 kilometers. The ticket was not checked anywhere in Bagan.
Inle Lake - $10. They collected it on the bus at the entrance to Nyaungshwe. For some reason there is no information on the Internet on how to get around this. Perhaps if you take a local pickup from Taunggyi, you can get through. Or on foot, but it’s a detour of 8 kilometers.
Boat tour on Inle Lake - 20,000 per boat. Without entering Inthein it will be 15,000, but Inthein is the most important thing. It is easy to charter a boat by going to the pier in the morning.

<b>Results</b>
Expenses for 15 days amounted to $510, that is, $34 per day.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946422915_942e50e5f5_c.jpg"/>
The last three days have undermined the statistics, because I decided not to hang out at Inle Lake, but to immediately move to Thailand.

Thus, even taking into account more expensive housing, Myanmar turns out to be the cheapest country in Southeast Asia, although it is far from the most comfortable at similar costs. If you travel alone, it will be much cheaper, because a single room often costs half as much as a double (in other countries there is no such difference).

They often say that you need to go to Myanmar now, before it becomes will lose its authenticity. I don't agree with this. China has not ceased to be China just because there is a McDonald's on every corner, and trains run between cities at a speed of 300 kilometers per hour. At the moment, the main flavor of Myanmar is the huge mountains of garbage, like in India, with which all cities and even temples are littered, as well as bad roads. Previously, there was still a lack of mobile communications and extortionate prices in dollars, but this is already gone. If in five years the country has hotels and roads, and garbage dumps begin to be cleaned up, traveling around Myanmar will become much more pleasant. Prices will rise, but they still have room to rise before Thailand.
Nowadays traveling around Myanmar is interesting, but not very comfortable, and you can’t get tosome places.
