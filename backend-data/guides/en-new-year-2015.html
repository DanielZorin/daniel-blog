Actually, my year started on March 1, but it’s customary to sum up the results in December, so the statistics are ready.

This year I <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/363261.html">changed the format</a> and now I travel long term.
I visited <b>17 countries</b>, mostly in Asia, of which <b>10 were new</b>: <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/mongolia">Mongolia</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/abkhazia">Abkhazia</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/south%20korea">South Korea</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/philippines">Philippines</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/taiwan">Taiwan</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/vietnam">Vietnam</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/cambodia">Cambodia</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/thailand">Thailand</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/malaysia">Malaysia</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/laos">Laos</a>.

This is not the first time I have visited <b>7 countries</b>: <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/russia">Russia</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/germany">Germany</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/poland">Poland</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/slovakia">Slovakia</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/hungary">Hungary</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/china">China</a>, <a href="http://juan-sintierra.livejournal.com/tag/hong%20kong">Hong Kong</a>.
I stayed in <b>126 hotels</b>, and also spent 15 nights on the road (on Russian, Chinese and Mongolian trains, Philippine and Vietnamese buses, on an airplane and even in the lounge of Taipei Airport). The most expensive hotel was in Berlin for 39 euros; in Asia - in several Korean cities for 30,000 won and in Hong Kong for 240 HKD (about $30). The cheapest hotel was in Laos on the island of Don Det - 30,000 kip or $3.6 - an absolute record. In Thailand several times it was 200 baht ($5.5) and in Cambodia in Banlung $5, but usually I pay more because I live in a room with air conditioning.
I spent the longest time in China - <b>84 days</b> (plus another 9 in Hong Kong, and if you also count Taiwan...). Russia is in second place - 59 days. Thailand is in third - 52 days. In fourth place is Cambodia, 39 days. I was in other countries for less than a month.
Of the cities other than Moscow, I spent the longest in Bangkok - <b>16 days</b> of rest, work, and solving of everyday problems. Cambodian Sihanoukville remained a little behind - 14 days. Other cities:
9 days - Pattaya, Hong Kong
8 days - Kuala Lumpur
7 days - Mindoro Island (Philippines), Siem Reap
6 days - Seoul, Shanghai, Chongqing
5 days - Phnom Penh, Patong, Malacca, Taipei, Jeju

During the year I took <a href="http://flightdiary.net/danielzorin">23 <b>flights</b></a>, much less than in 2013 and 2014, because when you are not in a hurry, there is less need to fly. The Philippines had the most flights because they are islands.
I traveled by <b>trains</b> (intercity) in the following countries: Russia, Mongolia, Slovakia, China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand.
By <b>subway</b> in the cities: Moscow, Berlin, Budapest, Harbin, Changchun, Shenyang, Tianjin, Beijing, Xi'an, Chongqing, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Busan, Seoul, Manila, Taipei, Kaohsiung, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur.

<b>Expenses</b> for March-December amounted to $13,625, or about <b>$45 per day</b>. In China it was $40-42, then three months of expensive countries: Korea, Philippines, Taiwan, Hong Kong - everywhere for $50-60 a day. But then four months of cheap countries - Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, Laos - $25-30 per day.
It will be even hotter in 2016. I’ll start January with stories about the Philippines.
