This year I went to Iran, fortunately flying there from Turkey is inexpensive and quick, the country is large and very interesting - one of the key countries in the Middle East with a thousand-year history.
I flew to Tehran, then flew to Mashhad, Bandar Abbas, and traveled the whole country from south to north, then returned to Turkey by land.

<b>Visa</b>
A visa to Iran is obtained in two stages. First, you need to obtain a pre-visa (aka reference code) remotely via the Internet, and then get the visa itself at the Iranian Embassy or at the airport upon arrival. Theoretically, you can get a visa on arrival without a pre-visa, but in reality this is a very big risk that you won’t be allowed to board the plane, so it’s better not to do that.
Recently, a visa is not pasted into the passport, and the passport isn't even stamped at the border (the Iranians made sure that there would be no unnecessary questions later when entering Israel or the USA), and the two-stage system apparently remained from the times when the visa was pasted. Now the visa is just a piece of paper.
You can get a pre-visa in two ways: by filling out a form on the <a href="https://evisatraveller.mfa.ir/en/request/applyrequest/">official website</a> (free), or through a travel agency (issue price about 30 euros, I did it <a href="https://iran.1stquest.com/ru/visa/apply#/form">here</a>). The official website very often refuses (not completely, just sends you to apply through a travel agency), and on what principles it is not clear. Therefore, I immediately applied through a travel agency (especially since I had to get the visa quickly). There you don’t need any documents except a scan of your passport and an approximate route, without hotel reservations. The visa is given for as many days as indicated in the itinerary, at least that’s what the agency told me, and in the end my visa also indicated the number of days as in my itinerary (I made up a long itinerary to have backup).
When applying for the pre-visa, you must immediately indicate where you will receive the visa, and it seems that this cannot be changed. In Turkey, there are only embassies in Istanbul and Ankara, so I chose the Tehran airport. Upon arrival, you need to have medical insurance, which clearly states that it is valid in Iran (I purchased it separately). You also need to pay for the visa; for Russian citizens the fee is 70 euros, plus a three dollar commission at the airport. In total, taking into account the pre-visa and insurance, all costs for the visa amounted to about 120 euros, which turns out to be one of the most expensive visas.


<b>Money</b>
Iran's currency is called the rial, and its exchange rate is currently the lowest in the world: 1 dollar = 280 thousand rials! You will not just be a millionaire, but a multimillionaire. Historically, prices are usually referred to verbally in “tomans”, one toman = 10 rials. In writing, tomans are also used, except for any online stores and applications where reals are written (for example, taxi applications, sites for booking hotels and air/bus tickets). Since all prices now have a large number of zeros, in fact, you can simply consider 1 dollar = 28 tomans (not 28 thousand). Denomination is now being carried out; two numbers are already written on the new banknotes, for example “100 thousand rials” and “10 tomans”. Below, for the sake of brevity, I will indicate prices in denominated tomans.
The exchange rate collapse occurred relatively recently, so the bills are all small. The largest bill is 100 tomans (million rials), but it is rare. The most common banknote is 50 tomans ($1.6); money changers usually give it out in packs. There are also 10, 5, 2 tomans (often used) and 1, 0.5 tomans (rarely used, usually rounded up).
Visa/Mastercard bank cards do not work in Iran, so you need to take all your money in cash. You can change it at exchange offices or with money changers, who often hang out on the street next to the exchange offices. As I understand it, exchangers mainly deal not with cash, but with transfers abroad and back, so more than once the exchanger refused to exchange cash dollars for me - like, there are no rials. In one exchange office they asked me to come next morning, the owner went to the bank and brought a pack of rials to exchange for my 200 dollars. The best rate I saw, oddly enough, was at Tehran airport upon arrival.
In Iran, payment by cards of the local Shatab system is very common. Locals, it seems, are sometimes not aware of the differences between Shatab and MasterCard, because in many places they asked me if I could pay with a card, and were very surprised that I could not. In the metro you can often buy a ticket only with a card (even at the ticket office); several times I was allowed in for free because of this.

<b>Language</b>
The main language in Iran is Persian (aka Farsi). Dari (the language of Afghanistan) and Tajik are also dialects of Persian or languages ​​very close to it. Also, about 20% of the population of Iran are Azerbaijanis (twice as many Azerbaijanis live in Iran as in Azerbaijan itself), so in the north there is a chance that you will be understood in Turkish, which is close to Azerbaijani. An interesting fact is that until the 20th century, the Azerbaijani language was the language of interethnic communication in Iran and Transcaucasia, as well as the language of the local nobility (much like in the Russian Empire at that time the nobles spoke French, and they might not even know Russian well).
The Persian language belongs to the Indo-European family, so it has a syntax that is relatively close to us (unlike Turkish), phonetics doesn't have complex sounds as in Arabic, and there are many recognizable roots and grammatical forms. But there is a lot of Arabic vocabulary instead of the usual Latin/Greek, and the formation of the plural of many words by changing the vowels at the root is also borrowed from Arabic. I recognized many words thanks to my knowledge of Turkish - both Arabic and Turkic, and some words, on the contrary, came to Turkish from Persian.
In general, at first glance, this language is more complex than English, Spanish or Hindi, but a little simpler than Russian, Albanian or Celtic (there are no cases, for example).
But there is an additional difficulty - the writing is based on the Arabic alphabet, which makes it more difficult to learn to read. Before this trip, I finally learned to read Arabic letters, which was very useful - you can at least find your bus at the station, it’s easy to distinguish license plates when waiting for a taxi.
Very few people speak English, much like in eastern Turkey.

<b>Hotel</b>
Most booking services (booking.com, agoda) do not work in Iran, but HostelWorld.com works (I booked a hotel there in Tehran for the first days), there is also a website hotelyar.com, where there are more options. But in general, besides Tehran, I didn’t book anywhere, I just came to a cluster of hotels on the map and searched on the spot, like in the good old days in Asia.
There are very cheap hotels (15-30 tomans, that is, $5-10), in which the conditions are not very good - shared showers, very rundown rooms, no Wi-fi. There are more expensive hotels ($20-25), which look solid and are also quite decent inside. But there are fewer of them, and at times they may not have rooms available (I’ve encountered this more than once or twice in different cities).
Not the cheapest hotels usually include a typical Iranian breakfast, reminiscent of Turkish, only with fewer elements.

<b>Transport</b>
Domestic flights are very developed in Iran. There are at least 10 different airlines alone (for comparison, in Turkey with a similar size and population there are three). Because of the sanctions, it seems that old planes and spare parts for them are imported here with some complex schemes, but as a non-specialist, I didn’t notice this - well, a plane is a plane. There are a lot of flights from Tehran and Mashhad, and not so few between other cities.
The main problem is how to find and buy tickets, since Iranian airlines are not available on the usual booking sites. I solved the issue this way. The most accurate schedule can be viewed on flightmapper.net for each airport. You can also use Yandex.Schedules.
You can only buy tickets on airline websites using Iranian cards, but there are some foreign aggregators that sell them and accept regular cards. I used the Turkish site obilet.com, where I usually buy bus tickets in Turkey. The prices there were slightly lower than on Western sites.
Prices for domestic flights are very low, about 30-50 dollars per flight (these are not low-cost airlines, they even seem to include luggage).

The main land public transport is collective taxis, called "sawari" in Persian. If you need to go to a neighboring city, then look for a parking lot where the sawaris leave, or you can ask a taxi to take you there, since it is not always easy to understand from the map where the sawaris are clustered. In Iran, the government subsidizes the price of gasoline, and combined with low wages, this makes taxis here abnormally cheap - about $1 for 15 kilometers! For comparison, in Turkey for $1 you can travel only one and a half kilometers, and somewhere in Western Europe - 300-500 meters. This means that 150 kilometers to a neighboring city costs $10, so it's afforable even if you don't wait for other passengers (this is called “dar bast” in Persian).
I realized that I needed to use sawari only in the second half of the trip, and before that I tried to ride intercity buses. They actually cost only a little less than sawari, but the main problem is that they are very difficult to find. It feels like cheap sawari has almost killed the bus industry in Iran, which is why most of the huge bus stations on the outskirts of cities are practically empty, with something departing once an hour. Buses seem to be used only for very long distance travel (500+ kilometers). Moreover, if the buses do not call at any cities along the way, even large ones, you will be dropped off on a bypass route, and you can also hail there if there are seats. For example, from the large city of Qom to neighboring Tehran (a couple of hours' drive) there is nothing going from the bus station. From the bus station you can go to Mashhad or Tabriz at the othr side of the country. For Tehran, you need to board a passing bus on the highway.
Bus schedules can be found on payaneh.ir. I learned the Arabic alphabet and was able to use this site, but I can say that not all buses are there.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946303119_25bfe74d1a_o.jpg" title=""/>
There are also intercity trains, but I have never traveled on them. There are few trains, and almost all of them are night trains, so they are not suitable for traveling between intermediate points. It seems that the Tehran-Qom-Isfahan high-speed line is being built. Qom is the only city with a more or less reasonable daily schedule, there are 5-6 trains a day, but they run from the station, which is another 30 kilometers away. Apparently, this is a preparation for a high-speed line, but judging by the fact that the train runs 2 hours, now this is still far from a Shinkansen.

<b>Urban transport</b>
Five cities have metro: Tehran, Mashhad, Shiraz, Isfahan, Tabriz; There are a couple more under construction. It seems that China is helping - at least the cars are Chinese. There are 8 metro lines in Tehran, while other cities have 1-2 so far. The fare is a symbolic 2.5 tomans in Tehran and 2 tomans in other cities. This is probably the cheapest metro in the world.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945965476_019c04fbcf_o.jpg" title=""/>
There are also city buses, but there are quite a few of them, and it’s impossible to figure out the routes.
The main transport is taxi. Since even an intercity taxi is super cheap, in city it's almost free - a trip on average costs $0.50, rarely more than $1. In Iran there is an application called Snapp - an analogue of Uber (you need an Iranian mobile phone number to register). I almost always traveled through it, so that I didn’t have to explain in words where to go. This application works in all cities, even in smaller ones. You can catch a taxi just on the street, there are plenty of them everywhere - apparently, many locals use it instead of public transport.

<b>Food</b>
As for food, the situation here reminded me most of <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/471286.html">Bangladesh</a> and other very poor countries. Locals seem to eat at home rather than in restaurants. Therefore, it can be very difficult to find a place to eat; there are simply very few of them even in the very center of the city.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946303114_d2dbec0564_o.jpg" title=""/>
The food is quite monotonous, basically there are kebabs everywhere, which have a slightly different shape than in Turkey. As a side dish in Iran, they give you a large plate of rice and a couple of heavily fried tomatoes. The price of such a lunch is around 150 tomans.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946227843_450958f85d_o.jpg" title=""/>
From time to time I came across restaurants with European food, they are quite good, the prices are also quite reasonable - it's hard to spend more than 300 tomans.
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946227923_36ecf07cb1_o.jpg" title=""/>
There are practically no food supermarkets; I found only one during the entire trip. In ordinary small stores prices are practically not indicated anywhere, so I can’t say much about prices. I know for sure that 1.5 liters of Coca-Cola (yes, there is Coca-Cola in Iran) costs 20 tomans, a small bottle of 0.33 costs 6-7 tomans.

<b>Internet</b>
I bought an IranCell SIM card at the airport upon arrival for 120 tomans ($4), there were 15 gigabytes of traffic. It is better to do this right away, as there may be all sorts of difficulties with purchasing in the city.
In hotels everywhere the Internet was poor or non-existent. In cheap hotels (about $10) there was no Internet, in more expensive ones ($20-25) there was, but it was limited in time or traffic (at 500 MB per day).
The biggest inconvenience is the colossal censorship. In Iran, actually half of the Internet is blocked; even in China it was not so bad. Moreover, blocking also applies to foreign sites, incl. Russian-speaking, and absolutely random. That is, I’m not surprised that 4chan was banned, but why weren’t they pleased with half of the sites selling airline tickets or the Turkish e-government portal? Also, many VPNs that I used in Russia to bypass blocking were also blocked, so I had to look for new ones.

<b>What to see</b>
Historic architecture has not survived in most Iranian cities, as in Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries, but there are a few exceptions. But there are many original palaces and huge mosques. Mosques in Iran are Shiite (in almost all other Muslim countries they are Sunni), and some of the most popular ones may not allow people of other faiths.
In terms of nature, most of Iran's territory is desert or semi-desert, but there is also a greener part in the north near the Transcaucasus and the Caspian Sea.

<b>Tehran</b> is the capital, a very large city. There is much to see - different palaces, parks, observation decks. There is also more civilization here, and it’s easier to find where to eat.

<b>Mashhad</b> is the second largest city, located far in the east near the border with Afghanistan and Turkmenistan. There is the mausoleum of Imam Reza - the main site of Shiite pilgrimage in Iran.

I have not been to the regions near the border with Pakistan (Zahedan, Bam, Kerman) and in the west along the border with Iraq (Hamadan, Ahwaz, Abadan)

<b>Total</b>
In two weeks, I spent $830, of which $126 was for a visa, $280 for travel (including three flights for $120 and quite a bit of taxi travel between cities). I spent an unusually large amount on museums ($66), because each one individually is quite cheap (they usually cost 100 or 50 tomans), in the end I probably went to more than 20 museums throughout the country.
