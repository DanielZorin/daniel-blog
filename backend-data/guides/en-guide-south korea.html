My stay in cozy South Korea has ended. At first, this country seemed dull and gray to me, and because of the increased expenses after China, I even thought about shortening my stay to three weeks. But over time, this country has opened up from the best side. Korea is probably not a country that will delight you in a week, but after a month I can set it up as an example in many respects.

<b>The route</b> by day turned out like this:
Jeju - 5 nights
Busan - 4 nights
Gyeongju - 3 nights
Daegu - 2 nights
Gwangju - 2 nights
Daejeon - 2 nights
Sokcho - 2 nights
Samcheok - 1 night
Seoul - 6 nights

<b>Language</b>
The Korean language is quite difficult to master. Koreans love cumbersome politeness structures (even more than the Japanese, it seems), which can make even simple sentences seem long. If you know Chinese or Japanese, then many words will seem familiar, because they come from the same readings of Chinese characters.
Korean pronunciation is easier to master than Chinese. There are no tones here, but there is also a difference between aspirated and unaspirated consonants. In writing, the English transcription is similar to the English transcription of Chinese, but Russian transcription is different, so many places are written differently, like Busan in Russian is written "Pusan".
The Korean alphabet is easy to learn in a day and is very logical: similar sounds are represented by similar letters. Thus, all aspirated and unaspirated consonants in writing are distinguished by one horizontal line. Knowing the letters, you can easily enter any text into the translator on your phone and gradually master the names of popular dishes in restaurants.
In Korea, English is understood much better than in China, although in motels and eateries they often do not speak English. In general, I did not experience much problems with the service and navigation due to the language barrier.

<b>Money</b>
It is convenient to estimate that 1000 Korean won = $1. The exact rate is 1100 for $1. The best rate is in the Russian quarters of Seoul and Busan.
Expenses for 27 days amounted to $1,616 (for two people), almost exactly $60 per day. You can live on $50 if you save a lot.

<b>Accomodation</b>
Hotels in Korea start at 25,000 won ($23), and this is the main expense. Only once was it possible to move in for 20,000. The good news is that the quality of housing for such a price is very high. It's worse in only two main cities, Seoul and Busan.
The algorithm for finding housing in Korea is as follows. In every city there are places where hotels are concentrated. One of them is the bus station, so you don’t have to go far from it. On the naver and daum maps you can highlight all the hotels, although prices are not indicated. If the building looks like a baroque palace, it’s a love motel that Koreans rent for a few hours for obvious purposes. In the neighborhood there may be less kitschy establishments also under the “motel” guise. Usually all of them has a logo in the form of three vertical wavy lines above a semicircle. There are also establishments under the sign of “yeogwan”, these are, in theory, traditional Korean hotels where people sleep on the floor, but the difference between a yeogwan and a motel is sometimes difficult to discern. Simetimes in Yeogvans the interior look old, however, the furnishings themselves will be very fresh, not twenty years old.
The price is often posted on a sign at the reception, but sometimes you can bargain and you can knock off 5 thousand. The unpleasant thing is that on weekends the price in most motels almost doubles.
In terms of quality, Korean hotels will delight you. The rooms are very cozy and spacious. In my opinion, Korea has the best ratio of hotel prices to quality in the world I know. In Daejeon, we even had a home theater in our room, where we watched Game of Thrones for half a day. Among the shortcomings, oddly enough, there is often no Internet in hotels, or it is poor. In Jeju and Busan I had to use a neighbor’s wi-fi, fortunately in Korea it’s easy to find one without a password.
Hostels in Korea are not an option; a bed usually costs at least 15,000; a hotel is better.
It seems like you can spend the night in the baths, it’s cheaper than a hotel, but it’s inconvenient: you need to keep your luggage somewhere until the evening, then leave early in the morning. We have never tried such an economical way to spend the night.

<i>Best hotel ever</i>

<b>Transport between cities</b>
There are trains in Korea, but buses are cheaper and more frequent. From any city, even a small one, there are direct flights to Seoul, and there are also connections between major cities approximately once an hour. There are two types of buses: cheaper ones with four seats in a row and more expensive ones with three. It’s about 30-40% more expensive, but there’s no difference in comfort, so it makes sense to find out the schedule of the cheap ones, because there are fewer of them. The price is sometimes suddenly not proportional to the distance. It is impossible to find out the price for non-obvious destinations via the Internet, and navigators lie, so get ready for surprises. Between the main cities, prices and schedules can be found at <a href="kobus.co.kr/web/eng/02_service/service01.jsp">kobus.co.kr/web/eng/02_service/service01.jsp</a> .
All buses in Korea run half empty, like trains in Europe. Sometimes even 90% empty. There is no point in buying tickets in advance.
If you are short on time, you can look at the high-speed trains that run on the Airport-Seoul-Daejeon-Daegu-Busan and Seoul-Daejeon-Gwangju routes. A ticket from Seoul to Busan costs about $50, twice as much as by bus.
Jeju Island can be reached by plane from any city on the mainland or by ferry from Incheon and southern coastal cities. I took a plane ticket from Jeju to Busan for $30. I wanted to fly to Gwangju to avoid detours, but I was unable to pay on the Twai Air website with my credit card. The ferry runs at more convenient times and costs the same.

<b>Urban transport</b>
Travel in Korea is expensive, so unlike China, where I didn’t think much about taking a bus for 1-2 yuan or walking, here I had to act carefully. Travel around the city costs 1000-1200 won, outside the city it's more expensive, up to 3-4 thousand. At Jeju airport, I got a T-money card, which can be topped up at 7-11 stores, and I used it to pay for travel everywhere except commuter routes in distant Sokcho and Samcheok. T-money is accepted in all major cities. The card costs 2,500 won and the deposit cannot be returned. Each trip with the card will be 50-100 won cheaper than cash, plus transfers are almost free. If you only plan to take the Seoul metro, you don't need a card; otherwise, it's worth the price.

<b>Food</b>
While in China we went to the local catering almost every day, in Korea this was not the case. Restaurants here are not very cheap, so it makes sense to explore the selection of shops.
<img alt="" src="images/guide-south korea-27825_original.png" title=""/>
To begin with, forget about vegetables and fruits. If you don’t have a golden card, then bananas and potatoes at $5 per kilogram will not be affordable for you; it’s better to go to Switzerland to eat such delicacies, it’s cheaper there. In Korea, your diet will consist of much more mundane things like lobster and marbled beef.
There are two good stores: E-mart and Home Plus. At Home Plus you can buy all kinds of snacks cheaply, and at E-mart you can buy nutritious food. They sell ready-made dishes of fried meat and seafood: squid, octopus, sets of sea life and sushi. All this is reasonably priced, but the best part begins at 9 pm, when perishable goods begin to be discounted. Then you can grab three pieces of sushi for a dollar, a large portion of meat for 4-5 dollars and other joys. In addition, E-mart sells raw seafood, and they are discounted too! So you can buy a lobster for only 5 (!!!) dollars. 200-300 grams of scallops for 5-6 dollars. Prawns are generally almost free.
As for restaurants, in fact, it is also quite possible to go to them, but you need to choose, since the prices in the first one you come across will most likely be high. The classical dish is samgyeopsal, which is pork that you grill right on your table. 200 grams of meat costs 6-7 thousand won (if you are careful and find a cheap place). Simpler dishes: soups, noodle dishes, rice with vegetables (bibimbap) cost less, 3-5 thousand won. Rolls, dumplings are 1500-2500 won. It’s very nice that any restaurant offers free appetizers with the main course. One time they even gave us squid for a snack! In canteens there are 2-3 snacks, usually spicy kimchi cabbage and radish; with more expensive dishes they can even give you free noodle soup.
By being so careful about choosing inexpensive places, I tried all the main Korean dishes without breaking the bank.
Unlike China, there is no point in going to restaurants to eat noodles with seasonings; it is better to buy the same in the store. In Korea, they even sell the brand “Dosirak” that is so popular in Russia.
Street food in Korea is very expensive. What costs 1-2 yuan in China costs 1-2 dollars in Korea, that is, six times more expensive. Paying a dollar for a fried sausage is a pointless luxury.
Ice cream costs from 500 won (in a supermarket) and up to 1000 won in the most touristy places. Lots of delicious and unusual types. My favorites: ice cream with caramel flavor, coffee flavor, mango flavor.

<b>Internet</b>
As I already said, sometimes there is no Wi-fi in hotels. You can often catch a neighbor's, usually named "iptime". There is no Wi-Fi on buses.
There are two main operators in Korea: KT and SK, the first, according to reviews, seems to have more convenient prepaid tariffs. In fact, 3G doesn't come cheap. 1 gigabyte for a month costs 15,000 won, it seems inexpensive, but for the SIM card itself they charge another 8,000. The next day, after shopping, I was disconnected from the Internet, because it turned out that I needed to have a non-zero balance for calls, and it was impossible to deposit less than 5,000 won . The total is more than $25 per gigabyte for one month. It's cheaper in China.
3G catches everywhere, incl. on intercity buses, but the quality is poor. It is absolutely impossible to talk on Skype over 3G. GPS in Korea works very poorly, it constantly shows the position where you were an hour ago.

<b>Navigation</b>
There are two Korean phone maps: Daum and Naver. Both have certain disadvantages. Naver looks much nicer visually, but it is incredibly difficult to navigate. It’s easier to lay out routes in Daum, but, as practice has shown, you can’t trust the information 100%. Once or twice there have been incorrect data about bus schedules and prices. Coupled with virtually non-functional GPS navigation, this makes travel somewhat less convenient.
In Korea, as in Europe, in all cities in tourist centers they give out free city maps, I have used them many times.

<b>Entertainment</b>
It’s very nice that entrance to various attractions in Korea is either free or inexpensive.
Jeju Seogwipo Waterfall - 2,000 won
Jeju Lava Cave - 2,000 won
Jeju Peak of Dawn - 2,000 won
Jeju, Mount Halla - free
Gyeongju, Yangdong Village - free
Gyeongju, Bulguksa Temple - 4,000 won
Gyeongju, Anapchi Pond - 2,000 won
Gwangju Dolmen Park - free
Sokcho, Seoraksan National Park - 3,500 won for entrance, another 10,000 for the cable car.
Samcheok Penis Park - 3,000 won
Seoul, Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung Palaces - 3,000 won each
Seoul, Jongmyo Monastery - 1000 won with excursion
Seoul, Royal Tombs near Seolleung Subway - 1000 won
Seoul, Namhansanseong Fortress - free
Seoul, Hwaseong Fortress (in the neighboring city of Suwon) - free
Seoul, Suwon Palace - 1500 won

<b>Other expenses</b>
Internet cafe printing costs 300 won per page (500 won for color)
We found the cheapest passport photo for 8,000. In the metro they cost 10,000.
A phone card costs 10,000 won for 2 hours.
In Korea, cosmetics are inexpensive and of very high quality, but hygiene products are expensive. It’s good that hotels provide shampoo and toothbrushes with toothpastes.
Korea is a good place to shop for clothes. Local brands are inexpensive and stylish. I bought myself pants for 20,000 won and shorts for 10,000 won.

In conclusion, according to tradition, there are a few <b>cool places</b> that are worth visiting.
