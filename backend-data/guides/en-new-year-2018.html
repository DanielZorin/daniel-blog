It's time to look back at 2018! This year I only traveled for about three months in total. The year was dedicated to financial rehabilitation for previous failures, especially in 2017, when I went into a serious red area. With two new jobs, I managed to earn more in 2018 than in the previous three years combined.

This year I returned to traveling around the regions of Russia (the first trip, however, was at the very end of December 2017, but we can add that too for completeness). After a massive study of Russia in 2013-2014, for three years I went almost nowhere, except for Moscow and St. Petersburg and a couple of other cities passing through. New regions have been added: Tambov, Lipetsk, Penza, Saratov, Rostov, Tomsk, Kemerovo, Kirov regions, Mordovia, Adygea, Udmurtia.

I have stayed in <b>41 hotels</b> (including hostels and airbnbs), in 2 houses. I also spent 10 nights on the road.
During the year I took <a href="http://flightdiary.net/danielzorin">41 <b>flights</b></a> - much more than last year, and two less than the record 2014.
