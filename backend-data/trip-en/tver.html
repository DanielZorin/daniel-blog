<h1>Russia: Solnechnogorsk, Tver</h1>
<i>27-28 July 2013</i>
<h2>Solnechnogorsk</h2>
<p>
Solnechnogorsk is located in the Moscow region. I was there a year ago passing through, and called it “the city of millionaires” because of how fancy bus tickets looked, but this time I had a little more time to see the town. Solnechnogorsk is famous primarily for the fact that the Moscow-St. Petersburg highway passes through it, and there are always traffic jams there.

<p>
There is nothing else in Solnechnogorsk.

<p>
What are houses made of?
<p/>

<p>
The only old house I've ever seen.

<p>
The shawarma stall is still worth it.

<p>
Lenin too.
<p/>

<p>
Next to Lenin, a hammer and sickle has been preserved.

It's nice in the central square. Almost Trafalgar Square.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256284289_63c427003d_o.jpg">
<p>
There is even a tent with souvenirs.
<p/>

<p>
There are several traditional monuments in the square.
<p/>

<p>
Well, traditional illumination.

<h2>Tver</h2>
<p>
Tver is clearly unlucky with its leadership. While Yaroslavl, Vladimir and Kostroma have been put in order (in the center), money continues to be wasted in Tver. Guys, this is the embankment in the main city park, in the very center! Why can’t this area be completed so that it is as well-groomed as a piece of the embankment a little further away?
<p/>

<p>
The center of Tver is very beautiful, but needs renovation.
<p/>

<p>
What's going on with the balconies?
<p/>

<p>
All the juiciest things are on the other side of the river, where they build cottages behind fences.
<p/>

<p>
On the other side...
<p/>

<p>
The old house was converted into a cinema.
<p/>

<p>
The store is apparently from Soviet times. Note the peeling paint on the right.
<p/>

<p>
Square with a monument to Krylov. Russia, what can I say.
<p/>

<p>
Beach. As they explained to us, the coastline was severely damaged this year by the spring flood.
<p/>

Let's go across the river. Traditionally, the areas across the river are centers of culture.
<p/>

<p>
Church.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255665066_ab1620a390_o.jpg">
<p>
And here we are on the same embankment with cottages, which was shown just above. Here, not only the cottages are fenced off, but also a small pier, and a separate descent to it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255665086_db92d8071f_o.jpg">
<p>
And the view of the city center from here is also quite good.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254935882_51251c8c45_o.jpg">
<p>
At least they cleaned up the central street.
<p/>

<p>
Nearby stands the main modern attraction of Tver - the monument to Mikhail Krug, the most popular singer of Russian chanson (sad songs about thug life and prisons). Mikhail Krug is so popular that his portrait is even printed on souvenir refrigerator magnets.
<p/>

<p>
The monument is a sobriety zone.

Jungle in the city center.

<p>
There are several interesting establishments on the main street. This is similar to KFC, but much cheaper. I approve.
<p/>

<p>
The bar is hung with red banners and there is a portrait of Lenin. Although it would be more correct to call this place a restaurant/cafe rather than a bar.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255664711_920466e294_o.jpg">
<p>
Outside there are portraits of Saddam Hussein, Muammar Gaddafi and Che Guevara, and inside - of Kalinin himself.
<p/>

<p>
Mmm. The font is familiar, isn't it?
<p/>

<p>
Transport in Tver is represented by old trams...
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256710460_d6f3a322f5_o.jpg">
<p>
...trolleybuses in the colors of the Russian flag...
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255868623_828c520321_o.jpg">
<p>
...and buses, some of which are minibuses.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254935967_480791e386_o.jpg">
<p>
I must say that Tver has very good and convenient maps at bus stops.
<p/>

<p>
The schedules are beautiful, similar to <a href="../pskov">Pechory</a>
<p/>

<p>
Crossings have arrows, like in St. Petersburg.
<p/>

Someone crashed into the trash can and flattened it.

The sign is like in the Canary Islands.

The Russian Post office is incredible.

Tver's Lenin. At the pedestal there is a real tribune.

Opposite the station you can see the process of assembling the Russian Orthodox Church temple, as if from a construction set.
