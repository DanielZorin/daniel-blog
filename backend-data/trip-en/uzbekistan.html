<h1>Uzbekistan: Andijan, Tashkent, Bukhara, Samarkand, Shahrisabz</h1>
<i>4-11 May 2013</i>
<h2>Andijan</h2>
<p>
The taxi driver who took me to Andijan did not speak Russian at all. After four and a half hours on the Kyrgyz-Uzbek border, I stopped being surprised by anything. Communication took place through an interpreter, whom the taxi driver called on his mobile phone.
</p>
<p>
Andijan is a provincial city, there is not much to see there. Nothing reminds us of the mass shootings in 2005. I took a taxi to Tashkent, it cost only about $10 for a six-hour car ride. As usual in such taxis, there are four passengers and a driver. The silent old lady slept most of the way. The man in the front seat didn’t know a single word of Russian, and I never learned anything about him. My neighbor could explain himself a little, as he said, he learned it when he worked on construction sites in the city of Kursk. The driver turned out to be the same age as me, he managed to work in a beauty salon in Moscow. They treated me kindly, asked where I wanted to go, and whether I liked Andijan. After the crowd of gloomy faces in line at customs, it was very pleasant.

<p>
The stop at the bazaar in Kokand is unremarkable. It's time to explain about money. There are three banknotes in Uzbekistan - 200, 500 and 1000 sum. $1 is approximately 2700 sum. When you exchange $100, you get three packs of banknotes. This is Uzbekistan. Everyone's skills in quickly counting the number of pieces of paper in thick wads of money are excellent. Change for 100 sum is given in the form of candy. It feels like you are in Zimbabwe during the times of hyperinflation, when everyone went to buy bread with suitcases of money.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255947347_1f6042572e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The road after Kokand is suddenly quite beautiful, hills, mountains on the horizon.
</p>
<p>
The man-made landscape outside the window is depressing. Collapsing houses, barracks, herds of donkeys and sheep wandering along the roadway along with cars, and many posters about a bright future, but not Soviet ones, but modern ones, written in Uzbek.
</p>
<p>
The next stop is near the city of Angren. Angren is a typical Soviet industrial city. Smoking factories and rows of five-story buildings with Soviet patterns on the ends. In Angren we had dinner at a diner. The menu is only in Uzbek, the waitresses also speak only the state language. In Kyrgyzstan, I studied many names of local dishes, so I was able to recognize the excellent lagman in “logmon”.
</p>
<p>
The secret of how cheap taxis are over longer distances is that the cars run on “gas fuel”, and gas is produced in Uzbekistan itself. During refueling, all passengers must get out of the car and wait for it at the exit of the gas station.
</p>
<p>
My phone was blowing up with text messages. Beeline greeted me four times: three times in Uzbekistan and once in Tajikistan, informed me that I was roaming, and kindly gave me the phone number of the Russian Embassy in Uzbekistan.
</p>
<h2>Tashkent</h2>
<p>
When we arrived in Tashkent, it was already dark (and I expected to get there by five o’clock). Tashkent at night looks like some kind of poor Dubai. It seems like you are driving along a lit street, surrounded by some pretentious buildings with columns, palaces of the local elite. Then you leave the main street, and the ugly part begins. The road is broken down, the sidewalk-path runs along a long fence, there is no light. In Moscow or Rio de Janeiro it’s not particularly scary to walk at night, but here I wouldn’t bother myself.
</p>
<p>
Using almost my last sum, I took a taxi to the cheapest hotel from Booking, which I did not have time to book due to lack of Internet. The prices are really good, especially in comparison with other hotels in Tashkent: only about $20 for a single room. But the administrator demanded payment immediately and refused to take a deposit in any currency until tomorrow. Well, that means we need to look for more adventures.
</p>
<p>
There was a cop hovering near the kiosk at the bus stop, so I moved in the other direction. Soon some women began to offer me... no, not what you thought, but to rent an apartment. But I could not, since then I would not get a registration, which threatens with a fine (read: robbery) when leaving the country. Another creepy old man was hanging out nearby, who said that he knew who would exchange 20 dollars for 56 thousand soums, but it was not clear what he wanted. The granny with the poker face says she doesn’t know anything about the black course. In the end, I had to agree to change money with those who rented apartments at the official rate of 40 thousand for 20 dollars. A car pulled up from somewhere, they gave me a wad of money, and I could go back to the hotel.
</p>
<p>
Hotel "Al-Khosilot" is a real museum of the USSR. If it cost 200 euros per night, it would be just like in Africa. On the floor, the eccentric attendant was playing solitaire. She gave me bed linen and shampoo, and as she left the door she said in such a flirting tone, “Would you like me to show you something?” I already thought that I had checked into the most natural brothel, but it turned out that it was just a lizard crawling in the corner of the corridor.

<p>
In the morning I went to the market and exchanged about 150 dollars.

<p>
Here I am a millionaire. An idiot's dreams come true!
</p>

<p>
Taxi drivers did not agree to take me to the market for the 4,000 soums that I had, although they write on the Internet that in the city they usually pay 2-3 thousand. I can’t imagine how you can bargain in such a situation. Bus travel costs 800 sum. The schedule style is familiar.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256651600_8baa6db35d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Buses in Tashkent are quite decent.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254876142_5b5e452d9a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also a metro, but riding it is unpleasant. At the entrance they check passports (including those of locals, although Uzbek passports are not opened) and inspect bags. Inside the carriages are like in Moscow, where instead of advertising there are posters “Vigilance is the need of the times.” In Tashkent, the regime has tightened the screws to the maximum. There are more police on the streets than people. Documents are checked constantly. In the city center there is a dead zone, empty streets.

Government buildings. There is a cordon a kilometer around. This is not Russia, where they write “Putin is gay” on the wall of the State Duma.
</p>

<p>
There are no monuments to Lenin in Uzbekistan. Only the pedestals remain.

The Globe of Uzbekistan monument is often placed on them.

<p>
The new idol of Uzbekistan is Tamerlane. Monuments are erected to him everywhere. It's almost as if in Italy they called Caesar the great Italian.

After the earthquake in the 60s, Tashkent was built up with panel houses.

Another popular architectural element is arches.

<p>
In the alleys there are private houses. What’s interesting is that here, like in South America, they store bags of garbage on the streets.

<p>
But there are a lot of patriotic posters with happy families.

<p>
Street signs similar to Moscow design. Or, on the contrary, were the signs in Moscow designed by Uzbeks?

Slightly less than all the cars in Uzbekistan are white, mostly Chevrolet Lacetti.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255606716_b20a855657_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is because Chevrolet is produced in Uzbekistan, and prices do not include customs duties.

<h2>Bukhara</h2>
<p>
Bukhara is very beautiful. The integrity of the architecture gives this city a special charm. A fairly large area in the center looks like a medieval city. Several streets with well-restored madrassas, hotels, shops, and souvenirs have been made for tourists. For everyone else, there are slums all around. Here they are visible from above.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257019225_5665f53a0a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is no need to specifically look for slums in Bukhara. They will find you themselves. Let's look at a typical example. Here we are in the central square of Bukhara. This is printed on postcards. In the center is the Kalyan minaret, on the right is the mosque of the same name.
</p>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255975421_0a8eaaa540_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On the left is the Miri-Arab madrasah. Let's walk past it further along the main street.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256724624_7c2b653f3b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Having passed the shopping arcades, straight ahead we see the Toki Zargaron Mosque on the left. On the right is the Abdulaziz Khan madrasah. Then the main street narrows, so we stay in this square and turn right.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255246112_5476bbc89a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a Tim Abdullah Khan market here.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256724734_eb71889495_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a temptation to go to Lyabi-Khauz Square, which, in theory, is directly ahead. Let's go ahead. The toilet is to the right, and we turn left.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255975531_2093e8f5ba_h.jpg"/>
<p>
What is this?
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256724834_e07c3e775d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Someone lives here.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256724794_7f6790848f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And next to it is a mountain of garbage.
</p>

It may be possible to get through, but it’s not obvious how.
</p>

<p>
It is very easy to get lost here, because the streets are poorly marked and form a labyrinth; you can circle for a long time.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255975786_2a225772f1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
However, local residents sometimes approached me, indicating with gestures where tourists were supposed to be.

Really. In each arch there is a store. Even inside, where there are two and a half rooms dedicated to Ulugbek, in the next room there is a store.
</p>

Samarkand, unlike Bukhara, is a patchwork city. The central street is restored.

Tiles similar to Moscow! Well, in Moscow and Samarkand, approximately the same people lay tiles.

<p>
There are several residential old quarters that look more austere than in Bukhara. At least the road here is paved.
</p>

What is typical is that there are ditches in the center of the road.

This is how I ended up in Shahi-Zinda, a place where there are mausoleums of rich people who lived in Samarkand several centuries ago.
</p>

<p>
There are also prices posted at the entrance to the Samarkand bazaar. What is characteristic is that here (and many other places in different cities) it is written in Cyrillic, although Uzbekistan has been writing in Latin for about 20 years.
</p>

<p>
The bazaar is huge.

<p>
Non - Samarkand bread.
</p>

<p>
The inscription is in Russian.

<p>
In Central Asia, there are washbasins on the street near catering establishments where you can wash your hands. They can be used to detect these establishments, since sometimes there are no signs. In Samarkand, at the bazaar, I generally found a huge canteen only by smell.

Bus in Samarkand. Fare: 500 som. The payment is collected by the “conductor” at the exit of the bus, and he also announces which route the bus is taking.
</p>

<p>
Samarkand, like Bukhara, is a must see among the cities of Central Asia.

Similar landscapes can be seen in photographs of those who have visited western and central Africa. But no, this is not Africa, this place was recently part of the Soviet Union.
</p>

<p>
The national hero of Uzbekistan, Tamerlane, was born here. A monument to him stands in the middle of the ruins.
</p>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255694868_208e0cfc79_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The palace is also in ruins.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255694833_724fc6b2bd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And the paths around it.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254760007_b7640c8d9b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And a theater.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256534810_1b3599920a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And even the sky, even Allah.

<p>
Let's take a walk around the city.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256534910_0b9c413618_h.jpg"/>
<p>
One street.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254760197_c5f29c9a56_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Another street.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255695053_cfaeffdaa8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And on a shady street...
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254760167_7762f94c1c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I'll stand in the shadows.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254760232_78b919b657_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Mountains of stones even on the roof canopies.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254760302_e77e5b43cb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Mosques are crumbling.

Welcome to Shahrisabz!
</p>

<p>
The ditches have been dismantled. Notice the white car right in the center. This is a local minibus with 5-6 seats. It's called "damas".
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256239044_065ec453e6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are money changers sitting at the entrance to the market, each with a bag of money at their feet, shouting loudly. The police don't care.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254760512_0d96778864_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And this is a market in the neighboring city of Kitab.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257023609_37e1179ac3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Kitab even has an underground passage. There is a parking lot for minibuses and taxis to Samarkand.
</p>

<p>
Although Shahrisabz is in ruins, the road itself is a compelling reason to go here.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254759917_4c6fea61da_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It goes through a mountain pass

Exactly here is the border of Samarkand and Kashkadarya regions.
</p>

<p>
On the descent there is a spring at which all drivers stop and pour water.

The borders of Tamerlane’s state, on the other hand, ran in the mountains near the modern city of Jizzakh.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256236661_b6e9f3c235_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a rock here, popularly called the "Gate of Tamerlane".
