<h1>Iran: Tehran, Mashhad, Bandar Abbas, Hormuz, Qeshm</h1>
<i>19-22 August 2022</i>
<h2>Tehran</h2>
<p>
The journey through Iran begins from the capital, Tehran. This is a very large city with a population of about 10 million, but visually it is not very different from other Iranian cities, since the historical architecture has been preserved only in isolated cases. Except that Tehran is richer than the province, so there are more restaurants and shopping centers.

<p>
Since foreign bank cards are not accepted in Iran, tourists can only use cash. Upon arrival, I exchanged a hundred dollars at the airport; oddly enough, the rate there was better than anywhere else later. I received 28 million and 600 thousand rials, which were given to me mostly in 100 thousand bills (these are two packs tied with bank tape), and the rest in larger 500 thousand bills. Later, they mostly gave me packs of 500k bills, which are not so inconvenient to carry around, since the prices for almost everything are very low.

<p>
Tehran has a fairly developed metro, although it goes to the international airport once every hour and a half.
<p/>

<p>
A metro ride cost 25 thousand rials, that is, for 1 dollar you can travel 11 times. Probably the cheapest metro in the world.

Traders selling all sorts of things walk around the carriages.

<p>
Many stations have bas-reliefs and mosaics like this, and they are different everywhere.

An artifact from the times of a pandemic. At that time, no one really wore masks anymore.
<p/>

<p>
In the metro there are these machines from which you can drink cold water for free. This is a common occurrence, for example, in the USA, but in poor countries I have never seen this happen on such a large scale before.
<p/>

<p>
They also appear just on the street.

<p>
The language spoken in Iran is mainly Persian, which is written in the Arabic alphabet (with a slight expansion). The signs on the streets are duplicated in English, but learning the alphabet was super useful (for example, on intercity buses the name of the city is not written in Latin).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52418382852_04a7e6a296_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The numbers are also unusual, especially you always confuse 7 and 8, which look like V and Л.
<p/>

<p>
Everywhere on the streets there are boxes like these, in theory they are intended for collecting zakat (Muslim “tithe”), although the hole is the size of coins, which have long been out of circulation.
<p/>

The ditches along the streets are like in Central Asia, only wider.

Women in Iran are forced to wear the hijab, but they are not as oppressed at work as in Saudi Arabia. It's funny that nowhere in the world have I met so many female taxi drivers as in Iran.
<p/>

Many people wear hijab in much the same way that masks were worn in Russia.

There are practically no large supermarkets, everything is in small shops and markets.
<p/>

<p>
There are almost no brands that are familiar to us, but there are many parodies of them (like in the Caucasus).

The standard meal in Iran is kebab, which comes with a huge pile of rice, butter, and fried tomatoes.
<p/>

Old bus. Due to sanctions in Iran, most of the transport is very old, including taxis, almost all of them are very rickety.

<p>
Everywhere on the streets hang portraits of “martyrs” - soldiers who died for their homeland.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52418384427_772da02354_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are enough martyrs in Iran; half a million died in the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), and the Iranian military is still involved in various conflicts in the Middle East (Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon, etc.).

The war against Iraq in Iran is called the "Eight Year Sacred Defense". Although after a couple of years it ceased to be a defense - the Iranians recaptured all the territories occupied at the beginning of the war and invaded Iraq itself, trying to overthrow Saddam Hussein and his pro-Sunni regime.

On the outskirts of Tehran there is a huge military (and other) cemetery.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52418358067_8474127772_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In Iranian cemeteries, the gravestones are almost at ground level and are placed close to each other, so that it is difficult not to step on them if you go deeper.

<p>
On the poster, Qassem Soleimani is the most famous Iranian martyr, a general who was killed by the Americans with a missile strike while he was in Iraq. This was at the very beginning of 2020 and was forgotten against the backdrop of subsequent events, but then there was a lot of commotion, and Iran even fired missiles at American military bases, although deliberately missed, so as to shoot for internal propaganda and not get a response.

Next to this cemetery is the mausoleum of Imam Khomeini, the leader of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

It is actually a large mosque with the imam's coffin in the center. Many other famous mosques in Iran are made according to the same principle, only they contain the relics of ancient prophets and saints.

Iran has had very bad relations with America since the Islamic Revolution of 1979. In the same year a crowd seized the American embassy, ​​and Khomeini approved it, like that’s what they deserve. An attack on an embassy is, by diplomatic standards, a very strong insult (once in the 19th century, the Iranians already had to apologize for the attack on the Russian embassy and give up the largest diamond to the Russia tsar). The Americans, though, also played against the rules - they tried to free the embassy employees captured in prison by force, landing special forces in Iran. The operation ended in failure; in the end, they were released only two years later, but the relationship was completely ruined. Sanctions against Iran have been in effect since 1979, they prohibit American companies from any activity in Iran, I cannot even work remotely from there or read work email (even in Russia this is still not prohibited, except in the territory of Crimea and Donetsk). It’s interesting that EU sanctions were introduced already in the 2000s, when Iran tried to create nuclear weapons, and before that Mastercard operated in Iran (unlike Visa). The former US Embassy has been turned into a museum.

It’s officially called a “den of espionage,” but it’s not particularly clear what’s so espionage about it. The usual telecommunications equipment, as in any embassy of that time.

There is no clearly defined center in Tehran, rather several central districts, like in <a href="../tokyo">Tokyo</a>. Probably the area most similar to the “center” is the area around the Golestan Palace and the central market nearby. There was an old city there from the Qajar dynasty (18th-19th century), although the fortress walls have not survived. The Shahs of the Pahlavi dynasty (who ruled in the 20th century) moved to a new palace on the outskirts of the city in the hills, and Golestan was used only for ceremonies.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52418884281_06623a8458_h.jpg"/>

<p>
Golestan Palace is included in the World Heritage List.

<p>
There is a funny ticket system, as happens in the Russian provinces - almost every room has its own separate exhibition-exposition with a separate ticket. I took a ticket to enter (100 tomans)   to the main palace (200 tomans), and then bought an additional ticket for the throne room (50 tomans), which turned out to be separate from the main part of the palace.

The paintings here are not Islamic. Under both the Qajars and the Pahlavis, Iran was not a particularly conservative country, at least among the ruling elite.

The palace, by the way, is not visible from the outside at all; various blocks from the second half of the 20th century were built around it. Although this is generally a feature not only of Iran, but also of many other countries in the Middle East - all life is inside the yard, outside there is just a wall or a fence. This is the only beautiful building opposite the palace.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52419324640_653239a40b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
To the south of the palace there is a bazaar. As in Turkey, the bazaar is a purely shopping area with no residential buildings. I was there on Friday, which is the equivalent of Sunday in Iran, and everything was empty (in Turkey it is also empty on Sundays).

<p>
If the street goes strictly north, in the distance you can see the mountains separating Tehran from the shores of the Caspian Sea. Tehran is on a hill, so it’s not very hot here, but it’s dry (due to the mountains).

<p>
I couldn't get to the top. Firstly, you can’t just buy a ticket; only cards are accepted, so foreigners are clearly not welcome. Even if you ask one of the locals to buy a ticket, you still have to stand in a huge line that goes around the entire floor. But you can go up several floors in the shopping center to the food court, there is also a good view in all directions.

<h2>Mashhad</h2>
<p>
Mashhad is the second largest city in Iran and is also a major pilgrimage center for Shiites. Mashhad is located in the northeast near the borders with Turkmenistan and Afghanistan, far from the main routes, so tourists from non-Muslim countries rarely appear there. I decided that the city was important enough to fly there, since there are flights to Mashhad from many Iranian cities.
<p/>

The area between Tehran and Mashhad is mostly desert.

In the very center of Mashhad is the mausoleum of Imam Reza. I had little time (the return flight was moved earlier), so I only managed to see the city center, and it seems that the whole city revolves around this mausoleum (I think Mecca is also like this around the Forbidden Mosque). All roads converge there, there are giant parking lots and hotels around the mausoleum, and nothing else. Everyone comes here to go to the mosque, not to walk around the streets and restaurants. Ordinary streets are unremarkable.

The complex is simply huge, about a kilometer per kilometer. In terms of area, it is the largest mosque in the world.
<p/>

Here is the most important building, which is in the middle. It is adjoined on four sides by huge squares, followed by other squares and galleries with passages. On this side the entrance to the central mosque is for women, and there is such a long queue.

<p>
In mosques you can find stands like these with round stones. The point is that the Prophet himself prayed on bare ground. Therefore, it is also correct to touch the ground when praying, and not a soft carpet. For this purpose, these pebbles exist, made from the soil of holy places (Karbala, Najaf, Mashhad, etc.), and it must be touched with the forehead. This is a Shiite tradition; I have never seen such stones in Sunni mosques.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52418420207_f35b6abbf5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I go inside the mausoleum. What is the essence of Shiites? After the death of the Prophet Muhammad, the question arose as to who should be his heir. Some (future Shiites) believed that the heir (imam) should be the closest relative (as in royal families), in the case of Muhammad this is Ali - the husband of his only daughter. Others (future Sunnis) believed that it was not so important and supported the influential Umayyad clan from Syria. As a result, first Ali himself was killed, and later, in the battle of the Iraqi city of Karbala, his son Hussein, which became the most tragic day for the Shiites; on the anniversary of the murder of Hussein, the Shiites come to Karbala and flagellate themselves.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52419213424_1bef1a3b6e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In total, the Shiites had twelve imams, starting with Ali. The last of them disappeared from the world in 872, and the Shiites believe that he, as the messiah (Mahdi), will return and do everything justly when Allah wishes. Of the 11 imams, four (2, 4, 5 and 6) are buried in Medina in Saudi Arabia, six are buried in Iraq (Ali in Najaf, Hussein in Karbala, 7 and 9 in Baghdad, 10 and 11 in Samarra), and the eighth Imam Reza - in Mashhad. You can communicate with the twelfth Imam in Qom, the second holy city of Iran, where the mosque has a well for messages.

<h2>Bandar Abbas</h2>
<p>
Bandar Abbas is a large city in the south of Iran, on the shores of the Strait of Hormuz (approximately opposite <a href="../uae">Dubai</a>). The city is not rich in attractions, but is a good base for a trip to the neighboring islands in the Persian Gulf. The climate here, due to its proximity to the sea, differs from other cities in Iran on the hot side; in August it was a real steam room.

<h2>Hormuz</h2>
<p>
Hormuz is a small island with a rich history, the center of trade in the Middle East with India and China, and a fortress controlling the entrance to the Persian Gulf. Marco Polo and Afanasy Nikitin visited this island. At the beginning of the 16th century, Hormuz was captured by the Portuguese and held until 1622, when the Persians recaptured it, after that they began to develop Bandar Abbas, and the island fell into disrepair. Now Hormuz has only one small town on the northern coast, near the ruins of a Portuguese fortress, but there is a lot of natural beauty around the island.

Near the tourist port there are local tuk-tukers, just like in Southeast Asia. For 500 tomans ($18) you can drive around the entire island. There is only one road around the perimeter; you can go a little deeper into the island only in one place.

Let's move on. The high, pointed hills in the center of the island are visible from everywhere.

It's funny that only the right side of the road is red with sand. It’s just that all the tuk-tuks with tourists go around the island counterclockwise, so they spread the red sand in only one direction.

<h2>Qeshm</h2>
<p>
Qeshm is a large island near Hormuz and Bandar Abbas. This is a free economic zone, and it seems that you can enter here without a visa (if you fly to the local airport). I don’t know how it is controlled that you won’t go to the mainland - when buying a ferry ticket, they didn’t look at my passport carefully, they just wrote down my name. The nature and architecture of Qeshm are in many ways similar to neighboring Hormuz - if you look at the program of a standard excursion, there will be salt caves, mangrove forests, and a Portuguese fortress.
<p/>

<p>
The city of Qeshm is quite large and there are high-rise hotels there.

The streets were very empty, my driver said that everyone comes out in the evening and it is too hot during the day.

If you go further, you can see that there is a flat desert towards the center of the island, and the valley behind is below this level.
