<h1>Russia: Tutayev, Yaroslavl, Pereslavl-Zalessky</h1>
<i>10-11 September 2018</i>
<h2>Tutayev</h2>
<p>
Tutayev is an unusual ancient city in the Yaroslavl region on the banks of the Volga. Initially, these were two cities called Romanov and Borisoglebsk on different banks, then they united and began to be called with a hyphen: Romanov-Borisoglebsk. In Soviet times, it was renamed in honor of some communist. At the same time, there is still no bridge in Tutaev; ferries cross the Volga, and the two parts are very different from each other. Buses run from Yaroslavl to both parts of Tutaev, but to the left bank quite rarely, 5 times a day, and to the right bank every 15 minutes from the northern outskirts and every hour from the station.

<p>
I arrived on the right bank (ex-Borisoglebsk). Along the highway there are Soviet panel houses. Now this part is much more populated, although initially Romanov was the more ancient and more important city.

<p>
For some reason the bus station is completely abandoned and collapsing. Buses stop just on the highway.

<p>
The central square, where the administration is, is striking in its emptiness, only parades with tanks are held.

Near the central square there is a park called "USSR".

Soviet sculptures of pioneers and collective farmers are collected here.

<p>
There is also a monument to Lenin here, most likely moved from one of the squares.

<p>
Since Borisoglebsk was originally smaller, there is no full-fledged ensemble of the city center; the old part is more reminiscent of a residential area of detached houses.
<p/>

A large ferry (for cars) runs to the other side about once an hour.

<p>
Without a car, the rest of the time it’s easy to cross on small motor boats that constantly go back and forth as soon as they have 2-3 passengers. The crossing costs only 30 rubles.

There is a completely different atmosphere here - only the historical center and old private houses.

The inscription has not changed for more than 100 years - after the revolution, the Ъ sign at the end was removed, but the place for it remained.

The Romanov part is, of course, very authentic, but unfortunately not everything here has been preserved.

<h2>Yaroslavl</h2>
<p>
Yaroslavl is a city where it’s nice to return. This is one of the most touristy cities in Russia; here you can easily meet guests from distant countries and the menu is in English.
<p/>

<p>
The central streets are pedestrian, just like in Europe.

It seems that in Yaroslavl there are rules for placing signs that prohibit spoiling the appearance of historical buildings. Very nice.

The arrow near the Volga looks somehow deserted, apparently, it is too far away from everything else in the city center.

In addition to the center, I walked around the Lenin monuments, many of which are quite close to the old city.

<h2>Pereslavl-Zalessky</h2>
<p>
Pereslavl-Zalessky for a long time remained the last city of the “Golden Ring” where I had not been. Probably because there is no railway here. On the other hand, you can get there from Moscow by bus in just an hour and a half, if you’re lucky, from the VDNKh metro station.
<p/>

<p>
The main street has been turned into the main highway leading through the entire city. It’s good that at least there is a bypass road, otherwise trucks would drive here. But it still looks unnatural - the main front street and the long wait at the traffic light.
