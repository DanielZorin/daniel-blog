<h1>Grenada</h1>
<i>29-30 April 2022</i>
<p>
On the new trip to the Caribbean, I started from Grenada and then moved along the chain of islands to the north, visiting all the countries that I had skipped on the first trip. Grenada was somewhat unique here, as it is surrounded on three sides by the countries that I visited: <a href="http://goo.gl/Wz7xih">Trinidad and Tobago</a> in the south, <a href="http://goo.gl/J8Go91">Saint Vincent and the Grenadines</a> in the north, <a href="http://goo.gl/L7NDe4">Barbados</a> in the east. Nevertheless, I found a convenient direct flight from Grenada to St. Lucia, and overall the puzzle came together. I was a little confused about how they would react to a passport from the evil country (especially since when transiting through the USA at the border they questioned me for a very long time and in detail), but as it turned out, in Grenada, and on all the other Caribbean islands, there was no tension in this regard. Grenada was also the first Caribbean country to lift all coronavirus entry restrictions.

On the way from New York I took a couple of photos of the British Virgin Islands.

Grenada airport is exceptional: there are no ATMs or money changers at all. But in theory, the minibus should accept cash US dollars. The owner of my AirBnB kindly met me in a car.

First of all, I went to St. George's, the capital of Grenada. It turned out to be a really big city by Caribbean standards, very picturesquely located on the hills. The main cathedral is on the hill.
<p/>

A man with dreadlocks gathered into a hat like a turban is a common sight in the Caribbean.

People in the Caribbean generally love dreadlocks.

<p>
For some reason, there were a lot of schoolchildren on the streets; they were clearly visible in their bright uniforms.

<p>
There is an English fort on a rock near the shore in the center of the city; a tunnel was made under the rock back in the 19th century.

There is a pier near the shore, where cruise ships come (due to the coronavirus, they come very rarely) and an adjacent shopping center.

<p>
And in the fort itself, something weird is happening. As I understand it, until recently it belonged to the local police, whose main office is still under the walls of the fort at the exit. But now it’s like a museum, there’s even a small entrance fee, but they didn’t have time to change anything, as a result, the premises are partially abandoned, and partially some people who seem to just live there hang out here.

In one of the rooms there was a gym for police officers, everything remained that way.

A memorial plaque stating that Maurice Bishop and his associates were shot here in 1983. In 1979, Bishop overthrew the previous right-wing dictator Gary and changed Grenada's political course to cooperation with Cuba and the USSR, which caused discontent among neighboring countries and, of course, the United States. At the same time, Bishop was not yet very radical and tried to somehow come to an agreement with the Americans, and in October 1983 he was overthrown and shot by representatives of the more radical wing of the Communist Party, after which the United States sent troops to Grenada and occupied it

The hotel is advertised for only 75 EC (less than $30), but it seems outdated because the price on the Internet is twice as high.

The menus of local bars are written with chalk on a blackboard. As you can see, the menu is modest and consists of sandwiches and wings.
<p/>

Bars generally look something like this, this is the main form of catering in the Caribbean.

Locals drink beer all the time; it is relatively inexpensive - about $1 per bottle, only slightly more expensive than Coca-Cola.

In Grenada, I rented a small studio near the airport (the capital was 10 kilometers away). It was in a small village on the slopes of a hill. In general, all of Grenada outside the capital consists of approximately such villages on the slopes, since the entire island is so hilly.

The decor is a bit retro, it was pretty much the same on other islands.
<p/>

I covered the entire distance between the airport and the capital on foot.

On the southern coast of the island behind the airport there is a local university campus.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52091267506_e22664f80c_o.jpg">
<p>
The campus is large and similar to American universities; I have not seen such large universities on other small Caribbean islands.

The university has several more buildings on the other side in the village of Grand Anse, and branded buses go there. I also rode on it, I thought it was an ordinary bus, but it turned out it was free, but in theory only for students, luckily I was not discovered. By the way, there were quite a few foreign students on campus and on the bus, which is also atypical for Caribbean countries (usually I was the only white person on the street).
<p/>

Grand Anse is also the most popular beach in Grenada, with several large hotels nearby.

Distances in Grenada are indicated in miles, just like in the UK. It is clear that many cities have French names, although France fought with England for the Caribbean islands already in the 18th century, since the 19th century the island was British.

There is also a large supermarket here. In all the Caribbean countries, I was shocked by the prices for fruits and vegetables, they are simply astronomical. Watermelon is almost three US dollars per kilogram (here, as in America, they weigh it in pounds).

This building sells apartments under the citizenship by investment program. Like some other Caribbean countries, Grenada sells its citizenship - you need to buy real estate for 400 thousand dollars (and not sell it for five years) or just pay 150 thousand dollars right away.
