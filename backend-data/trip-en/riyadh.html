<h1>Saudi Arabia: Damma, Riyadh, Jizan, Abha</h1>
<i>2-6 December 2022</i>
<h2>Dammam</h2>
<p>
The first city in Saudi Arabia that I visited was Dammam, the capital of the Eastern Province. This is the region where Saudi oil is produced, on the shores of the Persian Gulf, where other oil states are located - Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE. Dammam is a new city that will soon celebrate its centenary, and it grew up, of course, thanks to oil production.

<p>
Saudi Arabia is the most car-oriented country in the world, public transport has just begun to appear in recent years, all cities are built for cars, usually on a grid and with fairly wide streets.
<p/>

<p>
Nevertheless, walking on foot was, in principle, normal - there are sidewalks everywhere, and they are quite wide and empty, although traffic lights for pedestrians do not always work correctly.
<p/>

<p>
There were even benches near my hotel.

An interesting poster where a man and a woman look to a bright future where, judging by the picture, Saudi Arabia will have an overground metro and a hyperloop.

Also from the billboards, King Salman (right) and his son, Crown Prince, Prime Minister and de facto ruler Mohammed (left), are constantly leading into a bright future.

<p>
And from cars too. In general, although this is a car country, the city centers here are quite ordinary, with densely packed buildings.

Mosques in Saudi Arabia look unusually square for us - Ottoman style (like the Blue Mosque in Istanbul) or Persian (like in Iran and Uzbekistan) are more common.

Car license plates use Arabic letters, which are duplicated below with Latin ones, similar in sound or spelling (the second letter is similar in appearance to E, but it is a guttural sound; on the right is H, not J).

There are no human monuments at all in Saudi Arabia, apparently because local Islam (of the Hanbali school, also known as Wahhabism) strongly condemns the worship of “idols.” Instead, monuments to various objects are erected in all squares and crossroads, as in some Asian countries.

<h2>Riyadh</h2>
<p>
Riyadh is the capital and largest city of Saudi Arabia. Over the past 30 years, the population has grown 5 times, from 1.5 million to 7.5! And they expect to grow to 15, they plan to build the largest airport in the world there. Riyadh is located in the heart of the country, and is home to the Al Saud family, which gives the country its name.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52581055602_8fa26ab5b1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Riyadh is similar in layout to <a href="../uae">Dubai</a> - there is a small historical center, and a very long wide avenue (more precisely, two parallel ones), lined with skyscrapers and shopping centers, and surrounded by vast residential low-rise areas. The easiest way to see this is from the top of Kingdom Tower, which has an observation deck.
<p/>

They plan to rebuild the space between two major roads; there are many cleared areas.

<p>
Looking south, these are relatively older hotels and shopping centers, and not so high. Even further away there is the historical center, but it is not visible (the distance is quite large, about 10 km).
<p/>

A metro is being built in Riyadh, judging by the ground concourses being almost ready, the opening is coming soon (Wikipedia actually says that it is planned to open in 2022, but obviously they didn’t have time).

We move to the historical center. There is a small fort with a museum, from the capture of which the creation of Saudi Arabia began.

King Abdul Aziz first returned his ancestral lands in the Riyadh region, and then subjugated four regions: Najd (the center of the country with Riyadh), Hejaz (the Red Sea coast with Mecca and Medina), Asir (the southern part of the coast near the border with Yemen) and Al-Ahsa (the coast of the Persian Gulf), which made up Saudi Arabia.

Judging by the photographs, in the 1930s there was not much civilization here; oil had just been discovered.

<p>
Next to the fort is Deera Square, where the courthouse stands. It is famous for the fact that death sentences were previously carried out publicly on it. When I say before, I don't mean the 19th century, but before the 2010s. Now this practice seems to have stopped, and nothing in the square reminds of it.

Bus stop. Buses in Riyadh appeared only recently, there are 10 routes for the entire city. Payment with a transport card has already been made, but replenishing it is a problem, because I did not see a working terminal at any stop.

I thought about visiting this place, I arrived, no one understood what I wanted. Finally I found an English-speaking person, it turned out that you can visit, but you need to buy a ticket online for a certain time! A very strange approach, given the near-zero number of visitors, it is unlikely that they would crowd an entire abandoned city. Though, as it turned out, the only choice was before 6 pm and after 6 pm, but still I was unable to buy a ticket, since none of my cards worked (a typical situation in Saudi Arabia, all my online purchases were very difficult, and I had to juggle cards).

<h2>Jizan</h2>
<p>
From Riyadh I traveled south to the Asir region, one of the country's four historical regions, which was an independent emirate from 1916 to 1934. Asir is the only region of the country where the landscape is not desert, but forested mountains. Very close is the border with Yemen, where the nature is similar.

A mega-project is being built here - a huge port terminal.

It is interesting that the streets have already been paved, but the houses have not yet been built.

Jizan Airport. It is strange that the city seems to have two names - Jizan and Jazan. Moreover, this is not a problem of transliteration - Arabic also has two variants of spelling and pronunciation. As I understand it, Jazan is more often spoken in Arabic, but Jizan is used on most English maps.
<p/>

I booked a hotel right in a residential area near the airport and walked there.

Jizan has a hill fortress built during the Ottoman Empire. Here was almost the farthest outskirts of the empire - the vilayat of Yemen.
<p/>

There was no one in the fortress, only after 10 minutes the caretaker emerged from somewhere to say hello.

Instead of a pedestrian traffic light, sometimes there is a big speed bump here so that cars slow down.

<h2>Abha</h2>
<p>
The city of Abha is located in the mountains, thanks to that the climate is not as hot as in the rest of Saudi Arabia.

The road from Jizan most of the time goes along the plain, and then sharply rises for about two kilometers.

The hotel costs 80 rials (less than $25), it was the cheapest and at the same time the best hotel on this trip.

First of all, I went to the nearest mountain where there should be a cable car.

The cable car is here, but it is closed, apparently for renovation and reconstruction, like many tourist sites in Saudi Arabia.

<p>
The second attraction is a dam and a small lake, not far from the other end of the cable car (the stations are approximately on the same level, so I can't say that one is upper and one is lower). Due to the lack of a cable car, I took a taxi.
