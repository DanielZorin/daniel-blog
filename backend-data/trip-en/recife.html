<h1>Brazil: Salvador, Aracaju, Maceió, Recife, João Pessoa, Natal</h1>
<i>13-25 March 2021</i>
<h2>Salvador</h2>
<p>
Salvador was the first new city for me on this trip to Brazil. I got there at an extremely unfortunate time: in the state of Bahia there was a lockdown, which meant that everything was closed on weekends (but not on weekdays). In general, in Brazil, most stores are closed on weekends, and in the center of large cities it’s empty, but there’s also the problem of eating - while on Saturday there was still something open for takeaway, on Sunday only Subway was open. It was also forbidden to go outside from 8 pm to 5 am, but this is not a big deal, because sunset was at 6, and after that normal people do not go outside anyway. Due to the lockdown, the city was deserted. In the historical center there is a police presence on at least every square, but on the neighboring streets only homeless people sleep. Otherwise, the city is very beautiful, and on a weekday without a lockdown it should be lively and atmospheric.

<p>
Walking along the streets with tightly closed shop windows, near which only young people hanging out, was really uneasy. The first time I decided to take out my camera only when I reached one of the central squares. There wasn't much life there - a couple of souvenir vendors, ice cream sellers and a few police officers.
<p/>

Here is the top station of the Lacerda elevator, which connects the upper and lower city.
<p/>

<p>
The elevator was built in the 19th century and renovated in the 20th century in the Art Deco style.
<p/>

<p>
As you can see, the lower city consists mostly of boxes. There are only offices and shops in this part, so it is dangerous to go there on weekends.
<p/>

<p>
It is also extremely dangerous to try to go down or up on foot instead of the elevator - it is clear that closer to the hill there are completely destroyed buildings, mostly squats and slums. The elevator ride costs only 30 centavos (5 cents), and in the evening, when it is not working, you will have to spend money on a taxi.

Salvador is listed as a World Heritage Site due to its high concentration of colonial architecture and Baroque churches.

Salvador was the capital of Brazil during the first period of colonization, until it was moved to Rio de Janeiro.

Pelourinho Square, that is, the area of ​​the “pillory”, where criminals were chained. The entire old city area is also called Pelourinho.

Usually there is music played here and some street performances take place. On that day, only one newlywed couple was there, and with them were several musicians.

<p>
Salvador's airport is located far northeast of the city, but when flying from Recife, the plane for some reason decided to fly further south and turn around before landing, so the city center was visible through the windows.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255630973_6ea0197f3f_o.jpg">

<p>
Salvador stands on a pointed cape, but the historical center is not on the cape itself, but to the north.
<p/>

Behind the center there is simply a sea of ​​favelas on the hills.

There are two metro lines in Salvador, one of them ends in the center, and after a few stops the second one separates from it, going to the airport.

<p>
Much of the route goes through favelas. The local favelas are similar to Rio de Janeiro because the city also has a lot of steep hills.

Although the historical center is not on the cape, I couldn’t help but go and see what was there on the edge. Of course there are a couple of Portuguese forts there.

Suddenly a noisy crowd and several cars with loudspeakers arrived. The Brazilian national anthem was playing. It turned out to be a rally of supporters of President Bolsonaro against the lockdown, which began a couple of hours earlier in the square under the windows of my hotel.

<h2>Aracaju</h2>
<p>
To the north of the huge Bahia, a chain of small states begins, the first of which is called Sergipe.
<p/>

<p>
Once we crossed the Sergipe border, the road got worse. Most of the time it was a two-lane road, like in Russia, only closer to the capital it became wider. The landscapes in this state are hilly, but not that tropical.

The state capital is called Aracaju. I checked into a motel directly opposite the bus station on the outskirts, and from there I immediately went to the neighboring town (which will be discussed later). View from my window of the outskirts of Aracaju.

<h2>Maceió</h2>
<p>
The next state to the north is called Alagoas and its capital is Maceió. When I was in Brazil last time, Maceió was in first place in Brazil in terms of crime, but now it’s closer to the end of the top ten.

In the middle of it all is the bus station. There are several hotels near the bus station that are not listed on booking.com, which is not surprising, since they are all in favelas. In Maceió, I decided to do the opposite of what I did in the previous city and settle in the beach area. In the end, I didn’t even go to the historical center of the city, since the beach turned out to be better, and there are no outstanding beauties in the center.

This was also facilitated by the absence of a lockdown in the state of Alagoas. While everything was closed in Salvador, here you could go to a restaurant at 8 pm. We ended up at rodizio - this is a restaurant where you pay an entrance fee (45 reais = less than $10), and then there is not only a free self-service buffet, but also pieces of fried meat are constantly being carried around the hall. This restaurant format is found throughout Brazil, but not very often (and seems to be more common in the south). Later, in the capital of Brazil, I could not find an unlimited rodizio, I only found two, one was too expensive (160 reais), and the second was closed.

<h2>Recife</h2>
<p>
The day after my arrival in Recife, the “lockdown” began. It was possible to walk the streets, but non-food stores and restaurants were closed. More precisely, it seemed to be written in the news that restaurants would not be open, but in fact they were open for takeout, including trucks selling food (which always seem to be open for takeout). That, and having a full kitchen in a fancy two-bedroom apartment in a good area that I rented for less than $20 a day, made for a good time, although the closure of the beaches was a bit of a bummer.
<p/>

Recife is one of the largest cities in Brazil, stretching along the coastline for tens of kilometers. Tourists are primarily interested in two places: the historical center and the beach area of ​​Boa Viagem (which means “Have a nice trip!”). Boa Viagem is also the location of Recife airport, which took me about 20 minutes to walk or take a taxi for 5-6 reais. I took the metro to the center and to the bus station from the Airport station. In theory, I was supposed to have one flight from Recife airport, but at the last moment my flight to Salvador was canceled, and instead of a direct flight, I flew with a short transfer in Recife, so I got to see a lot of the city from above.

Measures to combat coronavirus in Brazil are aimed mainly at increasing the number of infections, rather than reducing it. Beaches where people sit outdoors and far from each other are closed so that they can only gather with friends at home. They close stores at 5 pm so that more people gather there, when everyone wants to make it before closing. They suggest running in the heat wearing a mask so that your immunity is as low as possible.

After waiting out the weekend, I reached the city center of Recife. Going there on weekends is completely suicidal; weekdays during the lockdown were still better - there were quite a few people on the streets, and some of the shops were open (although in theory they shouldn’t have been). It was still uncomfortable to walk around, and I became a witness to a robbery, well, at least not a victim.

Recife belonged to the Netherlands for several decades in the first half of the 17th century, but then the Portuguese recaptured all Dutch possessions. From this period, however, what remains is the general plan and a pair of fortresses in the city center.

The center of Recife consists of two parts: the oldest part on the island, and the newer part on the mainland, where the station, metro, government buildings and most of the commerce are. In the newer part, however, there are also a lot of different churches and colorful houses.

<h2>João Pessoa</h2>

Many who have been to Portugal have probably traveled to Cape Roca - the westernmost point of Europe. In Brazil, I visited its sister city on the other side - the easternmost point of America, located on the outskirts of the city of João Pessoa.

João Pessoa is named after the governor of the state of Paraiba in 1928-1930. He was killed shortly before the revolution of 1930, and after the victory of the revolution and the establishment of the Getúlio Vargas regime, he became a kind of sacred victim, a fallen hero. Until 1930, the city was called the same as the state - Paraiba.

<h2>Natal</h2>
<p>
The city of Natal (the capital of the state of Rio Grande do Norte) is statistically one of the most dangerous places in Brazil and in the world - in 2019 it had the third highest number of murders in Brazil (and first among state capitals); the state as a whole ranks first in Brazil. In general, I have been to several cities that have higher murder rates: <a href="http://goo.gl/skQ8ZT">Tijuana</a>, <a href="http://goo.gl/RFVwWJ ">Cuernavaca</a> and <a href="http://goo.gl/5s4lCj">Acapulco</a> (Mexico), <a href="http://goo.gl/uMEDaE">San Juan</a> and <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/558997.html">St. Louis</a> (USA). The number of murders does not always correlate with the danger of walking around the city, since murders are most often the consequences of conflicts between criminal groups, and not a random street crime such as phone theft. Nevertheless, in Brazil I used increased precautions - I took some photographs with my phone instead of a DSLR (before the trip I bought a new phone with a fairly good camera), did not walk the streets after sunset, and avoided long walks through residential areas.

The busy central streets are mostly shopping. I was in Natal on the last day before the lockdown began and the shops were still open.

Paved street. There are no shops in this part of the city and it is already noticeably uncomfortable to be there.

Here 80% of the houses look abandoned. In some, however, there are some kind of workshops.

According to the guidebook, this street should be famous for its many bars. Of course, I didn’t expect that the bars would be open during the day, but in my opinion everything here is closed seriously and for a long time.

An enchanting church, covered on all sides with square tiles of dirty brown color, which are usually used to decorate public toilets.

From here I took a taxi to the bridge. In Brazil I traveled a lot by taxi, probably more than in all 30 years of my life in Russia. Not only for safety reasons, but also because it’s cheap: a trip around the city, if not very far, costs 7-12 reais (except for Sao Paulo, it’s more expensive there), and a bus ticket costs more than 4, that is, for two people it's only slightly more expensive by taxi.

There is also a beach here, although it is not the main beach of Natal - there is also a large beach in the south, perhaps as good as in Maceió.

On the other side you can see a white stripe - this is a Portuguese fort. It was closed for renovations, so I decided not to go there (especially since it’s too far on foot, since the bridge cuts off this piece of the coast from everything else.

The beach goes far to the north, and it is quite deserted - this is a remote part of the city.

Interestingly, in the northeast of Brazil there are collective taxis, just like in Central Asia and some regions of Russia (such as Altai). Drivers hang out at bus stations. Perhaps this is due to the fact that there are somehow very few regular buses, for example, there is nothing at all from Natal to the south after lunch. And there are also posters at bus stations urging people not to use collective taxis - here they are called “secret transport”.
