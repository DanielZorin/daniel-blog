<h1>Thailand: Bangkok</h1>
<i>6-8, 24-30 September, 11-17 November 2015, 17-21 February 2016</i>
<h2>Bangkok</h2>
<p>
Khao San Road is the most legendary place in Bangkok. Yes, cheap accommodation in Bangkok can be found not only here, and food even more so. Yes, transport accessibility to Khaosan is not ideal, because the metro is far away. Yes, it is difficult to catch a taxi here due to the increased concentration of bad taxi drivers. And you can’t catch tuk-tuks at all. But it has its own atmosphere, and I’ve already found where to live cheaply and where to eat deliciously, having fished out everything I needed from the ocean of tourist destinations. So now, returning to Bangkok, I can safely go to Khaosan - I feel comfortable there.
<p/>

<p>
And it all started like this. In September 2015, I came to Bangkok for the first time from Cambodia for just one day, to fly from there to Moscow. The journey took the whole day, closer to midnight I arrived at the Mo Chit bus station, it took me a long time to get from there to the metro, then near the metro they brazenly offered me a taxi for 500 baht ($17 - drive 4 kilometers at night without traffic jams), I made a deal at the next corner with a tuk-tukk for 100 (I overpaid, of course - the real price for a taxi to the metro according to the meter is about 60, if there are no traffic jams). On Khao San, I checked into the first hotel I came across for only 200 baht ($6). It was a hasty decision, dictated by fatigue after the journey. Then I had not yet seen the film “The Beach” with Leonardo DiCaprio, the action of which begins with the main character checking into approximately the same hotel. The “hotel” was very bad - an uncomfortable hard bed, a terrible fan: if you turn it on, there is a risk of catching a cold at night, and if you turn it off, it’s terrible heat. The wooden walls do not reach the ceiling, so audibility is excellent - not loud sex from neighboring rooms, but music on the street, which plays until 3-4 am. Imagine that you are trying to fall asleep at a disco. One good thing about this hotel was that the Internet was very fast.
The next day in the morning I moved to the Orchid Guesthouse hotel on parallel Rambutri Street. For 350 baht, the conditions there are immeasurably better - normal furniture, there is air conditioning. Though, it’s also a bit noisy.
<p/>

<p>
On my second visit to Bangkok, I tested the Kawin Place Hotel in a side street off Khao San. I then stayed in this hotel, and in this same room H305 for 400 baht, twice more. An important advantage of this room is that it has no windows, which means that the music does not interfere with sleep at night, it rumbles somewhere in the distance.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256637849_57a7dc9c09_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Since it was impossible to fall asleep on the first night, I walked around Khaosan until 3 am, and at the same time bought food and ice cream at 7-11. In Bangkok, people generally walk slowly (much slower than in Moscow), but on Khao San the speed is simply a snail’s pace, because you need to walk along a narrow passage between shops and restaurants in a crowd of people.
<p/>

<p>
It looks something like this. By the way, at about two in the morning, rather unattractive prostitutes crawl out onto the street in the area of the noisiest bars. If you walk alone, they grab you right by the hands - even in Pattaya they didn’t do this to me.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255879876_55fa9c240a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
What are they selling here? Typical souvenirs from Khaosan are bracelets with vulgar inscriptions like “I love sucking dicks” or “I love wet pussies.”
<p/>

<p>
Flags of all countries of the world, including obscure ones. Backpackers love to sew the flags of the countries they visit onto their backpacks. Usually, when you see a person with these flags, there are 10-15 of them. If I decided to sew flags onto my backpack, there would most likely not be enough space on it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255880556_c0e6f97926_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And the flags would cost me about $70.

These are branded Khaosan products - fake documents. For 10 dollars you can buy an AIESEC student card, which in some places gives discounts in museums. You can buy a driver's license from the state of Illinois, which will give you access to motorcycle or car rental. If you talk to sellers, you can even agree to buy a passport of some decent EU country (lost by the real owner). It is better not to travel to developed countries with such a passport, but in principle it is possible to travel to all sorts of banana republics.
<p/>

<p>
There are also barkers on Khao San offering to buy a suit. Why backpackers need a suit is unclear.
<p/>

<p>
Local travel agencies sell bus tickets. These buses depart from Khao San, and this is their only convenience - you do not need to go to the bus station (although the city bus costs only 6.5 baht). If you look closely at the prices, you will notice some strange things. For example, a ticket to Sukhothai costs 400 baht (5-6 hours drive), and to Chiang Mai - 350, although Chiang Mai is twice as far along the same road. From the bus station you can get to Sukhothai for 300 baht, and to Chiang Mai for 600-700 baht. However, you will not meet a single Thai among the passengers on this bus, although it would seem such a lucrative offer. It’s just that the bus will take twice as long as usual, will stop at very expensive restaurants along the way, and at the end will drop everyone off 20 kilometers from the city, from where you can only leave by taxi for 500 baht, so the bus owners will get their money in full, and you travel will cost more than on a regular bus. In the worst case, something from your luggage will be stolen at night.
For comparison, a ticket to Pattaya here costs 350 baht, and on a minibus from the Victory Monument - about 90 (a bus from the bus station will be even cheaper, 60 baht, but it takes a long time to get there, and then it’s also a long drive). You can estimate the margin of the tourism business.
The moral is simple - DO NOT use the services of travel agencies from Khao San. It would seem like obvious advice, written as the first line in any guidebook, but there's no shortage of clients, especially frpm Western countries, where people are gullible and not accustomed to scams.

<p>
And these people also manage to get drunk in establishments on Khao San. I physically can't be there because I'm afraid my ears will burst from the loud sound.

<p>
By morning, Khao San is transformed. If you get up at 6 am, you can see how they are cleaning. There are even cars driving here during the day.

<p>
Now I’ll tell you what you can eat here. Khao San is packed with European food establishments catering to tourists. If you are nostalgic for it, then it will suit you. For example, breakfast is offered for 80 baht. I am not a fan of such breakfasts, so I would prefer to eat a hearty meal in a Thai canteen for the same amount.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255160907_56393df18f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Menu of some establishment. Tom Yam costs 120 baht - almost $4. Not cheap.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256091853_b6b7923919_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But the same tom yam is half the price - in the Buck Siew establishment.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255152232_b7027bbf5b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There, Tom Kha Gai soup, which I like better than Tom Yam, is even cheaper.
<p/>

<p>
Khao San has McDonald's, KFC and Burger King. In Thailand, prices at these establishments may vary depending on the location in the city. All prices in Khao San are high.
<p/>

<p>
Insects are sold for the entertainment of tourists. 10 baht per photo, 30 per sample.
<p/>

<p>
It’s better not to buy fruits on Khao San - the prices are 5 times higher. There are a couple of supermarkets around the corner, where the prices are normal, but the best place is at the market across the river.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255880466_e74802b5a7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Where to eat? You can go further away from Khao San - to the university canteen, across the river, to the national stadium or to Chinatown, I will tell you about all these places later. If you don’t want to go anywhere far, then there are also options. Firstly, Pad Thai, which is sold from carts for 30-35 baht, is very good. Secondly, just around the corner from Khao San there is an authentic Thai eatery with an authentic menu and low prices. I don't know what it's called. The sign looks like this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256932915_8f2cf218a1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Getting there is easy: from the western edge of Khaosan we turn north and walk literally a couple of blocks, this canteen is on the eastern side of the street (and the aforementioned slightly more expensive Buck Siew is almost opposite). Here is the menu, as you can see, prices for dishes with meat range from 30 to 45 baht ($0.9-$1.3). Some of the prices are even written in fractions, as in most authentic canteens where the menu is only in Thai. I still don’t understand what this fraction means; in fact, you always pay the price on the right.

<p>
Om-Nom-nom! I love Thai canteens, they seem to have about the same soups everywhere, but the taste is always different, but everywhere it’s delicious (if it’s not made from liver). In every small town, during a layover, I consider it my duty to go and have lunch from the local grandmothers.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256636314_cf37d437c1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
If you want to spice things up, you can get grilled meat from these guys. The name is Pook Bank Steak, they even have a Facebook page. They stand in the square at the end of Rambutri Street, where Khaosan buses still leave, but not every day.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255157477_539fdf39fe_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are 7-11 stores in this square to grab a drink, and there is a lot of good grill around.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256929750_e774f7b724_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are grilled skewers for 10 baht, and there are squid on sticks.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256088473_06080765ff_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Back to the steaks. This is what they look like.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256929655_db8ad6aed3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The most expensive one costs 160 baht, but there are cheaper ones. I definitely recommend this place.

Although Khao San has almost all the joys of life, it is also worth to walk around, because Bangkok is one of the most interesting cities in the region. Unlike many Asian cities, Bangkok has more than just 21st century architecture. Bangkok is diverse. Although Khaosan Road is far from the metro, its location is very advantageous - right in the historical center of the city (and the metro only passes through the business center with skyscrapers).
<p/>

<p>
In short, before Bangkok, the capital of Thailand (more precisely, Siam) was in the city of Ayutthaya, which is a couple of hours drive to the north, but in the middle of the 18th century, the Burmese attacked the Thais and burned Ayutthaya, then a new capital was founded downstream. The creator of the new Siam, King Taksin, based himself on the opposite side of the river and united back many of the lands of the collapsed state, but was then overthrown by a group of conspirators. One of the generals quickly returned from Cambodia, restored order, suppressed all the rebels, and then executed the deposed king and himself founded a new dynasty, which still rules, and moved the capital across the river, building a new palace.

<p>
In the second half of the 19th century, Westernization came to Thailand (as in Russia under Peter I), thanks to which in some cities you can now see palaces and villas, like those of European lords. The government quarter of Bangkok resembles St. Petersburg, repainted in warm colors.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256923320_8715256716_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Rivers and canals also exist in large quantities.

<p>
I haven’t been to the royal palace - entrance is a bit expensive (500 baht = $17). I walked around it outside many times, making a circle around the markets near the embankment.

<p>
You can buy a bunch of coins right there for 20 baht. I wonder if the total on the plate is more than 20 baht or less? There are coins of 25 and 50 satang (there are simply no smaller ones).

In the center of Bangkok there are generally many temples that are unusual for Thailand. Most temples in Thailand are the same and look like this from the outside, differing only in the color of the roof - red or green.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255157262_f6dcdd3b97_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But this particular temple is interesting because there is a grandiose painting on the walls inside.

There is a giant swing near this temple. The point is to swing on them so as to grab a bag of coins placed at a height. However, these entertainments were stopped in 1935 for security reasons.

There is a giant Democracy Monument near Khao San Road at a roundabout. Interestingly, the monument was erected by the junta that carried out a coup in the 1930s, overthrowing King Rama VII and establishing a constitutional monarchy. In reality, the country was not at all ready for democracy at that time, since it consisted almost entirely of illiterate peasants. Now, however, this place is a traditional place for showdowns between supporters of different political forces, such as the “Red Shirts” (supporters of Thaksin Shinawatra, Prime Minister 2000-2006, now living somewhere in London; mainly the poor, greedy for populist slogans) and "Yellow Shirts" (supporters of the 2006 junta and sovereign vertical democracy).

By the way, Bangkok is a short colloquial name for the city, which was originally used only by foreigners. Officially, the capital of Thailand is called Krung Thep Mahanakhon Amon Rattanakosin Mahintarayutthaya Mahadilok Phop Nopparat Ratchathani Burirom Udomratchaniwet Mahasathan Amon Piman Avatan Sathit Sakkathattiya Witsanukam Prasit, or Krungthep for short (as it will be written, for example, on the windshield of a bus).

<p>
There is also plenty to do on the other side of the Chao Phraya River. The first time I went there was by bus directly from Khaosan to see the floating market.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256088568_68ad9ddda0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This market is not particularly impressive; for example, a dozen boats are moored to the pier. The water, oddly enough, is quite clean.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255157817_c0ef464d14_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Fruits. At the pier itself there is more choice and lower prices. There are skewers for 10 baht, for example.

On one of the streets they were building either a new metro line or an overpass. Downstairs they were selling amazingly delicious grilled chicken.
<p/>

The setting of this canteen is very simple. Five points for the chicken.

In this part of the city you can find songthaews - Thai minibuses converted from pickup trucks. In the city center there are only buses and taxis, or brand new air-conditioned minibuses that go to the suburbs.

Here is one of the most famous attractions of Bangkok - the Temple of the Dawn (Wat Arun). Unfortunately, all the times that I was in Bangkok from September 2015 to February 2016 it was under restoration.

In addition to buses across the bridges, you can cross the river by ferries for just 3 baht ($0.10) from one of the piers.

The closest pier to Khaosan is right behind the university, where, by the way, you can eat inexpensively in the student canteen.

Bridge named after King Rama VIII, the elder brother of the last king. Rama VIII was king during World War II, when Thailand fought on the side of the Axis powers, although the king himself was too young to influence anything. A year after the end of the war, he was shot dead in the palace under strange circumstances, which are forbidden to discuss in Thailand.

There are still public boats on the river for about 10 baht, but I have never traveled on them along this route, I only went deep into the city along the canal.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256635989_aa94b9c3f1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I often went to the other side of the river because there is a cheap market closest to Khao San. Yes, there is also Chinatown, but it’s more expensive there, and you can either go there by bus in circles or walk for 45 minutes, and getting to the Wang Lang market is faster and more fun.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256931050_43eba8beb9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
For the cheapest fruit you will have to walk another 10 minutes from the pier, but it is worth it.

And two rows to the left of the pier they sell my absolute favorite - sushi for 5 baht ($0.15).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256932875_59ba0a5e54_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In Moscow, one piece costs 70-90 rubles, previously it was as much as $2 - a completely inadequate price. In Thailand, you can buy a whole box of sushi to fill up on it.

“Everything could have been different if it weren’t for these terrible traffic jams” - this Zemfira's song could be the anthem of Bangkok. Once I was traveling through Bangkok in transit from Korat to Nakhon Pathom, I just had to drive from one bus station to another. At the entrance to the northern bus station, the bus, as usual, was stuck in a traffic jam, and through the window I somehow photographed one of the most beautiful sunsets I have seen in Asia in the gap between the houses.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255887861_d190ebe8b5_h.jpg"/>

Bangkok traffic jams can be photographed endlessly, especially since they exist at any time of the day.
<p/>

Bangkok has many flyovers and skywalks, but it can hardly be called a science fiction city like <a href="../chongqing">Chongqing</a> or <a href="../shanghai">Shanghai</a>. More like the cyberpunk backwaters of <a href="../hong-kong2015">Hong Kong</a>

The metro also runs on overpasses. There is one underground line, but I have never been on it, because it passes through all sorts of residential areas, touching only the train station among the interesting places.

<p>
The metro is useful mainly because it can take you to the airport. You can also move around inside the business center. It is better to go to the northern bus station by bus, because from the metro you will have to make a huge detour on foot along roads not equipped for pedestrians.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256082663_ae6615a323_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In general, I rarely took the metro, preferring buses for 6.50 baht (metro starts at ~20 for the shortest distances). The man on the left in a white shirt is the conductor. He has in his hands a sort of opening tube containing coins for change. The format of tickets is very similar to tickets in the Russian provinces.
<p/>

Bus stops look like this. Thanks for the list of routes. You can also find out the number you need using Google maps.
<p/>

<p>
You can also travel around Bangkok almost free on long-distance trains. To DMK airport (former main airport, now more low-cost) costs 3 baht.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256636534_5bf684ef8a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are also public boats on the canal. From Khaosan you can get to the business center by them, although you will have to walk about 15 minutes to the station; the bus stop is closer. But no traffic jams.

The Victory Monument is one of the main transport junctions of the capital. Around this square, in various nooks and crannies, there are minibuses that take you to cities near Bangkok, for example, Pattaya, Ayutthaya or Nakhon Pathom.

I do not recommend buying electronics in Thailand. It seems that the Chinese sell everything of high quality in Shanghai, and send the second grade to Thailand. Everything I bought in Thailand lasted relatively short. It's better to go to Shanghai or Kuala Lumpur.

There are several places where entertainment is concentrated: along Sukhumvit Avenue - Nana Plaza and Soi Cowboy, and in the Silom area - Patpong Street.
