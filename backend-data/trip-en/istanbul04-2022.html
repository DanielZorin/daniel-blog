<h2>Istanbul</h2>
<p>
During my trip to Istanbul, I accomplished a surprising amount in one day.

I arrived at Sabiha airport, took a coronavirus test, and decided, for fun and a little savings, to go to the center by city bus   ferry. Kadikoy pier.

Maybe I could get there faster by metro via Taksim, but it wouldn’t be as pleasant.

Finally good weather, I couldn't wait for it in March.

I checked into a hotel, bought adapters for American sockets at the market (I had to run around looking for them) and, having exchanged the Kazakh money I had left since March for lira, I decided to go for a walk around Istanbul. I already had a pass to all museums in Turkey, which costs 60 liras for the year (residents only), so I finally decided to go to the Galata Tower.

In principle, there is nothing particularly interesting inside, but it is an excellent observation deck, it's hard to find analogues “on the ground”.

People were picnicking on all the lawns. As I understand it, this was due to the fact that it was Ramadan, so everyone was waiting for sunset so they could eat.
