<h1>Russia: Kaluga</h1>
<i>21 April 2013</i>
<h2>Kaluga</h2>
<p>
Those coming from Moscow may not understand how Kaluga can exist if salaries there are about 20-25 thousand rubles, and prices are the same as in Moscow (except for prices for buses and apartment rentals). This is all because in Moscow people have forgotten how to count money and save, while there are plenty of opportunities to buy something at an inflated price.

Every city should have a reason to be proud, otherwise it is not a proper city. Tsiolkovsky lived in Kaluga, so there is a cosmonautics museum, a planetarium, and monuments to Tsiolkovsky himself, Korolev and Gagarin.

Near the entrance to the planetarium there is a fancy touch screen, like in tourist information offices in Europe. And this is correct, the Kaluga region is no worse than any average region in Germany, only its transport accessibility is worse and its PR is weaker.

The installation of monuments in Kaluga is sponsored by Fora Bank.

And the installation of bins is supported by a draft beer store.

It is interesting that on local signs from different eras they write not just “Lenin Street”, but “Lenin name Street”.

The tradition is interrupted by modern signs. It is also worth paying attention to the Tricolor-TV plate, which I have never seen in Moscow, but which hangs on every second house in regional centers.

Amazing, incredible greetings from the nineties. Two men standing near folding chairs are currency traders, they change dollars.

Unpainted, but with a relief pattern. I wonder if it’s possible to climb up this way?
