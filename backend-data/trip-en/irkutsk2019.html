<h1>Russia: Irkutsk</h1>
<i>24-25 June 2019</i>
<h2>Irkutsk</h2>
<p>
On the way from Seoul to Moscow, I had a long layover in Irkutsk. The transfer was in the evening and at night, so it was impossible to go to Baikal, and I stopped for the night in the center of Irkutsk, where I had previously been <a href="../baikal">in the winter of 2015</a> .

<p>
But I still saw Baikal - from the airplane.

Russia always looks dark, dark green from an airplane.

We are approaching the Angara. Unfortunately, the historical center remains on the right side of the plane.

There are two buildings at the airport in Irkutsk. Newer and more decent is the terminal for domestic flights.
<p/>

<p>
Old and terribly cramped inside, without renovation for about 50 years is the terminal for international flights.

I checked into a hotel right on Uritsky Street, but it turned out that it had all been dug up for renovations, so there wasn’t much walking around.

Russia! It's cold outside, about  20, but the girls wear miniskirts.

There was little time, but I managed to walk through the main places in the center. Irkutsk is beautiful and respectable.

Irkutsk lacks the rules for placing signs like Moscow. Many buildings have tall signs.

Monument to the Coward, the Dunce and the Experienced (villains from Soviet comedy movies).

Irkutsk is one of the most visited cities by foreigners. The signs are duplicated in English.

When I’m in the regions, I often order sushi delivery - it’s two times cheaper than in Moscow.

Irkutsk is full of wooden architecture. And not only on the tourist street with souvenirs.

In the neighboring blocks, if you walk along the smaller streets, you can see a lot of things.
