<h1>Russia: Vladivostok, Artyom, Birobidzhan, Khabarovsk</h1>
<i>1-6 April 2014</i>
<h2>Artyom</h2>
<p>
From Vladivostok airport you can get to the city by train for 200 rubles or by bus for about 70. Both do not run very often. The trip to the end of the world, which I had wanted to do for so long, started lightly, since my luggage was promised to be delivered only the next day, so I took the bus, which runs every 20 minutes to the center of the city of Artyom, where the airport is located. From there it is not difficult to go to Vladivostok, since all intercity buses in Primorye pass through Artyom.
Artyom turned out to be an ordinary Russian provincial town, so I immediately felt the feeling of traveling around the Motherland that had been forgotten for six months.

<p>
Apart from the funny name (and it was named after a communist figure who had the pseudonym “Comrade Artyom”), there is nothing special in the city. Monument to Artyom.
<p/>

<p>
Although no, there are two monuments to Lenin here, for such a small city! One is white.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256877015_e33bf9d150_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The other is grey. Two cheerful Lenins.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256876690_8cbbd63d99_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Not far from one of the monuments to Lenin, they tried to offer me a book of Mormons in a purely American accent.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255833656_a33d338ae3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I discovered a couple of new glass buildings in the city.
<p/>

<p>

<p/>

<p>
New positive buses.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256581759_7b26af0fbe_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are also guest workers in the Far East. Then, when I flew between Khabarovsk and Sakhalin, I was amazed that half of the passengers there were from Central Asia. In Artem there is friendship of peoples - Russia, Korea, Tatarstan, Tajikistan, Germany and Armenia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256876565_c7183d0428_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Well, the Caucasus, of course.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255103707_8434c26e89_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The usual Artyom street sign.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256581644_7a82df4bb5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I admired the Artyom river a little.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255104107_e0d80251a4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And left for Vladivostok.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255833491_a27b5d844e_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Vladivostok</h2>
<p>
Russian lurkmore claims the following: “<i>The main and practically the only attraction of Vladivostok is Zelenka - the car market on the Green (nee Rotten) corner</i>.” That's where I went. I don’t know enough about cars that I can’t even distinguish companies by their logos (only if the name is signed with words), and I’ve never been to car markets in Moscow.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256471899_66709cec78_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Green Corner is located on one of the most distant residential outskirts of Vladivostok.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256767030_4c35ca4a8e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
To get there, you need to overcome certain obstacles.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256471544_b34c3a55ee_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a road sign to the market, and a pipe serves as the gate.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256767450_502df855ae_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Car trading goes something like this: a car is parked, and on the windshield the price, characteristics and telephone number (not always) are written in white putty.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255925513_fc394d0a5e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are two main characteristics of cars: year of manufacture and mileage. Most used cars are from Japan, where cars are written off quickly, after 2-3 years maximum. If it says "without mileage", it means that there is no mileage in Russia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255925793_d238da1795_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The vast majority of sellers are not random people, but professional car importers from Japan to Russia who sell many cars at once.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256767420_f783e54a81_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Apparently, the most convenient places on the sites are behind the fences, and those who have one car park it by the side of the road.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256767385_8bcc5d6481_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Main street of the market.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256471599_029e43ff31_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In addition to cars, here you can buy goods brought from Japan: alcohol, all sorts of Japanese snacks and candies, small household items. They sell from folding trays.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256767145_f610cfc332_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a whole department with special equipment where you can buy an asphalt paver or a tow truck.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256767160_2119dc141a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The market is like a labyrinth; the transitions between its parts can be quite original.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256471839_9d40af3223_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At the very top there was an abandoned toilet.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254993052_75a6c46bb5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And a couple of broken cars. And also a pack of dogs that I didn’t dare pass by.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254993077_61b7b74c5b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I wonder if I want to buy a car that is parked here in the middle, how will they get it from there? Will they pave the path with the help of tow trucks?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254992882_5ab7cb2cc7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Usually the transitions are wider.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255925703_208fafe772_h.jpg"/>
<p>
For tourists, Green Corner is valuable primarily for its stunning views of the hills filled with cars.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256767240_023e50c49b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
So this place can rightfully be considered one of the sights of Vladivostok.
<p/>

<p>
Vladivostok is epic, first of all, because it is more than 9,000 kilometers from Moscow (if you travel by rail) and for most residents of western Russia it symbolizes, together with Kamchatka and Chukotka, the end of the world. People usually don’t go here on tours, so the vast majority of people have never been to these parts and know about them only by hearsay.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257603534_7be6f332e8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The southern edge of Vladivostok, where the land ends and the sea begins, is located on the Egersheld Peninsula, some distance from the historical center. Lenin shows the way there (and further to Japan).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256129742_3fa7f1c7f3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The railway runs parallel to the road for a long time, ending at a freight train station located next to the port and docks.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254992322_a9fce17c74_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The area here is not the most prestigious.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254992427_a7d7254720_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On one of the streets there is a destroyed tower.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257603709_ae80903ca5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It burned out from the inside. I won’t show you what’s on the floor because there’s a huge pile of garbage there. Judging by Yandex panoramas, the tower has been standing in this form for several years.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255925068_afa57f706b_h.jpg"/>

Original installation on the house.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255925128_33057b6a86_h.jpg"/>
<p>
From here you can see all the splendor and poverty of Vladivostok, and Russia as a whole. In the background is a grandiose bridge to Russky Island, in the foreground is some kind of shack.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256471269_56a968ef54_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is the end of the world.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255721761_b4e057f779_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Around this bend is a lighthouse, which is so small (next to it is a radio tower 10 times higher) that I didn’t even take a picture of it. A street with the wonderful name Lukomorye goes in the other direction, which in fact turned out to be a cottage village behind a barrier.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255722256_9a02936144_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Lukomorye is a place from fairy tales, so the artists drew the knights that are associated with this tale.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256766510_d1292ae659_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The drawings on the walls in Vladivostok are on point.

Smoking cigarettes means harming yourself.

A wall of stars on which you can immediately identify Lennon, Jagger, Marilyn Monroe, Shevchuk, Kobzon, Tsoi and Dima Bilan.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254992302_070e83aded_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Sometimes the roofs are also painted.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256472049_66e19fec29_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And the walls of houses.

<p>
The second contender for the title of the edge of the world is the notorious Russky Island, where the APEC summit took place. APEC is some kind of leftist organization, the significance of which is very doubtful, but Putin decided to coincide the summit with a general reconstruction of Vladivostok and the creation of bridges. The plans include turning Russky Island into New Vasyuki with skyscrapers, but so far there are only a few villages where in the summer residents of Vladivostok go to lie on the beach on the seashore.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255722406_b3ef86519d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the spring the forest looks like this, but in the summer, when it is green, the landscape is completely atypical for Russia and is more reminiscent of the tropics.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255925298_dd2cea4a56_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The only large object on the island at the moment is the building where the summit took place. Now the Far Eastern Federal University has moved there. According to Russian tradition, you can’t get inside without a pass, and you can’t even walk around the territory here, because the guards are stationed at the outer gate.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256471384_4588ba6d5d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You can only gaze at the bridge from afar. The names of the local bays are romantic - Ulysses, Patroclus, Diomede, Ajax, Paris.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256766875_39d6f4882b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
By the way, not two bridges were built, but three. The third, not as high as the two most famous, is located on the outskirts and shortens the detour of the Amur Bay. You can see it if you arrive to Vladivostok by train.
<p/>

Probably the most important stereotype about the Far East is that only Chinese live there, and will soon hold a referendum and separate from Russia. In fact, I saw the Chinese only in the market near the bus station, however, you can also see the Chinese in Moscow markets. This is not the flavor of Vladivostok.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256767480_af06f7bb7d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
According to statistics, Vladivostok has the largest number of cars per capita in Russia. The easiest way to understand this is to try walking around the city. The traffic lights here are set up roughly like this: pedestrians are on red for two minutes, green for 15 seconds. The city's topography is also not conducive to walking.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255926133_163fa881b3_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255924448_34518a876d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The roads are in much better condition than the sidewalks.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256471159_d681964443_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And in some places there are no sidewalks at all.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256472164_f27145e294_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Analogue of Southern Butovo, <a href="../vyborg">Rybatsky</a>, <a href="../kyiv">Troeshchina</a> and similar areas in Vladivostok is called Cape Churkin. Now this area is practically in the center of the city, since the Golden Bridge was built exactly there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256472009_216d0b15ad_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Previously, you had to go there around the Golden Horn Bay. Or take a ferry.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256767525_e201427d28_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Vladivostok is indeed somewhat similar to <a href="../istanbul">Istanbul</a>, both on the map and on the panorama, so the names “Golden Horn” and "Bosphorus" are here for a reason.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255926003_1bb43ff696_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256471469_56ae1deb33_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is even a multi-colored staircase, just like in Istanbul!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256470804_564029e5f8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here you understand well what the words “Where the rails came out of the country’s pocket” meant.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255721671_c064f7fcf9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The station, by the way, was built similar to the Yaroslavl station, located at the other end of the road.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256766135_635ee1e81c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Public transport in Vladivostok is represented by a tram, which is more dead than alive, buses and a funicular. A characteristic feature of the buses is that they are slightly smaller than all those written off from Korea, and you have to pay at the exit, as in <a href="../odessa">Odessa</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256766375_3f476e7dd5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The funicular costs a ridiculous 9 rubles. It’s also interesting that in the 90s, public transport in Vladivostok was completely free.
<p/>

<p>
Signs in English have been posted in the city center. By the way, there are foreign tourists, even organized groups.

<p>
Vladivostok does not have many brands popular in Moscow, such as McDonald's or KFC. Coffee House and Shokoladnitsa are present. But there is cheap Pirate coffee and CFC - Country Fried Chicken, an Australian chain competitor to KFC.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256766120_880bedf567_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Local flavor also includes everything related to the sea.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255721461_fb1412548f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The Russian Pacific Fleet is partially parked on Korabelnaya Embankment. You can also rent a yacht there for walks, banquets and fishing.
<p/>

On the shore there is a submarine turned into a museum.
<p/>

The most popular Far Eastern dish is called "pyan-se". This is a big dumpling with spices. Sold hot from mobile carts and costs 50 rubles. Very satisfying.
<p/>

<p>
In general, Vladivostok is a distant city, but ours (as Lenin said).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256471324_26027a42a6_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Birobidzhan</h2>
<p>
Birobidzhan is the capital of the Jewish Autonomous Region, a godforsaken little region in the Far East where regions tend to be huge. There are no Jews here (1% of the population), since everyone left for Israel a long time ago, there has been no practical sense in “autonomy” for a long time, but the region was not abolished, although it was planned at some point. Probably, we could leave it as a historical curiosity.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255929376_8c8d761aab_h.jpg"/>

<p>
Anyone arriving at the station is greeted by an inscription in Yiddish.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256678074_b3e9214f79_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a menorah near the station.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256130703_1a05c242eb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
By the way, it is a cultural heritage site. It’s unexpected that this city thought about tourists and put up signs for them.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255929111_e3f15ac2a3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
For the sake of humor, the Jewish flavor is maintained here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256678344_ee4873a34d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are monuments to Jewish musicians.

<p/>

<p>
And Jewish immigrants.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255929076_130fa0bd5a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The names of government agencies are duplicated in Yiddish.
<p/>

<p>
Overall, the city makes a pleasant impression, much better than one would expect from a city of this size and distance from civilization. In general, in the Far East, even in small towns, the tension and aggression that is characteristic of the cities of central Russia is not felt. In my opinion, it is not dangerous to walk the streets here.
<p/>

The main street is named after him. The sign is similar to the Moscow one.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255200262_e939dc24a7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are old signs here, clearly preserved from Soviet times.

<p>
More modern sculptures were placed next to it, for contrast.

The main monument.

<p>
By the way, it is also a cultural heritage site.

<p>
Birobidzhan is named after two rivers. Bira is here, and Bidzhan is somewhere on the outskirts.
<p/>

<p>
Sometimes there are loudspeakers hanging on poles through which advertisements are played.

For some reason there are penguins next to it.
<p/>

<p>
In the very center of the city, where everyone hangs out, there is a small pedestrian zone, a couple of shopping centers, and behind them is the central market.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256973060_019a6584b0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There, on the pedestrian zone, there was a sex shop with a funny name.
<p/>

“Promotions” are posted on store doors.
<p/>

<p>
Well, the rest of the city is not very difficult to imagine.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256678944_4537d08ecf_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It looks something like this.

<h2>Khabarovsk</h2>
<p>
I don’t know about you, but for me Khabarovsk was associated primarily with this view, which is placed on the 5,000 ruble banknote.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256464798_47ffcb2055_h.jpg"/>
<p>
To see the Amur Bridge (built before the 1917 revolution, at that time it was an outstanding engineering feat), you need to take a bus ride to the far northern outskirts and walk another 20-30 minutes. For such an occasion, I even grabbed a current banknote.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257307525_d47b796a6d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a museum near the bridge that is open one day a week and only in the summer.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255536487_98e25ac00d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Motorcyclists raced wildly on the neighboring hills, so I immediately remembered the legendary game "Elastomania".
<p/>

<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257307610_74581e3afe_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The outskirts of Khabarovsk look something like this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256266681_ca13e1d326_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Or so.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257307450_b8533698e8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The most outstanding place in the area, of course, is this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257307675_11b20e03cc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But to be honest, Khabarovsk is a fairly clean city, unless it rains.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255536667_a356a88bed_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Khabarovsk is much friendlier to pedestrians than Vladivostok.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257013454_420ee0740f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are wide and fairly new sidewalks everywhere.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257013939_ff0c7eed12_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The problem for pedestrians is the terrain. The central street is on a hill, and to the right and left there are such slopes.
<p/>

<p>
The obverse of 5,000 rubles depicts this monument.
<p/>

<p>
And also a view of the Utyos (Cliff) cafe.
<p/>

<p>
In summer, Khabarovsk turns into a resort.
<p/>

<p>
On the other side of the Amur is the Bolshoi Ussuriysky Island, which was half given to China, and China itself.
<p/>

Lenin is wearing a cap.

<p>
Near the embankment and the local history museum there is a whole sculpture reserve. A girl with an oar and a young you-know-who were found.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257806575_696989074d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
If you go down the hill, you can see an even cooler museum of the USSR - the Lenin Stadium.
<p/>

<p>
You will laugh, but here, too, there is a monument to Lenin, and an unusual one - it seems to be talking to a Red Army soldier. I've never seen anything like this before.

And this is modernity.

Positive billboards are being hung in Khabarovsk.

A mega-pompous overpass in the central square, which no one uses because it’s easier to run across the road.
<p/>

<p>
The buses say "Khabarovsk". They have very interesting tickets, similar to advertising flyers.

In every self-respecting Khabarovsk yard, the corners of houses are hung with advertisements consisting of black numbers on a white background.
<p/>

<p>
If it weren't for the heart, it would be difficult to guess that this is an advertisement for prostitutes.
