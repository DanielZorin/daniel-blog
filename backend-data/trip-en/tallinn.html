This touristy place is made in the style of a medieval tavern: a menu with several items, wooden cutlery, soup must be drunk from a bowl, the waitresses communicate in a familiar manner and call euros “gold coins”. Moreover, for such a tourist place it is not particularly expensive.

Prices. 10 shots cost from 10 to 22 euros, half as much at the beginning of the evening. It's expensive to buy one at a time.
