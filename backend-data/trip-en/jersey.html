<h1>Jersey</h1>
<i>21-22 August 2019</i>
<p>
After Guernsey, I flew to the neighboring island of Jersey. It was possible to get there by ferry, but the plane cost only a few euros more, but saved three hours of potential torture by rocking on the waves. The territory of Jersey is only one island, but it has a larger population than Guernsey.

The main town is larger than Guernsey.

Jersey airport looks like this. This is probably the least modern looking airport I've ever been to in Europe.

The hangar bears the name of Jersey Airlines, which disappeared in 1968.

Bus. It looks like an excursion one, but it's a regular one. All day tickets cost £8.

<p>
The main town of Jersey is called St Helier. It feels bigger than the cities in Guernsey, there is even a McDonald's here.

Several central streets are pedestrian with shops.

The architecture is beautiful.

There is a fortress on top of the hill in St Helier.
<p/>

<p>
Inside, suddenly, there is an indoor playground (and the rest of the fortress is closed, because it is used by the military).

From above you can see Elizabeth's Castle - a fortress on an island near the port.

<p>
After lunch, during low tide, the water recedes and the fortress can be reached on foot.

There is one obstacle - the algae stinks terribly, even standing on the breakwater was not very pleasant.

Jersey banknote. They have their own banknotes, but Guernsey bills are accepted without problems (unlike the main territory of England, where you need to go to the bank to change them).

Unlike Guernsey, Jersey cannot be traveled in a circle by bus. All routes are radial from St Helier. I made my first foray to the eastern edge of the island in the village of Gorey.

Next, I randomly chose a destination on the northern coast of the island. It turned out to be the village of Saint John. Jersey is administratively divided into parishes, and this is, accordingly, a parish church.

I decided to walk to the coast (several kilometers). Along the way there were someone's vegetable gardens and fields where sheep were nibbling grass.
