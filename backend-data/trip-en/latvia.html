<h1>Latvia: Riga, Jurmala</h1>
<i>4-6 May 2012</i>
<h2>Riga</h2>
<p>
The main stereotype about Latvia that Goebbels TV drives into us is the stereotype about Nazis walking around the center of Riga. In reality, in Riga, about half of the population is Russian-speaking, everyone speaks Russian on the streets, and there is no negative attitude towards Russians on the part of Latvians. Maybe somewhere in the village there is... well, if you come from Moscow to a village somewhere in the Kirov region, then there will be even more aggression, even without any nationalist background.

Now in Riga there are even inscriptions in Russian.

Including pre-revolutionary ones.

But there are also modern ones.

The Latvian language is understandable in places.

There are round signs hanging everywhere with the distances to the hatches.

From the inside, the stairwells are similar to the old ones in Moscow and St. Petersburg. I lived in one of these houses.

Riga is a good city. In a good city the eye always catches something. I’m walking down the street, and towards me is a sorceress girl.

The coats of arms of probably all the cities of Latvia were painted on the wall.

The weather vane was removed from the main cathedral and placed below in the courtyard.

Someone touchingly made sure that the no parking sign was not cold in winter.

A strange granny danced on the street all day. More precisely, it’s hard to call it a dance, she was just spinning in one place.

Near McDonald's. But something is wrong here!

All inscriptions on the glass are in Portuguese! Simply fantastic.

<h2>Jurmala</h2>
<p>
It's been a while since I've been to Soviet resorts. Here, in principle, everything is the same, only with a slight Latvian specificity - Evgenijs Petrosyans and Nikolays Baskovs perform.
<p/>

<p>
All jokes aside, Jurmala is a great place. I was in the off-season, which means the beach would be empty and the city would be sleepy.
<p/>

<p>
The cafes were empty.

<p>
The Baltic Sea coast here is surprisingly similar to the coast in the city of Narva-Jõesuu in Estonia, where I was in August 2006.
<p/>

<p>
If you move away from the shore, it is also very similar to Estonia. It also reminds me of a sanatorium in some forests.

Soviet boarding houses are abandoned and dilapidated.

But instead of them, many new ones were built.

<p>
Wealthy Russians love to build dachas here. On the one hand, everyone speaks Russian as usual. On the other hand, Europe allows you to obtain residency.

Sometimes rarities drive along the streets.

The main street is very European.

The concert hall is quite small. Similar ones can be found at resorts in Crimea and the Black sea towns; in the summer there are frequent concerts of Russian pop stars.
