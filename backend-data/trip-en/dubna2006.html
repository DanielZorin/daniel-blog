<h1>Russia: Dubna</h1>
<i>July 13-19, 2006</i>
<p>
The Summer Linguistic School was held in a sanatorium near Dubna, where I went to hang out and prepare a little for the International Olympiad in Estonia. I arrived late, as I was taking the entrance exams to Moscow State University and had to walk from the Dubna station by road. I don’t remember the city of Dubna.
