<h1>Australia: Sydney, Wollongong, Palm Beach, Newcastle</h1>
<i>25-31 January 2020</i>
<h2>Sydney</h2>
<p>
Since the <a href="../sydney">first trip</a> I wanted to return to Australia and Sydney in particular, so during my second trip to Oceania I allocated more days for transit through this beautiful country. Since I had visited all the states and their capitals, traveling to a new place was not so easy: although I could already rent a car, the distances in Australia are enormous, and it takes about two weeks to travel beyond the immediate vicinity of a big city. So I decided to just spend seven days in and around Sydney, since there are more than enough interesting places there, and at the same time well-developed public transport. As a result, it turns out that Sydney is among my leaders in terms of time spent there among all the cities in the world, and in general this is absolutely deserved; I would spend another 10 days there with interest.

And now, 8 months later, I'm back in Sydney. The opera is still out there.

In the 8 months I've been away, Sydney's transport system has expanded dramatically. A whole network of new trams opened in the center, because of which many central streets were previously dug up.

A full-fledged metro has also opened, although it still runs on the northern outskirts, and will only come to the center in a few years.

In Sydney there are limits on fares - a maximum of about 16 dollars per day (on Sunday - less than 3), and about 50 per week. I traveled a lot, but only at the very end I reached the weekly limit: the time for free transfers is very long, many of my trips were counted as one, in addition, after 10 trips a week, each new trip also came with a big discount. On the last day, I decided for fun to ride the ferries at night, since in the center area they operate until late.

This ferry first reached the northern shore, in the Luna Park area near the bridge.

Sydney is convenient to view from the water, fortunately there are many regular ferry lines around the bay, and travel on them is inexpensive, comparable to travel by train (and general daily and weekly limits apply). In addition, there is one ferry line that goes far into the bay, and then along the river that flows into this bay. There are also a lot of interesting things along the way, so I rode this whole line from end to end. In the center, ferries, as always, leave from the Opera building (Circular Quay), and there are several terminals, and the farthest of them is already familiar to me from last time <a href="../sydney">Parramatta Station</a>. To get to the ferry station, I had to go through the entire city center, which I had already seen. The Parramatta River flows there, along which the ferry travels initially.
<p/>

There were also tourists on the ferry; it was quite convenient to take photographs standing at the stern.

This is a very interesting place, listed as a World Heritage Site. It was originally a prison where convicts, the first settlers in Australia, were kept.

Last time I was on the Pacific coast was Watsons Bay, but Sydney has many more interesting coastal places worth visiting. The most famous beach is called Bondi Beach, which, oddly enough, is pronounced “Bon - die”, and not "Bondy".

Here is the northern cape. Unlike the south, getting there is more difficult - transport goes to the Manly area, but from there it’s another 5 kilometers on foot, although you can get there by car. Moreover, most of this peninsula is occupied by a military base, so you can only come and go along one road, going up the middle of the peninsula. So another time.

It turned out that because of the holiday, the ferries stopped running early, and I almost got stuck on Manly - the queue for buses filled the entire sidewalk, like rush hour in the Moscow metro. I took a bus that did not go to the center, and later at the junction station I changed to one that goes to the center, thereby avoiding the crowd.

On the last day I managed to go to the Royal National Park. It is Australia's oldest national park and the second oldest in the world after Yellowstone in the USA. The park is located in the southern suburbs of Sydney and includes a piece of ocean coastline. You can enter from three sides. The closest station to the center is Loftus, from where you can walk to the western edge of the park in 5 minutes, although you will have to cross the highway. From the next couple of stops you can also walk to the park, but longer. Otford station is near the coast on the southern boundary of the park, and the Cronulla terminus is near the northern boundary, served by ferries across the river from Cronulla. From Otford to Bundeena the road goes through the entire park, but it is not easy - more than 30 kilometers, and if anything, after half the way there are no roads, you can’t even get there by taxi. I visited the northwestern part of the park.

<p>
The Sydney Tram Museum is located outside Loftus Station. There used to be a regular tram line running inside the park, but since the 1980s it was turned into a tourist line. Now the tram (Like the entire museum) operates only twice a week - on Sunday and for some reason on Wednesday.

Having crossed the highway, I immediately went onto a path through the forest. In Australia, the forest is called bush, and respectively, hiking = bushwalking.

This park appears to have been undamaged by the January 2020 wildfires, but there are remains from the fires of several years earlier. Fires in the forests of Australia occur regularly (in 2020 they were stronger than usual), and the local flora is adapted to this - although the trunks are scorched, the tree continues to live.

<h2>Newcastle</h2>
<p>
One day I traveled from Sydney to the seventh largest city in Australia (and the last of the top 10 where I had not been), the namesake of the English Newcastle-upon-Tyne. It takes two and a half hours to get there from Sydney, but the city fare applies, and outside rush hour it costs only $5.
