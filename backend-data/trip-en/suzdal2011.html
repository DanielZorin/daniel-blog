<h1>Russia: Suzdal</h1>
<i>August 11-14, 2011</i>
<p>
In the summer of 2011 I visited Suzdal for the first time. This was my first independent trip in Russia, and it changed my mind. Since then, I have continued to methodically travel to different Russian cities. Suzdal was incredibly beautiful, however, I forgot the charger for the camera, and the batteries were dead, so I only took bad photos with my phone.
