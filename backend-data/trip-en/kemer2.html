<h1>Turkey: Kemer</h1>
<i>21 May - 18 August 2022</i>
<h2>Kemer</h2>
<p>
In summer everything is fine in Kemer, except for two things. Firstly, it’s hot, you need to run the air conditioning. Secondly, there are a lot of tourists, because of this, sometimes you can’t fit into the bus, and at the Deniz bank you have to wait in line for an hour and a half (I regretted a hundred times that I didn’t choose Ziraat, where there is no such problem).

The arch above the entrance to my house bloomed in May, but by June it had fallen off.

The pomegranates began to bloom and bear fruit, but the mulberries were gone by the end of June.

A pedestrian and bicycle path was built along almost the entire river.

The road across the river dries up in summer - it's a shorter route to Kemer.

Çamyuva beach is the far part where there are no hotels, there is a camper parking area nearby.

I discovered a Georgian restaurant in Kemer, not bad. It's called "Come in, genatsvale."

I also visited a steakhouse in Çamyuva, a steak costs about 300 liras ($16).

<h2>Göynük</h2>
<p>
Göynük is the first city north of Kemer. There is both a beach and mountains.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52210023690_2ec0f29f7d_o.jpg">

<p>
The entrance to Göynük is the most epic of all the cities in the area - there is an arch, and flags, and the name of the city.

<p>
First of all, I went towards the Göynük Canyon, which is about two kilometers inland.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52208533422_632162d8cd_o.jpg">
<p>
Tourists are usually driven by car to the entrance on the other side of the river. Admission costs about $25 for tourists and about $8 for locals.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52208533342_40216ca384_o.jpg">
<p>
After entering, there are some cool wooden statues along the road.

<p>
From here, the most interesting part of the canyon is still about two kilometers along the road with a large climb, but you can get there by pickup truck (this is included in the ticket price).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52209561503_d116bb8aca_o.jpg">
<p>
At the top there are two options: board a small boat with a guide, or put on a vest and swim into the canyon. I've been here twice and tried both options. To take photographs, of course, it is more convenient to take a boat, but swimming is much more fun, and you can see more, since the boat goes only to the first large rapids, and by swimming you can get much further, to the waterfall.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52210024715_9c49deff46_o.jpg">
<p>
Here is the canyon itself, carved by water, like in the <a href="../new-mexico">western United States</a>.

<p>
In some places, streams of water flowing down from the mountains are colder than in the river itself, so when you go swimming, the water is very cold at first, but when you pass a couple of these waterfalls, it becomes warmer.

<h2>Beldibi</h2>
<p>
Beldibi is the northernmost settlement in the Kemer region on the road to Antalya. As in Kiriş, large hotels occupy most of the territory, and the residential area is relatively small.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52219700337_23f5105266_o.jpg">

<p>
There is a police station on the highway near the bus stop, where passengers' documents are sometimes checked.

<h2>Kuzdere</h2>
<p>
The villages of Kuzdere and Arslanbucak are located beyond Kemer and Çamyuva, far from the sea. There are practically no hotels here; life is tranquil and almost rural.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52208530447_10d5fff14d_o.jpg">
<p>
To get to Kuzdere, I just need to go under the main road. In the distance you can see a pair of rocks reminiscent of <a href="../rio-de-janeiro2021">Brazil</a> or <a href="../greece">Meteora</a>, which I saw from the bus window. I went closer to them.
<p/>

<h2>Çıralı</h2>
<p>
Çıralı is the southernmost point of the Kemer region. Getting here is quite difficult - there are no direct buses, you need to catch a bus on the highway that goes further to Kumluca/Finike, get off at the turn and wait there for a minibus that seems to run once an hour, but probably only in the summer, since I didn’t see it in the spring after waiting 2 hours.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52209534851_b96b12bf6b_o.jpg">

<p>
If you go to Çıralı by car, you can stop along the way in the village of Ulupinar at the top near the highway. This village is famous for its restaurants (there are advertisements on the highway); you can sit in a beautiful place in the forest near the waterfalls.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52208528317_0114c085a7_o.jpg">
<p>
There is space for cars, of course.

Next I tried to climb Mount Chimera. This is a mountain at the top of which there is a release of methane, which is why there is a fire burning there all the time.
<p/>

Here I made a mistake - I followed the short path indicated on MAPS.ME. Starts at this hotel.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52209804019_4c187f4324_o.jpg">
<p>
The path was poorly marked, I soon got lost and lost my way, scratched all my legs and arms on thorny bushes, despaired and went down.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52210020180_39976cc3ae_o.jpg">
<p>
There is no need to go here. If you have a car, drive right through Çıralı and there will be a parking closer to the top, where the climb should be much easier.

The village of Çıralı strongly contrasts with the rest of the coastal towns of the Kemer region, where there are many huge all-inclusive hotels. The atmosphere of this place is reminiscent of some backpacker resort in Southeast Asia.

<p>
Unexpectedly, Olympos has a huge number of people, although 500 meters further north there are much fewer. The fact is that you can approach Olympos by car from the other side (this will already be the territory of the neighboring Kumluca district, you need to leave the highway much later), go through the ruins and go out to the beach.

<h2>Gedelme</h2>
<p>
In addition to the cities and towns along the coast, the Kemer region includes a considerable territory far from the sea, in the mountains at significant altitudes of 500  meters. There, in addition to the cable car to Tahtali, which I already wrote about, there are small villages connected by narrow mountain roads, ultimately also leading to Antalya in the north and Kumluca in the south. There is no public transport there, but there are tourists who walk the entire Lycian Way, or you can go by car.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52221195710_0d8b7c68af_o.jpg">
<p>
At Çıralı, the Lycian Way splits into two alternative routes. One option is to immediately go up straight to Tahtali, and the second is to go along the places familiar to me through Tekirova, Phaselis and Çamyuva, go through Kuzdere, and then there is a road that goes first along the same Kemer river (separating Çamyuva and Kiriş) along the gorge and then up. Both versions of the Lycian Way converge near the village of Gedelme at an altitude of about 700 meters.
