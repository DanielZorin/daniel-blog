<h1>Portugal: Porto, Braga, Aveiro, Coimbra, Caldas da Rainha, Obidos</h1>
<i>25-29 September 2014</i>
<h2>Porto</h2>
<p>
Once upon a time, the city of Porto changed my ideas about the world. Having come here for the second time, I do not give up my opinion - to see Porto and die.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257403134_57b3a82f0d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
To be honest, I don’t even know what to write about Porto.
<p/>

<p>
Every square centimeter is beautiful here.

If you want to see Europe, come to Porto, after that there is little that will impress you in Europe.

<h2>Braga</h2>
<p>
It is clearly visible how similar Portugal and its former colony <a href="../belo-horizonte">Brazil</a> are in appearance. In Braga, I could not get rid of the feeling of deja vu, the local church and the church in the city of Congonhas are so similar.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946409800_baa4e593e1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
They even have the same name: Bom Jesus.
<p/>

<p>
Both here and there along the stairs to the top there are chapels with wooden statues illustrating the Bible.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256147653_fc0ca7121b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The interior also has a lot in common.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256924168_659097987c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This church is located quite far from the city center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256147398_3e219c88ca_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a funicular going up, with inscriptions using the spelling of a hundred years ago (now they write saida).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256695574_5b1d67461c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also a cave with stalactites nearby.
<p/>

<p>
Actually Braga.
<p/>

<p>
This is what residential areas look like in Portugal. Visually somewhat different from neighboring Spain.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256147433_95ef707717_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the city center, gates are integrated into houses, just like in the Middle Ages.

<p>
In all cities of Portugal, the streets are lined with yellow and black paving stones with all kinds of patterns.
<p/>

<p>
The economic situation in Portugal is not very good. On the walls, people are actively protesting, first of all, against the owners of the debt, which in Portuguese is called with the Russian word troika: IMF, European Commission, ECB.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256989890_f14c807ddd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Get rid of the troika, get rid of the government, get rid of the economy, everyone goes to the Maidan on September 22.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256989540_aa50c332a0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
As sad as it is, against this background the communists are becoming popular: “Get out of the euro! Down with the government of national betrayal! Let’s bring back the escudo! Long live the united democratic patriotic government!”
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256989955_1496eafbf8_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Aveiro</h2>
<p>
This town is called the Portuguese Venice because there are a couple of canals along which boats float.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945052752_67658a75cf_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But it still doesn’t reach Venice.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256599089_1b41696043_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It's still a nice town though.
<p/>

<p>
All cities in Portugal have unique street signs, just like Spanish cities. Here they are mainly made from Portuguese tiles.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256598924_719e353e2c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
More tiles.
<p/>

<p>
The old station building is interestingly decorated.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256052078_206f449c0f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On the other side, there is a public service announcement on the asphalt: “Only by feeling the problems with our skin, we begin to take them seriously.”
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256052063_0475ebfc5b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The print on the wall "Em cada esquina um amigo" ("A friend on every corner") is a quote from the revolutionary song "Grandola", the broadcast of which on the radio became the signal for the 1974 revolution.
<p/>

<h2>Coimbra</h2>
<p>
In what other Western European country can you stay on the central square for 25 euros, except Portugal?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256734206_5cb6f606c7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It is immediately clear that Coimbra is a student city, the walls are covered with emotional verses.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257072340_64d3443fb6_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256005832_6f191e0549_h.jpg"/>
<p>
"All the time you spent without sex and love was wasted. Coimbra is passion!"
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257479634_afdd8dd492_h.jpg"/>
<p>
“We women reject exploration of our bodies.”

<p>
The university itself.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255298652_19e3a57f50_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And here are the students. Students in Portugal wear cool raincoats, like in the Harry Potter films. Of course, not all year.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256229118_8fdbf742b4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Lace was hung on one of the streets.

And somewhere they hang it on balconies.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256776939_57110d6d1e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
"The euro is drowning the country. Down with the privileges of politicians. To prison those who robbed the country and drove it into debt. Let's unite the left front and throw off the troika!"
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257479769_be25156b8b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
As in other Portuguese cities, the views here are a sight to behold.
<p/>

<p>
Unexpectedly, there are sheets with obituaries, like in the Balkan countries.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255298787_59b410227c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the evening there was a concert of Portuguese fado romances on the main square; I listened to it right from the balcony, sitting on an easy chair.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256229363_44d0a24c15_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Leiria</h2>
<p>
Portuguese public transport is not very frequent on weekends. Long distance buses depart daily, but local buses stop. Due to these I could not visit the towns of Alcobaca and Batalha, so I did not stay in Leiria and went south. But I saw the castle on the hill.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257399280_9953e0f9d0_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Caldas da Rainha</h2>
<p>
Let's see what a small, not very touristy city in Portugal looks like.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257027255_464da00a3e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Caldas da Rainha ("Hot Springs of the Queen"), population 30 thousand. This, of course, is not exactly a backwater, but tourists usually pass by while exploring neighboring Obidos, Leiria or Nazaré. I stayed in this town because the hotel was cheaper and there was a local bus to Óbidos.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255984091_a2f1d6ada0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The paving stones are in place. Although the city is small, it is quite lively by European standards; shops and restaurants were open on Sunday. Apparently, the Portuguese have tightened their belts due to the crisis.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255254502_55e44c2046_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The bus station is right in the historical center, but it doesn’t really spoil the view because it’s hidden inside the building. The same is done in Porto.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257027530_eaea8d6ba7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also a train station here; the station is located on the main Lisbon-Porto line.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256184723_284ac2f776_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The station is decorated with tiles, and like other stations, there are antique Paul Garnier clocks.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256733094_18af3900ea_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Around the station there is a residential area.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257027410_b30bf526ca_h.jpg"/>
<p>
More paving stones.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255254607_3d27501082_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a hospital here, which is considered the oldest mineral water hospital in the world, founded in the 15th century.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256927663_b64f58ac51_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The church built on the side has been standing since approximately the same time.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256733474_da48004c82_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The windows are, as usual, gorgeous.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257472879_e715e8932d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also a souvenir shop (even two, next to each other opposite the hospital) with a very unexpected assortment.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256184918_9d41f665e7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is what the paving stones look like during construction. So cute that you want to pick it up and take it home.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946212138_f7c64eae36_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This small town has two unique types of street signs.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255983816_a86208f160_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255984041_894e9d4f7c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Even two and a half.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255254772_65043139c8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Another typically Portuguese vintage feature is a pay phone for calling a taxi.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256727316_874d8b495c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And finally, the craziest place in this town is the playground.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256733389_de088a37b6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
By the way, in Caldas da Rainha I heard Russian spoken several times. For some reason, there are a lot of Russian and Ukrainian emigrants in Portugal.
<p/>

<h2>Óbidos</h2>
<p>
Óbidos is a museum city, one of the most popular in Portugal. It's an hour and a half to two hours drive from Lisbon. It is easier to get from Lisbon than from other large cities, because there are direct buses, but Óbidos is a little off the main road, and buses heading towards Porto do not stop there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945129417_975b172a66_h.jpg"/>
<p>
True, there is also a railway station, it is located on the outskirts, on the back side of the castle. Not all trains stop here, so the bus is more convenient.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257328549_075cdb77f3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Obidos is wonderful.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257328749_4447faaf31_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The whole place is covered in flowers.

<p>
Around the city you can walk along the fortress wall, like in <a href="../croatia">Dubrovnik</a>. Here the passage is free.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257623430_d65057809f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There isn't even a fence.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257328664_d2373589e4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The views from the top are excellent.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256782313_60be44fc57_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a children's playground under the castle walls.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256580991_cbde44527f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On the other side is a cemetery.
<p/>

Aqueduct.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257328834_d2e800607c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Tourists are entertained with costumed performances.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257328774_4609969458_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The story about Obidos would be incomplete without the ginjinha. This is a Portuguese cherry liqueur. In Obidos there is a special tradition - here it is poured into glasses made of chocolate, and the glass must be eaten after drinking the liqueur.
<p/>
