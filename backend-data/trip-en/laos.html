<h1>Laos: Vientiane, Vang Vieng, Luang Prabang, Pakbeng</h1>
<i>5-14 January 2016</i>
<h2>Vientiane</h2>
<p>
The capital is the only place in Laos that can proudly claim the title of a big city. Almost 20% of the country's population lives here.
<p/>

<p>
Therefore, the main stronghold of Laotian civilization is located in Vientiane - the only modern shopping center in the country. There is also the only large cinema there, however, there are no world premieres: while I was in Laos, the seventh episode of Star Wars managed to go out of distribution, so I still haven’t watched it.
<p/>

<p>
I will especially praise the interior design of this shopping center: for the first time I see that from the first to the last floor you can go up escalators with a minimum of walking. Often the opposite occurs, when escalators are specially installed at different ends of the floor so that people walk more along the shops.
<p/>

<p>
As befits a capital, there are a number of offices of various corporations and banks.
<p/>

<p>
It looks like banks in a Chinese regional center built in the 90s.

Here the Chinese built something more modern, and a red flag with a hammer and sickle hangs right there. It looks wild. Communism in Laos is funny. When the communists decided to build a dictatorship of the proletariat, it turned out that there is no proletariat in Laos, because there is not a single factory, and 99% of the population lives in the village and grows rice, plus almost the entire population is concentrated along the Mekong, along which lies the border with Thailand, where you can sell the rice so as not to hand it over to the commissars. The attempt to organize dispossession and collectivization in such conditions was so obviously unsuccessful that in fact communism lasted only about five years, after which capitalism returned.
<p/>

Vientiane is also on the border.

<p>
The Thai city is not opposite, but 15 kilometers to the east.
<p/>

During the rainy season it probably floods here.

<p>
The capital even has public transport, represented by buses decommissioned from different countries. This one is from Japan.

<p>
Traveling through the central part of the city costs 2,000 kip ($0.25), a trip to the outskirts, for example, to the border or to Buddha Park - 6,000 kip ($0.75).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256755745_b8dc48fbb8_o.jpg">
<p>
This is much cheaper than local minibuses - smaller analogues of Thai ones. A ride on such a minibus costs 10,000 kip ($1.25) for locals, which is expensive by Southeast Asian standards. They pick up tourists mainly as taxis.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255914008_3c537d8479_o.jpg">
<p>
In some places in the city there are tables with “official” taxi prices, where the prices are simply outrageous at the rate of $1 per kilometer (as in Europe). You need to bargain or walk.
<p/>

Achievement - smoking is banned in the hospital! In general, smoking in Laos is not so common: cigarettes are too expensive for Laotians.
<p/>

A well-known brand in Laos is Number One condoms. They are very cheap (much cheaper than in neighboring countries): about $0.25 for a pack of three, there are three flavors: grape, strawberry and pink.

Laos has its own coffee. It usually costs 10,000 kip, often poured into a plastic bag with ice. Perhaps the best of the Southeast Asian countries.

The architecture of Vientiane is inexpressive, and for the most part it looks like this:

The main avenue of Vientiane starts from here. According to the plan, this was supposed to be a grand place, and the Arc de Triomphe became the crown of the avenue.

<h2>Vang Vieng</h2>
<p>
Vang Vieng, a small village in Laos, boomed in tourism in the early 2000s. Tourists were offered the following entertainment: drinking Beerlao beer, consuming marijuana and magic mushrooms sold on every corner, watching the series "Friends" on TV and rafting down the river in big tires, having previously consumed beer and mushrooms. Things were going well, there were more and more tourists, and the place’s reputation was becoming more and more dubious. In 2012, the government looked at what was happening and decisively demolished all the bars near the river, aiming to promote healthy tourism.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255686171_b635deb43c_o.jpg">

The place is beautiful.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255890378_84e8a2f0c9_o.jpg">
<p>
In general, all extreme entertainment is still available. In particular, tubing (rafting in a tire) is monopolized by one office with fixed and very high prices - 55k kip or $8   transportation upstream to the starting point. On Don Det, let me remind you, prices are 5 times lower.

Although there was a disco just two floors below, it did not interfere with sleep at all. Both nightclubs are very intimate - cramped small rooms with good walls. Several dozen tourists hang out there every day.

Classic - banana pancake. There is even such a concept as the “Banana pancake trail” - a route through Southeast Asia where typical backpackers travel. Khao San Road, Vang Vieng, Koh Phangan, Chiang Mai, Sihanoukville, Kuta and so on. Pancakes are sold on the street around the clock.

<h2>Luang Prabang</h2>
<p>
At six in the morning Luang Prabang is already on its feet. The main local show is about to begin - “feeding the monks”. Fact: monks are fed in the morning in any city in Laos and Myanmar, if you get up early, it’s easy to see. But for some reason, it is in Luang Prabang that all tourists gather. The monks once even wanted to refuse to participate, but the government threatened to hire actors instead.
<p/>

<p>
So what's going on here? Early in the morning a huge crowd of tourists is brought to the main street. I don’t know why so many minibuses are needed, it seems that almost all hotels are within walking distance from the center.
<p/>

<p>
Many sit along the street, while others stand on the opposite side.

The locals do business - they sell rice right there at ten times the price.
<p/>

<p>
Previously, it probably looked especially strange, when 90% of the servers were Europeans. Now almost everyone sitting is from China, Korea, Japan, that is, at least partially Buddhists, for whom it is not strange to participate in a Buddhist ceremony.

Buddhist monks are not supposed to have money, so they are fed by their flock.

What is happening is a show not because the monks are fed, but because you can look at the crowd of people taking pictures of how the monks are fed. Notice that all the people in the photo on the right are trying to keep other photographers out of the frame.

Luang Prabang is a rare example of a small European town in Asia. In the center there are no shacks, slums, garbage or broken sidewalks, almost no transport, but there are tiles on the ground.

<h2>Mekong cruise</h2>
<p>
To get from Luang Prabang to northern Thailand, you either need to travel 20 hours along a broken, winding mountain road by bus, or sail upstream on the Mekong. There are fast boats that cover the distance of 250 kilometers in 6 hours, but riding them is scary and expensive. And there are slow boats that take two whole days. These boats are quite popular among tourists: they can be thought of as a kind of river cruise for only $14 per day. The vast majority of tourists travel in the opposite direction (package tours with transportation from Chiang Mai are sold from Thailand), so in Luang Prabang there are no problems getting a seat on the boat, it is quite spacious and comfortable. This is what the boat looks like:
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257357184_e77b4036bc_o.jpg">
<p>
The fast boats are parked. I definitely wouldn’t go for 6 hours like that, even on a river without waves.

The interior of our cruise ship. As you can see, there are few passengers. In the bow were Laotians with large bags. In the tail you can buy food, the prices are normal, a little higher than usual, but the choice is not very good - coffee and noodles. It's better to stock up on food in advance.

There are often rocks on the river, which the navigator carefully avoids. Often concrete structures of unknown purpose are placed on them.
