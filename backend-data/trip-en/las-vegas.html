<h1>USA: Las Vegas, Grand Canyon</h1>
<i>2-5 June 2018</i>
<h2>Las Vegas</h2>
<p>
I was in Las Vegas <a href="../san-francisco">in 2014</a>, but it was very short. So this time I explored this city properly. For Americans, Las Vegas is a sacred cow, a place where a self-respecting American should go so that it is expensive, luxurious and everything is like other people do. Tell an American that you lived off the strip in Las Vegas for $20 a day and rode a bus - the reaction will be about the same as telling a Ukrainian that Crimea is Russia, or a Russian that Crimea is Ukraine. Old films gave Vegas the image of a sort of nest of debauchery (What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas), but in reality it has long been turned into a resort for retirees and families with children. And who in their right mind would go to Vegas for prostitutes if one “session” there costs more than plane tickets to Thailand? Weed is also legal in a bunch of other states. However, Las Vegas is not at all threatened with desolation, local businessmen are not stupid, and they understand that debauchery will not get you far, so there are a huge number of concerts, festivals and conferences here - the place is perfect, there are a lot of huge hotels concentrated in one place, they can accommodate guests of any event.

<p>
Las Vegas has the cheapest hotels in the USA; here you can rent a regular motel room for $20 (in all other places this will cost at least $50), but only on weekdays. On Saturday and Sunday nights, prices skyrocket several times, and my first day was just Saturday, so I stayed in a hostel and then moved. The hostel was located in "old" Las Vegas.
<p/>

<p>
Interesting fact: the airport and most of the attractions in Las Vegas are technically located in the city of Paradise. Not all tourists even visit nominal Las Vegas, although there is an old strip there.
<p/>

<p>
The old strip (aka downtown Las Vegas), unlike the new one, is pedestrian.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255614372_0da5a8bf97_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The street is relatively narrow and densely built up on both sides with restaurants and relatively small casinos.

<p>
The brightest intersection.

<p>
Suspiciously cheap ribs.
<p/>

<p>
Along the street there are actors dressed as movie characters.
<p/>

<p>
And Christian preachers calling for repentance, how else.

<p>
On the second day, I moved into a motel located on a street parallel to the strip. It sounds good, but the distance is quite long - first you need to cross a ten-lane highway, made to avoid traffic jams on the strip, and then go through the gigantic territory of one of the hotels. It was easier to get to the intersection.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257092479_226a3b6b2c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In this area, the roads are cosmic width everywhere.
<p/>

<p>
10 minutes and I'm on the strip. On one side is the New York Hotel.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256544038_70c5b21ed5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On the other side, Excalibur.
<p/>

<p>
The Mandalay Bay Hotel, from the window of which a terrorist shot people at a concert in October 2017.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257092634_90e6715894_h.jpg"/>
<p>
As soon as the section with large hotels ends, the traffic jam on the strip ends.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256544093_080e1ddda7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There's a sign around here somewhere that everyone takes pictures with: "Welcome to Las Vegas."
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256544138_f9cdeb242b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You can also take a photo with Elvis.
<p/>

<p>
Let's move on. There are not so many large casinos on the strip, about 15 in total. This is Venice.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257092724_4e50ebec11_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The facade reproduces well the Doge's Palace, towers, columns, and then the Rialto Bridge.

<p>
This is one of the few casinos that is interesting to see from the inside.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256346226_536f87ff99_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On the second floor there are canals along the entire length of the territory.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256544293_c004af1c82_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You can ride gondolas with gondoliers, just like in Venice.
<p/>

<p/>

<p>
All the shops have Venetian facades and the ceilings are painted to resemble the sky.
<p/>

Main square of Venice.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255614957_53338c672a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In most other casinos, the inside is not so interesting, just a shopping center, sometimes there are individual decorative elements, as in this “Planet Hollywood”.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257092929_b6d01f6282_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Between the large casinos there are smaller casinos, as well as all sorts of McDonald's and souvenir shops that smoothly merge with each other.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257386970_e5edce8f75_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Inside the casino there are mainly lots and lots of slot machines, but there are also areas for other games, including poker.
<p/>

<p>
There's a truck driving down the street advertising an escort. The call costs $200 (call and striptease only, all other services are paid on top).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256544568_b099dbc2e8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Escort catalogs here are in boxes where newspapers are usually distributed in other cities.
<p/>

<p>
After resting a bit, I went around the strip for the second time after dark.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257093209_0a4cfd33ba_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The illumination is working, people are walking along the sidewalks on both sides.

Near some hotels there are shows at night, for example here fountains (Bellagio).

And here is a volcano.
<p/>

<p>
I moved further along the strip to the south, got off the bus in front of the Luxor Hotel, and then the fairy tale ended, the carriage turned into a pumpkin.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257387375_35bb70da90_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There was deathly silence all around, there were almost no cars, and the rare late-arriving hotel guests wandered to the entrance, which was still 500 meters from the street.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256346811_9d7218ec6b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Well, I wandered away from there too, since nothing was happening.

<h2>Grand Canyon</h2>
<p>
From Las Vegas to the Grand Canyon it is about 400 kilometers, so a trip there in one day is quite long. The Grand Canyon is one of the most famous and visited national parks in the United States. The canyon is huge, and getting across it is not so easy, so you have to choose which side to approach it from. The vast majority of visitors to the canyon are from the south side, from Arizona, rather than from the north side, where the border with Utah is located.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256141361_ba71aa0ca1_h.jpg"/>

<p>
The journey begins with a very early morning departure from Las Vegas. The suburbs here don't seem so deserted.

<p>
Not far from Vegas will be the city of Boulder, followed by the Arizona border and the Hoover Dam.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256888424_10e9bd5537_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The Hoover Dam was built between 1931 and 1936, at the height of the Great Depression. It blocked the Colorado River, creating the artificial Lake Mead Reservoir, and contributed to the irrigation of lands in these parts.

There is a road right along the top of Hoover Dam, but you can't stop there.
<p/>

The border between Arizona and Nevada runs along the river, each of the towers shows its own time.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255410582_36963018f4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Until 2010, the road along the top of the dam was the only one in this direction for many kilometers, which created problems - it is a bit narrow, and after 2001, cars began to be selectively inspected. In 2010, a large bridge and a section of road around the dam were opened.

City of Seligman. The old Highway 66, which once connected Chicago and Los Angeles, runs through it. In the 60s a new highway system was built and this highway is now of local importance but is somewhat of a tourist attraction.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256888929_19092c72e2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are flashy souvenir shops along the highway.

<p>
But if you move a hundred meters to the side, it will be quiet and deserted.

<h2>Полет над Невадой</h2>
<p>
Nevada is one of the most interesting states for flying, and due to the fact that it is a desert, the chances are very high that there will be no clouds outside the window, and the ground will be visible for a long distance. This time I was lucky to look at these regions from above twice - on arrival and on departure from Las Vegas.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257386155_ed0e88b921_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Basically Nevada looks something like this.
