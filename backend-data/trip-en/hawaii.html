<h1>USA: Maui, Hawaii, Kauai, Honolulu</h1>
<i>11-19 February 2020</i>
<h2>Maui</h2>
<p>
The Hawaiian Islands are a piece of Polynesia in the USA. They are much further north than most countries in Oceania, but were settled by the same Polynesians who sailed to <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/tag/new zealand">New Zealand</a> in the south. They were discovered for Europeans by Captain James Cook at the end of the 18th century, around the same time the independent islands were united into one kingdom under the rule of King Kamehameha I. At the end of the 19th century, the islands were captured by the Americans and were for some time an unincorporated territory (as now <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/tag/guam">Guam</a>), and eventually became a full-fledged state. There are eight islands, but four are actually visited: Oahu, Hawaii, Maui and Kauai. There are two more small islands with a small population and no particularly interesting places, and two islands that are completely closed to visitors. I first flew to the island of Maui - not the largest and not the most populated.

I decided to go crazy and rented a bright red Nissan. You won’t lose your car in a parking lot among others, and it was the smallest car in size.

From the airport I got to the largest city of the island - Kahului. This is an American city built for cars; there is not even a business center or park, just an airport, a port, several malls and universities.

Kahului is like this because the actual capital of the island is located in the neighboring city of Wailuku, which is only a couple of kilometers away.

I went to the western part of the island because my hostel was located there. The USA is already the most expensive country for travel (except those where you need to spend money on armed security), and Hawaii is the most expensive state, and therefore the most expensive place on planet Earth, and Maui especially. A hostel bed costs $70, and private hotel rooms start at $200. First, I drove a little further than I needed to to visit a supermarket and see a town with large resort hotels - Kaanapali.
<p/>

Surprisingly, it turned out that there is no beach there, or rather, there is this.
<p/>

<p>
In general, Hawaii is absolutely not a beach place, much like <a href="http://goo.gl/4QioZr">Bali</a>. In all this time I have not seen a single good beach - either it is a narrow strip of wet sand, five meters from which there is a highway, or a small patch where everyone is packed like sardines into a barrel (probably there are also closed beaches of expensive hotels).
<p/>

<p>
Hawaii (as, by the way, the aforementioned Bali) is a place for surfing the waves, and a place with the coolest nature, volcanoes, canyons, etc.

From the embankment you can see the neighboring island of Lanai. You can get there by ferry, but it’s not clear what to do next, other than rent a car at the port.

Prices for services for tourists are surprisingly adequate, I would expect that if a mere hostel costs 70 dollars, then a surfing lesson should be at least a thousand, but no, only 29.

<h2>Hawaii</h2>
<p>
The largest island of the Hawaiian archipelago is also called Hawaii, or in everyday life - the Big Island. Its eastern and western coasts are very different in climate: all the resorts are on the sunny western side, and in the east there are mountains, which make the coast rainier. There is an airport on each coast. I flew into the much busier Kailua-Kona airport on the west and lived in the east near Hilo, so it was a round trip. There are two roads: a long one along the southern coast and a twice shorter one straight through the mountains. For a long time, the short road was of very poor quality, but about 5 years ago it was finally completed, and you can cross the island in about two hours if you wish. But initially, upon arrival, I had almost the whole day to spare, so I drove along the southern road, seeing the sights along the way.
<p/>

<p>
Kailua-Kona Airport is unusual in that it is partially open-air, with canopies covering the check-in and security counters, but much of the area is exposed to rain.

To begin with, I stopped in the city of Kona, and at the same time stocked up at the supermarket, because there were no supermarkets expected for the next 100 kilometers. Kona is a typical American city with very wide streets. Most of the large hotels with beaches are in this area, but not in the city center.

Further south, not far from the highway, is Puuhonoa o Honaunau ("Hideaway at Honaunau"), one of only three parks in the Hawaiian Islands that accept the national park pass, valid for all U.S. parks.

<p>
Like other Polynesian cultures, the Hawaiians had the concept of "taboo" (in Hawaiian "kapu") - prohibition. The death penalty was imposed for breaking a taboo, but there was one way to escape - to have time to get to the Honaunau shelter, where the priests absolved sins.

After Naalehu, all the way to the eastern coast there is practically nothing (in terms of settlements) - only one village, and a settlement serving the main local national park. The road is straight as an arrow, and I drove along it, without stopping, so as to have time to get to the hotel before dark and not in the rain.

The main attraction of the island of Hawaii is Volcanoes National Park in the southeast of the island. There is the Kilauea volcano, which erupted live from 1983 to 2018. In 2018, the eruption ended, and now you won’t be able to look at the hot lava, but there is still a lot of interesting to do there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256918149_d71ec74374_o.jpg">
<p>
This park can only be reached by car, and you can only move around inside on your own. I didn’t see a single bus, so most likely there are no organized excursions. The entrance is located quite high above sea level, and gradually you can go down to the coast itself. After entering, you almost immediately find yourself at the edge of the Kilauea volcano.
<p/>

Then there is essentially only one road, it leads to the coast. Along the way there are mini-craters left over from eruptions of different years - the 1970s, 1980s, etc.

Dead end. You can’t go further (more precisely, you can’t go a kilometer before this point, there’s parking there, but here you definitely can’t even walk). Until 2018, fresh lava flowed somewhere further along this road, periodically destroying it. In theory, now it should go continuously to the south-eastern corner of the island, but is used only by special services.

On the island of Hawaii, I lived in the southeast corner near the town of Pahoa. This is the cheapest place in the entire state - it only cost about $30 to rent a room.

More precisely, I did not live in the city itself, but in a residential area a few kilometers from it, built almost in the middle of a forest. This is what the streets looked like there, those where there is asphalt (my house was in a completely new part, and asphalt had not yet been delivered to the street there.

In fact, there are two caves here, you can go either right or left. Moreover, almost no one goes to the left, especially deeper, but there you can also go very far, and it’s easier - the arches are higher there and the floor is more level; I probably walked several hundred meters deep.

No one bothered me, so I placed the camera on some rock instead of a tripod and tried to shoot with a long shutter speed. It turned out well, for a place with complete darkness.

South of my base in Pahoa was the area most affected by the recent volcanic eruptions. I went there to investigate how it looks.

End of the road. There is a sign “End of the road, no passage”, but in principle you can go further, only there is a dirt road, no asphalt. Some cars were coming from there. In theory, this road should connect with the national park where I was earlier.
<p/>

A couple of kilometers after the end of the road there used to be a village called Kalapana, but it was destroyed by a volcanic eruption and all the residents were resettled.

If you turn a little before the dead end, after a couple of kilometers you will find yourself on a road that runs along the coast. There, too, there is a dead end with a lonely cafe, and further you can only go through fields of frozen lava.

I drove further along the coast. According to the map, there are only a couple of small villages there. At one point there were a lot of cars parked along the side of the road - this is because the only sandy beach in the area is located here.

There really was a passage, even two, but in both of them there was a sign at the entrance that only local residents were allowed to go, so I didn’t risk it - the USA is a country where you definitely don’t want to deal with the police, otherwise they’ll put a knee on your neck. At the end of the road is Isaac Hale Park.

On the last day, I had a flight at about 10 am, so at half past five I already left for the airport, which was about 150 kilometers away through the mountains in the center of the island. When it finally dawned, I was already on the “Saddle Road” at a high altitude. The scenery was something like this, and quite cool.

<h2>Kauai</h2>
<p>
Kauai is the smallest island I've visited. You can travel around it by car in a day. After flying in from the Big Island, I rented a car at Alamo one last time and drove south. The main reason I included Kauai on the itinerary in the first place was Waimea Canyon.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256456468_c5b96affac_o.jpg">
<p>
Canyons occupy almost the entire central and western part of the island. It is surprising that this island was the only one of the entire group with such a relief.

My car is a Chevrolet. It was simply incredibly huge, it seems to me that in Russia it is very rare to see such a long passenger car - parking in it would be very inconvenient.

On the southern coast of the island of Kauai is the Russian Fort Elizabeth. This fortress was built in 1816, in an attempt to colonize the Hawaiian Islands and annex them to the Russian Empire. At that time, Kauai was the only island that did not obey King Kamehameha I, and the local ruler was not averse to collaborating with Russia, but under pressure from other Hawaiians and Americans, the Russians were forced to leave within a year. Around the same time, news reached St. Petersburg, and the central government decided not to persist in Hawaii, so as not to worsen relations with the United States.

<h2>Honolulu</h2>
<p>
The main island of the Hawaiian archipelago, not in size but in population, is the island of Oahu, where the capital Honolulu is located. It is a large city (400k population), and quite dense by American standards. Getting around the city is easy and inexpensive (about $5 a day) by public transport, and there is not much natural beauty on Oahu compared to the previous islands, so I didn’t rent a car, and finally relaxed - you can go anywhere without thinking about parking .
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256391528_2c26996512_o.jpg">
<p>
Honolulu has two main areas - the business center and the tourist area around Waikiki Beach. 99% of tourists are in Waikiki, where all the hostels and most hotels are located. The hostel was much cheaper than on other islands and was quite good - it was clean, tidy, and there was no need to crowd around the kitchen, because each dorm had its own kitchen. I didn’t like the Waikiki area at all - it looks like some kind of gulag with white walls and black bars.

Unusual buses are not ordinary city transport, but a special network of routes for tourists, and there seem to be several competing companies, however, they only run around Waikiki, that is, there is no particular point, you can walk.

The vast majority of tourists here are from Japan (not counting Americans from the mainland). There are really a lot of them, and many of the inscriptions and brochures are in Japanese. Direct flights from outside the US are only available to this island.

Bum. There are a lot of homeless people on Waikiki (and in general there is an unreal number of them on this island; there are entire tent cities where homeless people live, they fly to Hawaii specifically because of the good climate). For some reason, here they are especially dirty and ragged, even worse than in San Francisco.

While in Honolulu, I couldn't help but go to the site of one of the battles of World War II - Pearl Harbor. On December 7, 1941, Japanese planes carried out an air raid on the American naval base in Honolulu. By destroying the American ships, the Japanese hoped to gain time to capture maximum territories in the Pacific Ocean, so that they could then be held along the perimeter, preventing the enemy from getting close to their territory. I used to think that the results were more convincing for the Japanese, but after studying this history more closely in the museum, I learned that the damage was not so catastrophic - 4 battleships and several smaller ships were sunk, and only two were sunk irrevocably. The aircraft carriers were generally in a different place and were not damaged, and they played an important role in the war, where air supremacy was most important. Just six months later, the Japanese lost the decisive battle for Midway Island west of Hawaii, the capture of which would have given them a chance to control this part of the Pacific Ocean, after that they retreated for a long time all the way until 1945.

Pearl Harbor has the most absurd security system in the world: all bags, even plastic ones, are prohibited. You need to put everything in your pockets. Carrying a camera in your hand is not prohibited. At the same time, there is no X-ray at the entrance, which means it is theoretically possible to carry a grenade in your pocket.
<p/>

Pearl Harbor is an active base, and the vast majority of it is closed to the public.
