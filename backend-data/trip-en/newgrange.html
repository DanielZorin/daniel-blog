<h1>Ireland: Newgrange, Slane, Glendalough</h1>
<i>4-7 December 2019</i>
<h2>Newgrange</h2>
<p>
An hour's drive north of Dublin lies one of the most famous sites in Ireland - the Newgrange Tomb. It is one of the most ancient sites in the world, 500 years older than the Pyramids of Giza. You can only get here with a tour, and in the summer this is quite problematic - due to the large number of visitors, places quickly run out, many excursions explore Newgrange only from the outside. In winter there is no such problem, there are few people.

<p>
Excursions start from the tourist center, where you need to cross the river over a bridge and take a shuttle bus.

<p>
As I understand it, if you come on your own, you will be assigned to some group, subject to availability.

<p>
In this region (Brú na Bóinne) there is a whole complex of tombs, of which there are three large and 37 small mounds around.

<p>
Newgrange has been completely covered by earth over the past millennia, having been discovered by accident while digging for rubble for a building 300 years ago.

<p>
The facade we see is the result of restoration in the 19th century, which many modern historians consider unauthentic.

<p>
You can't take pictures inside. There is a narrow corridor about 20 meters, at the end of it there is the actual burial chamber with three alcoves. There are also spirals and other drawings on the walls. The cone-shaped vault is lined with stones so that it has stood for 5,000 years, impressive.
<p/>

<p>
Without lanterns, the interior would be completely dark, but once a year, for several days around the winter solstice, the rays of the rising sun penetrate all the way to the chamber and brightly illuminate it. Tickets inside for these days are drawn in a lottery a year before the event.

Glendalough is a valley formed by the melting of an ancient glacier (like <a href="../nz-south">New Zealand fjords</a>). There is a monastery of the same name, founded in the 5th century.
<p/>
