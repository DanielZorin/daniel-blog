<h1>Belgium: Arlon, Brussels, Ghent, Bruges, Antwerp</h1>
<i>27-30 June 2012</i>
<h2>Brussels</h2>
<p>
Brussels, the capital of united Europe. Rosy-cheeked, satisfied Europeans with multi-colored flags on their backpacks mingle along the wide avenues. Busy European parliamentarians leisurely stroll through beautiful parks with fountains in between working for the benefit of Europe in shiny new skyscrapers. Smart Belgian merchants boldly dump chocolate and dance the foxtrot at receptions in honor of new members of the European Union...
Are you dreaming? Well, that's good. Now we can begin.
So, Brussels is a huge stinking dump right in the middle of Europe.

Unfortunately it was in Belgium that I carelessly lost my camera, so I have fewer photographs from Brussels than I would like. I was in Brussels for three and a half days, from Wednesday to Saturday, but could not find any public services working. Every day I walked along the same street to my hotel, and every day I saw rows of flower beds filled with garbage. In one of them there was a mountain of spoiled bread, and nothing had changed in it for three days. The main element of the Brussels landscape is a bag of garbage standing near the wall.

Look at how cozy this cafe is, by the way, almost in the city center, between the Grand Place and the European Parliament.

<p>
If you didn’t draw a tag, your day was wasted. If there is no life in a building, it turns into a garbage dump.

<p>
Even on decent graffiti they are not ashamed to draw whatever. Sieg Heil.

Cultural layers.

<p>
It's rare to find an uncluttered corner.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255964801_347c1082f1_b.jpg"/>
<p>
Only the center, within a radius of 500 meters from the Grand Place, is tidied up so that crowds of pensioners can take pictures with the peeing boy without experiencing culture shock.

Notice how many butts are lying on the ground.

<p>
Where the old buildings end, Brussels looks like an African metropolis, with dusty roads and broken sidewalks. Behind the fence on the right is an apartment building, social housing for migrants from Africa.
<p/>

Brussels is bilingual. Sometimes funny solutions are used to save space.

I lived in a relatively decent area, mostly Spaniards hung out there, celebrating their team's victory in the semi-finals of Euro 2012.

<p>
Outside the window there was a huge church, on which only the cross was illuminated, and in bright red.

In Brussels subway the ticket vending machines have joysticks.

<h2>Bruges</h2>
<p>
One of the reasons for my dislike towards Belgium is the artificiality of the very existence of this state. There was no Belgian nation before the 19th century when it was created as a result of political intrigues of serious powers, and before that the territory of Belgium managed to be under the rule of several different countries. The authorities of the European Union placed them in this non-state on purpose so that no one would be offended. Hence the constant political friction between Wallonia and Flanders, which, it would seem, should be impossible in such a country rich in money.
<p/>
<p>
I must say, the Dutch part of Belgium is much nicer than the French part.

The most interesting thing in Bruges is a church in some nook, where inside there is something like this.

Sometimes the hole is just through, the newspaper falls into the hallway.

I've never seen a barrel organ before. I imagined it as something you could hold in your hands, not a cart.

In Bruges, I never had time to see what the city looks like on the other side of the ring road that encircles the historical center.

<h2>Ghent</h2>
<p>
In Ghent there is devastation a la Brussels.
<p/>

<p>
Good old trash bags.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256121621_3358701856_h.jpg"/>
<p>
They are everywhere.
<p/>

<p>
Some people place them against the wall, others against the roadway.
<p/>

<p>
This trash can was once a water fountain.

<p>
The signs are not bad.
<p/>

<p>
Seek and destroy.
<p/>

<p>
Well, in general, Ghent is not so bad, it’s certainly more beautiful than Brussels. There is a purely Dutch beauty in it.

<h2>Antwerp</h2>
<p>
Antwerp is a place where diamonds are traded.
<p/>

<p>
They used to trade here.

Now here.

<p>
The main street has been dug up according to tradition.

<p>
There is also a house of the artist Rubens in Antwerp, where his paintings are exhibited. Coming out of the museum, on the bench opposite I saw a gay man, spherical in a vacuum, with full makeup. It’s a pity I didn’t have time to take a photo, otherwise it could have been used as a demotivator about decaying Europe. In general, contrary to popular belief among Orthodox activists, visual “propaganda of homosexuality” is very rare in Europe, with the exception of gay pride parades themselves. Or does it seem to me because <i>gaydar</i> doesn’t work for me?
