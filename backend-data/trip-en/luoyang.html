<h1>China: Luoyang, Yichang, Zhangjiajie, Jishou, Fenghuang, Huaihua</h1>
<i>1-10 April 2015</i>
<h2>Luoyang</h2>
<p>
The city of Luoyang is one of the ancient capitals of China, as well as a large modern city with a lot of things to do.
<p/>

<p>
On one of the squares I found a party of commies. Naturally they sit with the flags of China and the USSR.
<p/>

<p>
Nearby, political information was hung on strings, which, alas, I could not understand.
<p/>

<p>
And nearby on the lawn are posters with such seditious words as “democracy” and “freedom.” They say that if you enter “democracy” into a Chinese search engine, you won’t find anything interesting, because everything is censored.

Further on in the same square there is a disco for pensioners.

And then the star of the day - an incredibly authentic dining room. It was like being in the Soviet Union.

Another mosaic, like in the USSR, underneath it is the triumph of capitalism.

Luoyang also has its own old city with a wall.

At first glance, here is the same street of souvenir shops as everywhere else.

The souvenir shop sells fans with portraits of not even general secretaries, but simply generals. I recognized only Ling Biao.

It may seem that Luoyang is some kind of unknown city, but in fact there are a lot of tourists here, they just all go to only one place - the Longmen Grottoes. About them next time.

From a distance, the Longmen Grottoes are very reminiscent of <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/336030.html">Vardzia Monastery in Georgia</a>.
<p/>

<h2>Yichang</h2>
<p>
Any guidebook about the city of Yichang (a regional center in Hubei province) will write that there is the “Three Gorges Dam” - the largest dam in the world. To get there, you need to go out of town with two transfers, the entrance is also very expensive, so I didn’t go. Instead, I decided to find out what the city of Yichang is like, and whether there is something to do there for one day on the way from Luoyang to Zhangjiajie.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255034552_35fef1fc16_o.jpg">
<p>
The train from Luoyang arrived at Yichang East Station. Usually slow trains with seated and reserved seat cars arrive at the station in the city center, but in Yichang such a station is closed, so the station for high-speed trains is used, located on the outskirts of the city. Opposite the station, everything has been thoroughly excavated, so even Baidu maps did not have time to update: you can see several hotels on the map where everything has now been demolished. However, a little further away there is a normal residential area where you can check in for 70 yuan. The area looks something like this.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257904540_47ea2c9873_o.jpg">
<p>
From here it is easy to get to the city center by bus, the distance is 15 kilometers. The overpass is as sophisticated as always.

Very cozy park. If you don't know what to do in China, go to the park.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255966013_df006e6c47_o.jpg">
<p>
There are sculptures in the park, just like in Soviet parks.
<p/>

Here are swans, for example.

In this beautiful park, near the children's attractions, the song “Opera No. 2” by the famous Russian singer Vitas suddenly began to play. It turned out that Vitas is popular in China and constantly organizes concerts there.

Further in the center of Yichang, a church was discovered. Well, it would seem, what could be more boring than another church? But not here.
<p/>

It seems to be a Catholic church; they even hung a copy of The Last Supper.

On the other hand, the icons above the altar are not at all Catholic.
<p/>

<p>
A visit to church alone already meant that the day was not boring. You can take a walk around the surrounding area, which consists mostly of commieblocks.

There are several rusty landing stages moored on the embankment; in theory they should be used for restaurants, but apparently it was not the season.

There is also a banquet hall for gentlemen. The church is open, but there is not a soul inside, not even a guard.

On the river bank, artificial flowers are stuck into the sand and set on fire, apparently this is some kind of shamanic ritual.
<p/>

<p>
There's a ferry across the river for a couple of yuan, so why not take a little cruise?

There is a construction boom on the other side, apparently because there is now a bridge.

<p>
Suddenly it began to get dark, and it turned out that ferries no longer ran across the river. Salvation came from Baidu maps - the bus took us across the bridge to the city center. They very thoughtfully installed rain awnings at the crossings, both for pedestrians and motorcyclists.
<p/>

<h2>Zhangjiajie</h2>
<p>
Zhangjiajie is one of China's most famous national parks and has recently become particularly famous for being the inspiration for the film Avatar. You can also visit the planet Pandora, it’s not that difficult. First you need to get to Zhangjiajie city. There is an airport there, but the land connections are not so good; you can get there from Yichang and Changsha, but from Chongqing there is only a long detour with a transfer. It is 20-30 kilometers from the city to the park. The park can be entered from several directions, but the two most accessible are Wulingyuan Village and Zhangjiajie Village (same name as the city). These villages have all the necessary infrastructure: many hotels where foreigners can easily be accommodated from 80 yuan, shops, restaurants. Prices are a little higher than in regular Chinese cities, but quite reasonable.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256523829_02ec814090_o.jpg">
<p>
The entrance ticket costs 248 yuan ($50), a student ticket costs 148 (they also check your passport so that you are less than 25 years old). On a regular ticket it was written that it was valid for four days, on a student ticket - three. Such high prices are apparently intended to somewhat regulate demand - the more popular the place, the more expensive it becomes. You won't be able to cheat and use someone else's ticket, because the entrance is based on fingerprints. But the price divided into three days no longer seems so high, and it’s worth coming here for three days. In principle, you can see the park in one day, but if you go further by train, it might work out. But if you want to fly, setting aside one day is very risky, because if it rains, you will see something like this “beautiful” landscape from all the observation platforms:
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255773646_03bd165c26_o.jpg">
<p>
So I was incredibly lucky on the first day.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257064873_7766fd7f1b_o.jpg">
<p>
It rains frequently in this region and the climate here is very humid.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255044827_185f5fa4e1_o.jpg">
<p>
In the morning the probability of rain is lower, so it makes sense to set out early.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256523039_111d6cdaf1_o.jpg">
<p>
Now, actually, about what to see if the weather is good. There are several viewing platforms in Zhangjiajie from where you can look at the narrow and high cliffs sticking out of the ground. Firstly, Huangshi (yellow village), secondly, Yuanjiajie, thirdly, Tianzi Mountain (imperial mountain). The remaining places are, as they say, outside the main path, and they are mostly long walking tracks. There is a cable car leading to Huangshi, but you can only go there in a circle around the top of the mountain, and then back. Yuanjiajie and Tianzi Mountain are connected by a road along the tops of the mountains, and free buses run there. There is also a cable car to Tianzi Mountain, and an elevator to Yuanjiajie (Bailong elevator). The entrance to Zhangjiajie village is very close to Huangshi, the Wulingyuan entrance is far from everything, but there are free buses from there to both the elevator and the cable car. There is no transport through the park between Huangshi and Yuanjiajie; you need to walk along the valley along the river.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257610999_6ce010024e_o.jpg">
<p>
The problem is that going up and down the elevator and any of the cable cars costs 100 yuan ($15). So if you want to see everything in one day, you will have to spend another $60 for the ascent and descent in addition to the $50 entry fee. If you have two days, you can radically save on this by walking the entire route.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256137387_3a7071b2a8_o.jpg">
<p>
The climb to Huangshi or Yuanjiajie takes about an hour, walking along the stairs. Much easier than <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/390230.html">Taishan</a>. They say that during peak times you can stand in line for an hour for the elevator, so it’s not even that slow.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255977413_f7d5889a07_o.jpg">
<p>
You can also hire porters, but it’s not clear what the point is. It will be cheaper by elevator.

I've read a lot of horror stories about having to stand in line to take a photo, but the reality was something like this:

Getting to Fenghuang is not that easy. There is no railway, so you need to take a bus to either Jishou or Huaihua. Buses run frequently, so you can take a walk around the city during a transfer.

The province of Hunan (as well as neighboring Guizhou) is home to the majority of Chinese national minorities, who, thanks to living in the mountains remote from civilization, have not assimilated with the Chinese. The Chinese come here, among other things, to look at people in funny turbans and take selfies with them.

The excellent road to Fenghuang goes through mountains and rice terraces.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256982599_9977208a6c_o.jpg">
<h2>Fenghuang</h2>
<p>
Fenghuang is not exactly ignored in English-language guidebooks, but it doesn’t really stand out there, but for the Chinese it is clearly one of the top tourist destinations. There are even more people than in <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/298924.html">Lijiang</a>. About ten years ago, no one knew about this city, it was just a village lost in the mountains, but then one large corporation decided to turn Fenghuang into a tourist attraction. Flimsy houses on stilts were strengthened, illuminated and clubs were placed there. The city turned out to be very picturesque, so people flocked there in droves. As a result, they got to the point where the entrance fee to the city itself (!) was 150 yuan ($25), whereas usually only entrance to museums is paid.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256094081_5ef61e0474_o.jpg">
<p>
Luckily, the entrance fee is pretty easy to get around. Tickets are checked at all main entrances to the center, but there are loopholes a little further away. I used two, one on the east side, the other on the west. The first loophole: we go along the large bridge over the river.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256093846_660fe18e0e_o.jpg">
<p>
The old city will be on the left. We continue along the road until we see a large turn to the left, there is a barrier, and behind it are several hotels.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255363997_24fae50129_o.jpg">
<p>
Tickets are checked to the right, but not to the left.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256293848_66aa96020c_o.jpg">
<p>
The street goes up, but then a staircase appears sharply down on the right.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255364032_839669be7d_o.jpg">
<p>
Voila - we are in the old city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256013627_60643d1831_o.jpg">
<p>
The second way is even simpler. On the other side, along the old town there is a wide street with shops. The parallel one on the right is already in a closed area. In some alleys they check tickets, but in this one (closest to the river) - they don’t check them. I was guided by mannequins. You need to turn into this alley, walk along it (it leads to the right, then to the left), through a couple of courtyards and an arch.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257136385_e5b46930f3_o.jpg">
<p>
Fenghuang is very beautiful, but there is almost nothing real left in it. In the city center, absolutely all the streets consist of souvenir shops.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256842364_d882c41ba7_o.jpg">

<p>
By the way, although Fenghuang is a very tourist city, it is quite cheap. A hotel near the bus station cost 50 yuan, canteens and snack bars have regular prices, even on the embankment in the part where you don’t need a ticket, prices are quite reasonable.
<p/>
