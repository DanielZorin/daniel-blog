<h1>France: Strasbourg</h1>
<i>29-31 July 2016</i>
<h2>Strasbourg</h2>
<p>
Despite the German name, Strasbourg is located in France (but from 1871 to 1918 it was in Germany). It is symbolic that the institutions of the European Union were placed on the border of two long-time warring countries. The most recognizable is the European Parliament. It also has a second residence in <a href="../belgium">Brussels</a>. Parliament meets in Strasbourg once a month, with additional sessions held in Brussels, closer to the rest of the EU authorities.

The flags in front of the building are arranged according to the names of countries in alphabetical order, with the name of each country spelled in its language. So, the flags of Spain and Ireland are next to each other, because Spain = Espana, Ireland = Eire. Finland = Suomi next to Sweden = Sverige.

This is the last chance to challenge the verdict of the Russian court. Outcasts from all over Europe hang out around the court, some even live there.

The essence of the matter is not entirely clear. This woman worked as a loader in Germany; at work, she somehow injured her back so much that she could not work. A year later she was fired, and she is trying to protest this dismissal. In Germany she was rejected because the application deadline had passed.

The bridge was first called the Bridge of Arts, then the Butchers' Bridge. In 1794, after the revolution, it was renamed the Jean-Jacques Rousseau Bridge, but in 1816 the revolutionary names were rolled back, and now it is called the Bridge of Ravens.

I didn’t notice any particular influx of refugees, but what is clearly visible in France and Belgium is a sharp increase in security measures. Previously, it was impossible to find police in Europe, now here young soldiers in berets with machine guns at the ready walk the streets, and at the airport they check everyone’s passports upon arrival on a domestic flight.
