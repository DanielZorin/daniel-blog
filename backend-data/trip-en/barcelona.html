<h1>Spain: Barcelona, Montserrat, Figueres</h1>
<i>4-11 March 2011</i>
<h2>Barcelona</h2>
<p>
Somewhere here, in Barcelona, at the Poble Espanyol museum, where examples of houses from different cities are collected, the idea came to me to travel around all the regions of Spain. So I combine business with pleasure by exploring different areas of Spain and obtaining Schengen visas at the same time. At the moment I have been to the following regions: Catalonia, Valencia, Madrid, Castile-la-Mancha, Castile and Leon, Canary Islands, and also in Andalusia, but in my distant childhood.

Barcelona has a lot to offer. For example, a park with a maze of trees.

<p>
The city is remembered for the huge number of mimes on the main street.

<p>
The view from the top is not that impressive (it was taken from the Sagrada Familia tower).
<p/>

<p>
But you can see many interesting details.

<p>
The Barcelona terraces are a separate attraction.

<p>
People living in attics plant trees and place tables and chairs.

These houses are visible from the roof of La Pedrera.

However, ordinary areas are very good, there are parks, trees, benches, beauty everywhere.

<h2>Montserrat</h2>
<p>
The choir of boys in white tunics did not impress me.
<p/>

<p>
But here you can climb the mountains.

<p>
The staircase to the top is truly endless. The most worthwhile place for long walks.

<h2>Figueres</h2>
<p>
In Figueres, first of all, you should go to the house-museum of Salvador Dali.

<p>
There is also a castle in the city, but it was closed in March. All around is a typical Catalan landscape.
