<h1>Turkey: Hopa</h1>
<i>8 May 2014</i>
<h2>Hopa</h2>
<p>
Hopa is a small town on the farthest north-eastern edge of Turkey, 20 kilometers from the border with Georgia. It is interesting mainly because Batumi airport is used as Hopa airport, i.e. you can buy a ticket from Istanbul to Hopa, and then you will be brought from Batumi airport to Hopa, bypassing Georgian passport control, and it will be cheaper than taking a ticket for the same flight, but to Batumi. Otherwise, the landscape here is similar to neighboring Adjara.

It seems that in the main cities the Turks are pacifying the cult of personality of the father of the nation, but in the small ones they are running wild.
