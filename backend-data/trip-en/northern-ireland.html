<h1>United Kingdom: Londonderry, Belfast</h1>
<i>30-31 August 2019</i>
<h2>Londonderry</h2>
<p>
In 1921, Ireland was divided into a nearly independent republic (later completely separated from Britain) and Northern Ireland, which remained part of the United Kingdom. In Northern Ireland, the Protestant population predominated, and there they continued, as before, to suppress the rights of Catholics, considering them traitors who wanted to join the Irish Republic. The conflict escalated in the late 1960s and early 1970s, as the struggle for civil rights intensified, riots began and cities were divided into Protestant and Catholic areas. In response to the anarchy, the government brought the army into the region, which in 1972 shot at peaceful demonstrators (“Bloody Sunday”), and the parliament of Northern Ireland was dissolved. The period up to the conclusion of the peace agreement in 1998 is called The Troubles in English historiography. Now more than 20 years have passed, and outwardly it is difficult to find any signs of conflict, except for graffiti on the walls. Catholics and Protestants don't look different at a glance, so you just won’t know which area you’re in, although they are still quite separate.
I arrived in the city of Londonderry, or simply Derry, which was the main hot spot in Britain.

The name of this city has been the cause of intense controversy. From Derry it was renamed Londonderry at the beginning of the 17th century, but this name was mostly official, and the short one was used in colloquial speech. At some point, Derry became a point of pride for Irish nationalists; they began to cover up the full name on signs and engage in other petty vandalism. In the end, they almost succeeded, officially renaming the area Derry, although the name of the city itself remained the same. In Ireland, all signs have only the short name; in Northern Ireland, a compromise spelling with a hyphen is found.

<p>
Most of the Catholics lived in this area, in contrast to the historical center and the area across the river, which are still mostly Protestant. But at the same time, Catholics did not have a majority in the city government, because Protestants, firstly, introduced a property qualification for voting (and real estate had been given to Protestants with preferences for centuries), and secondly, they used the so-called gerrymandering - this is when electoral districts were cut so that in one constituency (where Free Derry was located) it was 90% for the nationalists, and in all the rest - 51/49 in favor of the unionists.

<p>
Londonderry has a well-preserved historical center, especially the fortress walls, which you can walk around in full circle.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256375666_320abde7c9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In some places the walls are quite narrow, like most fortress walls.
<p/>

<p>
On the other side, closer to the river, two cars could drive towards each other along the top of the wall.
<p/>

<p>
But here there is something in between.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256375641_55aac23976_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are gates on four sides, opposite each other, and at the intersection of these two straight streets is the central square.
<p/>

Walking along the walls, you can see panoramic views of the city from all sides. Here I am standing exactly above the gate and looking at the central square.

<h2>Giant's Causeway</h2>
<p>
Between Derry and Belfast lies one of Ireland's most famous landmarks, the Giant's Causeway.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256122001_708284aa2b_h.jpg"/>

<p>
First you need to get to the small town of Coleraine, and from there take the local bus. This is Coleraine train station and bus station.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257165200_02a3a97958_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Between the train and the bus there was little time to run around the city.

<p>
In fact, I walked around this city even twice. The first time my camera stopped working - due to the extreme humidity in recent days, when I left the warm train for the cold street, the lens fogged up from the inside and thawed for almost an hour, so the second time, upon returning to the city, I walked around with the camera.
<p/>

<p>
There's a tourist information center near the Giant's Causeway that costs about £10 to enter, but the park itself is free, so it's a neat scam. You just need to go straight to the entrance under the bridge.
<p/>

<p>
From there it’s another 20 minutes walk to the goal, along the coast with landscapes like this.

For some reason, when it hardens, it takes on the shape of a hexagon.

It's all about the angle - you need to photograph from the floor, and it is also advisable that no people get into the frame.

I’ll also note that usually on the photos the dry columns in the center are not visible, only the wet black ones.

<h2>Belfast</h2>
<p>
Belfast is the capital of Northern Ireland. It used to be (especially during the troubled times of the 1970s - 90s) a non-trivial place to visit, but in the last decade the city has become a popular tourist destination thanks to the popular series Game of Thrones being filmed in local studios (and on live sets throughout the region).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256115053_e4f7b5c902_h.jpg"/>

<p>
Overall it's a fairly typical British town with pedestrianized streets and a large shopping center in the middle.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256956625_c3cdc791a8_h.jpg"/>

Such a large shopping center neatly built into the old city is very typical for Britain.
