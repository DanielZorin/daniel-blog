<h1>Malaysia: Kuala Lumpur</h1>
<i>5-7 March 2020</i>
<h2>Kuala Lumpur</h2>
<p>
No trip to Asia is complete without my favorite city, since it is the main hub for transfers. This time the transit was quite short - less than two days, so I did my best so as not to miss anything.
<p/>

<p>
For two nights, I did not rent an apartment, but stayed in a hotel, and instead of the traditional area of ​​​​Petaling Street, I chose an even more central area - right next to the Bukit Bintang metro station. The Pavillion shopping center and Alor street are just steps away.
<p/>

<p>
There were durians for dinner.

<p>
It’s not the season, so I didn’t count on a buffet and didn’t go to that area.
<p/>

<p>
The next day, I got up early and went for a walk around good old Kuala Lumpur. It was something like 9-30 in the morning, it turned out that Pavillion opens at 10, but the passage through towards KLCC is open 24 hours a day.
<p/>

These letters were not in the passage before.

Park near the Petronas Towers. For so much time in Kuala Lumpur, this was the first time I found myself in this place so early (and in general, perhaps for the first time I found myself on the street before 10 am).

At this time it is empty here, like the first of January.

The calendar said March 6, 2020, Europe was already turbulent, but in Malaysia no one was particularly worried about the coronavirus - no one was wearing a mask outside the airport, and this screen was the only visual reminder during the entire time I spent in Malaysia.

Where should you go next? I took the metro and chose the end station where I had not been - Ampang, the end of the yellow line.

<p>
In general, I rarely used the yellow line, usually only to the bus station. The line is on the surface, but not on a high overpass like the pink line.
<p/>

The final station is located in the city of Ampang Jaya, this is no longer Kuala Lumpur, but the state of Selangor.

For some reason, Ampang has a high concentration of car services and workshops, with entire streets lined with them.

From the penultimate metro station I quickly and without transfers returned to the center.

Near Petaling Street, the construction of the Merdeka 118 tower continues, the exterior of the lower floors is already in place, and the shapes are becoming clear.

I entered the metro, took a strategic place at the beginning of the first car, where the cabin would be, and rode to the end along the pink line to the north - I had never been to those stations either.

From a certain point on, the train travels on the ground rather than on an overpass.

The final station is Gombak. I didn’t want to walk in the rain, but even without it you can’t really walk here - this is purely a transport hub. On one side there is a huge parking lot, on the other there is a giant shopping center under construction (very slowly). Buses also leave from here to the suburbs, including the Genting casino. It is more convenient to go to residential areas from the penultimate station.

I went to the Low Yat Plaza electronics store on business and was surprised to find that it has a front façade, whereas I always used to go through the back. The facade does not face the main street.

On the second day, I had just sat down to drink teh tarik on Petaling Street when it began to rain to death. Getting back to the hotel and then to the airport became a non-trivial task.
