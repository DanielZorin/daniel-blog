<h1>Tonga</h1>
<i>9-11 April 2019</i>
<p>
I finally reached the Pacific Islands! Tonga is one of two dozen countries located on atolls in this part of the world. Tonga is in the Western Hemisphere, but the international date line goes around it to the right, so the time zone here is “Eastern”,  13 hours from London. The main island is called Tongatapu, and 70% of the 100 thousand population live there. The capital in some places looks like a small city in Russia.
<p/>

<p>
As in Russia, in Tonga they make flower beds from old tires.
<p/>

<p>
And they decorate them with mushrooms!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254913322_c913ff76fa_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But what is characteristic of Tonga is the love of state flags. On many houses the fences are densely decorated with them. By the way, the flag of Tonga is similar to the flag of Switzerland, where they also love to use their flag in decoration.
<p/>

<p>
There are very bad roads in Tonga with huge potholes.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255642416_021dfe54a0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And here is the cemetery. This is the main feature of Tonga - here the cemeteries are in the most visible place, and there are bright posters and richly decorated graves.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256389664_aab507155b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Every small village has a cemetery, and there are many of them in the capital.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254910997_de90e5fc8e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Some cemeteries in the back streets may look more modest - there are heaps of stones and sand, and flowers on top.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256392244_2f24dbfc86_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The most important cemetery in the center of the capital - the kings of Tonga are buried here. This is a huge area, the graves are in the center, but the area is fenced around the perimeter.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255844923_d6e82a76c0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The two main churches of Tonga stand on the same square. The first one appears to be abandoned.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254911157_6f1fa043b9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Second one.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256389834_d06fd40cd0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is where the main street of Nuku'alofa, the capital of Tonga, begins. This is the local New York.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256389939_c6cb16d7fc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It even has a barber shop with columns in the Chinese Baroque style. Actually, this is a Chinese hairdresser, which we will talk about later.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256686505_99e10eb014_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A typical barbershop in Tonga looks like this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254910927_5c497b8484_h.jpg"/>
<p>
City Hall building.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256389974_779a629f2a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Another square in the center surprises with its emptiness and abundance of advertising for the Digicel operator, which operates in many countries in Oceania. I recommend it, my SIM card from Tonga worked in roaming in Fiji at the home rate, even the Internet package worked.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256688355_3783e48cf6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At the end of the street you can see the royal palace. Tonga is the only monarchy in Oceania (not counting those countries where the Queen of Great Britain is formally considered the queen). Chickens graze near the royal palace.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256686645_3ea5076169_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On the other side, you can take a closer look at the palace.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256392179_d372b5fadf_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Gate and initials of the king (George Tupou).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256688700_e1b4c8a07e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The king's portrait is on Tongan banknotes (called pa'anga, but everyone just says "dollar").
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255844698_216a63e737_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Opposite the palace stands the largest building in Tonga - the treasury.
<p/>

<p>
The embankments in Nuku'alofa have recently been improved in appearance.
<p/>

<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255847273_68ebfb0a06_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It looks like volcanic lava here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256391669_4829aac351_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But still, Tongatapu is a coral atoll, which is clearly visible from the white fragments of coral instead of sand.
<p/>

Nuku'alofa Central Market.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256391709_7c58b2376b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Prices are not high. $3 is one and a half US dollars.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255846723_9813071d10_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Many Chinese live in Tonga. They, as I understand it, run the vast majority of supermarkets and roadside stalls. I don’t know why they prefer Tonga (in neighboring Fiji it’s not so obvious). Perhaps Tonga has a liberal migration policy by regional standards. Even some Russians manage to live there for a long time.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256392309_53ac2d758f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Several years ago there were even ethnic clashes. Maybe that's why the stalls are barred?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256688975_bfd6372a46_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are also Chinese eateries in Nuku'alofa. You can eat here for 2-3 dollars! As a snack, in addition to rice, you can take cassava - this is a local analogue of potatoes.
<p/>

<p>
For three dollars they gave me four rather large pieces of chicken.

<p>
The schoolchildren here all wear the same uniform.

Tongatapu Island is small, approximately 40 by 10 kilometers. In principle, you can get around it by public transport: from Nuku'alofa there are buses to a dozen different villages, including the far edges of the island. Traffic intervals are unpredictable, from 30 minutes to 2 hours, to the second largest town of Lapaha - every 15 minutes. You can also hitchhike in Tonga, and I can definitely recommend this method - hitchhiking here is better than in the Caucasus, I got picked up even before I managed to raise my hand.

<p>
Let's go around Tonga. The lady in the minibus wears a straw skirt. This appears to be local formal wear.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256390084_627e68719d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At the cemetery at the wake, everyone is wearing skirts like these.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256686790_76efbe146f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The villages along the route alternate between churches and Chinese supermarkets.
<p/>

<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256686895_49bdd33d96_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Every small village has a church.
<p/>

<p>
People here like to go to church on Sundays.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256686740_be3bca9591_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The largest supermarket in the country is just outside Nuku'alofa.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254911507_2f291a8685_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And, of course, cemeteries. Also in every village.

<p>
I reached the farthest point in the west of the island - the village of Niutoua. Sea shore.
<p/>

Niutoua Cemetery.

<p>
Niutoua Church.
<p/>

<p>
In the villages you can see pigs grazing.

<p>
Near Niutoua is the "Tongan Stonehenge". The scale, of course, is not the same - these are only three slabs folded in the form of an arch.
<p/>

<p>
There is also another attraction called “Slanted Stone”. It is, oddly enough, an inclined stone.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256390954_5beb263e77_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I walk to the next village.
<p/>

<p>
Village of Afa. Here is the church.

<p>
Another constant element of the landscape in Tonga is the bodies of old cars overgrown with grass. Apparently it's expensive to dispose of them from a small island in the middle of the ocean.

Cemetery.
<p/>

<p>
It started to rain, and I hitchhiked to the next town, Lapaha, also known as Mua. This is like the old capital of Tonga.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256391469_2124ed0f10_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a large cemetery where the rulers of ancient times are buried.

And a large elegant church.

<p>
Tonga Airport is more like a provincial bus station. This is what the restaurant at the airport looks like. But the prices for everything are normal.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254913752_4d48d9978c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And upon arrival the orchestra greets you.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256686140_75f522efef_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Interestingly, almost all the towns and villages on Tongatapu are on the northern side of the island. The southern half is mostly fields, including around the airport.
<p/>

This is what Tonga looks like from above.
