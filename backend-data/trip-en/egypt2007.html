<h1>Egypt: Sharm el Sheikh, Cairo</h1>
<i>26 January - 6 February 2007</i>
<h2>Sharm el Sheikh</h2>
<p>
In 2007 I was in Egypt again, and this time with a camera. This was my first trip with a digital camera (purchased in the fall of 2006); before that I only had a film camera. I was based in Sharm el-Sheikh - one of the two most popular resorts in Egypt. Unlike Hurghada, which is a full-fledged city, Sharm is purely resort town. Ordinary residents of Egypt cannot just settle here, the Sinai Peninsula generally has a special status, they even check passports at the entrance (when you fly directly to Sharm, you do not need a visa at all, but for the rest of Egypt you need to buy a visa at the airport). My hotel:

This trip was memorable for the most gorgeous beach. Huge schools of large fish were constantly swimming right off the shore. On other trips to Egypt, I didn’t come across this, and even in Thailand and Malaysia you still need to look hard for such cool beaches.

Monument to the then dictator of Egypt Hosni Mubarak. Four years later he was deposed by the revolution, so it is unlikely that this monument is standing now.

I went on an excursion to Cairo. This is quite difficult, because you need to leave in the evening and travel almost all night by bus in order to be in Cairo by morning. Frankly speaking, we managed to see very little for such a big city. This is a museum where all sorts of antiquities are kept, including the mask of Tutankhamun. You are not allowed to take photos inside.

By the way, they are actually in the city, and not in the desert - there are buildings on all sides within a couple of kilometers.

Next to the big ones there are small pyramids that you can even climb onto.

I also went on an excursion to the Monastery of St. Catherine on Mount Sinai. The views inside the peninsula are beautiful and deserted.
