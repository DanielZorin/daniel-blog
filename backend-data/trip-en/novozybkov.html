<h1>Russia: Novozybkov</h1>
<i>14 January 2019</i>
<h2>Novozybkov</h2>
<p>
Cross-border train tickets in Russia are much more expensive than domestic ones. Gomel is quite close to the border, so I decided to look for an opportunity to cross it by bus, which is how I learned about the existence of the city of Novozybkov in the Bryansk region. It takes an hour and a half by bus from Gomel, and then you can take a direct train to Moscow, either one passing from Gomel, or Novozybkov-Moscow. Novozybkov is a small city (40 thousand), and not the main one in the region, but, perhaps due to the distance from the regional center and the almost complete absence of other large cities in the immediate vicinity, it feels not like a backyard, but like a center of gravity and an island of civilization in this remote area. The city turned out to be quite interesting.

Novozybkov was the center of the Old Believers community. On the main street stands their main Transfiguration Cathedral, which, before the center of the diocese was moved to Moscow in 2000, was the main temple of the Ancient Orthodox Church.

A very beautiful all-wooden church built at the beginning of the 20th century.

A little to the side by the river there is still a very old church from the 18th century, belonging to another church that is not part of the Russian Orthodox Church - Russian Orthodox Old Believer Church.

There is also a second church from the 18th century, but it is located on the outskirts of the city. I didn’t go there at night during a snowstorm in winter, limiting myself to the city center and the train station. This is the main square of the city in a snowstorm.

The lighting in Novozybkov is not very good, while in the center there are a lot of traffic lights and even lanterns here and there...

A little further the light is only from windows and cars.
