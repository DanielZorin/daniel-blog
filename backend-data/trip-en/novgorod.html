<h1>Russia: Veliky Novgorod, Staraya Russa, Staraya Ladoga</h1>
<i>21-24 August 2012</i>
<h2>Veliky Novgorod</h2>
<p>
<i>You can’t understand Russia with your mind, you can’t measure it with a common yardstick - F. Tyutchev</i>
Something completely unimaginable is happening in this city. Judge for yourself.

<p>
We walk down the street and see a pretentious panel.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257616290_de8c6ac233_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Bah, this is a factory named after the Lenin Komsomol! We are going the right way, comrades!
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257616250_d76a38a677_h.jpg"/>
<p>
We walk further down the street and see, what would you think? Church from 1360. There is nothing left at all from Moscow of those times.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255845992_3c85ff1558_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Almost opposite is a newer building - a church from 1381. To enhance the effect, the Pravda newspaper with a photograph of Comrade Stalin hangs on the church fence.
</p>

<p>
Let's move a little away from the main street. Welcome to the deep forests.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257616715_9067d1a03d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are also churches in the middle of the forests, and what churches!
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256573856_376de3c438_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Next to the church, in the middle of dense forests, there is an exemplary lilac garden.
</p>

<p>
Behind this area begin forests and fields in the most literal sense of these words. Where the Volkhov merges with the Small Volkhovtsev, and it is not possible to go further, a spring gushes from underground, water flows in a stream from the hillock and flows into the Volkhov through a wild beach, it is completely unclear how it appeared here.
</p>

<p>
And here is the source itself.

<p>
Because of the vast fields, the Kremlin can be seen in the distance. Let's go back.
</p>

<p>
Directly opposite the Kremlin is the beach.

<p>
We walk past the bus stop halfway down the street.

<p>
The map assured me that this was a monument to the victims of Stalin's repressions. In my humble opinion, it looks more like a monument to Peter I.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256775478_b9fc4a8c2a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
We make our way along impassable paths.

<p>
1406? Seen many times already.

1987? Sometimes it happens.

<p>
Veliky Novgorod does not experience problems with population decline; on the contrary, all the pillars are hung with advertisements for those wishing to rent an apartment.

<p>
Branded shops.

<p>
Kitsch.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256775108_06498a47ff_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Ordinary fascism.

Bicycle parking near the regional administration building.

<p>
A bus schedule in which they forgot the most important thing - to write the route numbers.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257321474_64205e5b34_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Each house has a sign with the name of the management company and its telephone number.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256775158_1d2202d6c7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The city is surrounded by an earthen rampart. Behind the rampart the enchanting roads of the Novgorod region begin.
</p>

<p>
Yes, like this.

<h2>Staraya Russa</h2>
<p>
A very sad place, one might say, a typical Russian outback. Once it was a resort with mineral waters, but when railways were built in the 19th century, everyone began to go to Pyatigorsk, and Staraya Russa fell into disrepair.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255752143_c7b8de5124_h.jpg"/>

<p>
Immediately after leaving the station the landscape looks something like this.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256295794_cc0c25e7b4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Rusty mailboxes, an indispensable attribute of devastation.
</p>

<p>
The main street is somewhat subtly reminiscent of Jakarta. Probably because of a white house with a light brown roof.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255547006_0c51c20207_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Another typical Jakarta landscape.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255547296_91b9a731d1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Typical wall.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254817197_88e4e8fc1c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the whole city, two buildings have been properly restored. Main church...
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256592185_b8fd818c36_h.jpg"/>
<p>
...and the house where Fyodor Dostoevsky lived. The city is famous for being the prototype for the setting of The Brothers Karamazov.
</p>

<p>
It must be said that the other houses appearing in the novel are in a deplorable condition, only memorial plaques hang and the windows are boarded up. Grushenka's house:
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255752063_24e0d91284_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Sometimes there are decent looking private houses.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255547421_ae7e57fa2a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Although judging by the advertisements for sale, there are still more people who want to leave.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255546776_84cbae3cad_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are original memorial plaques attached to stones throughout the city.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254817442_237b4a9308_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a sudden pre-revolutionary monument in memory of the Russian-Japanese War.
</p>

<p>
Beach.

<p>
Embankment.

<p>
Strange iron boxes for sale.

<p>
Public transport is bad. I couldn't find the schedule anywhere. For some reason, on every bus and every minibus it was written that the route number was 7. But somehow I can’t believe that there is only one route, even with a lucky number.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255752123_a8979968e9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Since little restoration is done in the city, there are a lot of old signs here. The house number on them is duplicated three times. House 666:
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256295754_2bbb03ea30_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Handwritten index.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254816847_8bcf6baa95_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Where the signs are new, they spent money on them. For the first time I saw letters written with paint peeling off.

<p>
Goodbye, Saint Russa.

<p>
I hope all is not lost for you too.

<h2>Staraya Ladoga</h2>
<p>
Lost among the vast northern plains is one of the oldest settlements in Russia.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256591705_7a1827fbbd_h.jpg"/>

<p>
Ladoga is at least 1259 years old.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254815947_2309258772_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Nominally this is not a city, but a village. There is only one bus.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256295054_b555f2f204_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Everything is named after ancient Russian princes.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255545751_a1016e9326_h.jpg"/>
<p>
One of them, Prophetic Oleg, is allegedly buried outside the city.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255751373_4c4438365a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
People come here from all surrounding towns to celebrate their weddings.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254815892_352aee9cce_h.jpg"/>
<p>
To attract more tourists, the fortress is being completed. You can see what it looked like before restoration inside.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255545911_27db52c600_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also a monastery in Ladoga.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255546001_aacefedcdb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It is notable primarily for the design of the garden. It's not just well-groomed.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256295129_06772d7af2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are also life-size figurines of various animals placed here and there.
</p>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255751058_ffd8f77cea_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are also a couple of interesting structures on the territory of the monastery.

The rest is pure beauty.
