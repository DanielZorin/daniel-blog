<h1>Russia: Veliky Novgorod, Staraya Russa, Staraya Ladoga</h1>
<i>21-24 August 2012</i>
<h2>Veliky Novgorod</h2>
<p>
<i>You can’t understand Russia with your mind, you can’t measure it with a common yardstick - F. Tyutchev</i>
Something completely unimaginable is happening in this city. Judge for yourself.

<p>
We walk down the street and see a pretentious panel.

<p>
Bah, this is a factory named after the Lenin Komsomol! We are going the right way, comrades!

<p>
We walk further down the street and see, what would you think? Church from 1360. There is nothing left at all from Moscow of those times.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255845992_a60104c48c_o.jpg">
<p>
Almost opposite is a newer building - a church from 1381. To enhance the effect, the Pravda newspaper with a photograph of Comrade Stalin hangs on the church fence.

Let's move a little away from the main street. Welcome to the deep forests.
</p>

<p>
There are also churches in the middle of the forests, and what churches!
</p>

<p>
Next to the church, in the middle of dense forests, there is an exemplary lilac garden.

<p>
Behind this area begin forests and fields in the most literal sense of these words. Where the Volkhov merges with the Small Volkhovtsev, and it is not possible to go further, a spring gushes from underground, water flows in a stream from the hillock and flows into the Volkhov through a wild beach, it is completely unclear how it appeared here.

Because of the vast fields, the Kremlin can be seen in the distance. Let's go back.

Directly opposite the Kremlin is the beach.

We walk past the bus stop halfway down the street.

The map assured me that this was a monument to the victims of Stalin's repressions. In my humble opinion, it looks more like a monument to Peter I.

Veliky Novgorod does not experience problems with population decline; on the contrary, all the pillars are hung with advertisements for those wishing to rent an apartment.

The city is surrounded by an earthen rampart. Behind the rampart the enchanting roads of the Novgorod region begin.

<h2>Staraya Russa</h2>
<p>
A very sad place, one might say, a typical Russian outback. Once it was a resort with mineral waters, but when railways were built in the 19th century, everyone began to go to Pyatigorsk, and Staraya Russa fell into disrepair.

Immediately after leaving the station the landscape looks something like this.

The main street is somewhat subtly reminiscent of Jakarta. Probably because of a white house with a light brown roof.

In the whole city, two buildings have been properly restored. Main church...

...and the house where Fyodor Dostoevsky lived. The city is famous for being the prototype for the setting of The Brothers Karamazov.

It must be said that the other houses appearing in the novel are in a deplorable condition, only memorial plaques hang and the windows are boarded up. Grushenka's house:

Although judging by the advertisements for sale, there are still more people who want to leave.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255546776_cf96db3cf1_o.jpg">
<p>
There are original memorial plaques attached to stones throughout the city.

Public transport is bad. I couldn't find the schedule anywhere. For some reason, on every bus and every minibus it was written that the route number was 7. But somehow I can’t believe that there is only one route, even with a lucky number.

Since little restoration is done in the city, there are a lot of old signs here. The house number on them is duplicated three times. House 666:

Where the signs are new, they spent money on them. For the first time I saw letters written with paint peeling off.

<h2>Staraya Ladoga</h2>
<p>
Lost among the vast northern plains is one of the oldest settlements in Russia.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256591705_19e57fa6e7_o.jpg">

<p>
Ladoga is at least 1259 years old.

Nominally this is not a city, but a village. There is only one bus.

To attract more tourists, the fortress is being completed. You can see what it looked like before restoration inside.
</p>

<p>
There is also a monastery in Ladoga.
</p>

<p>
It is notable primarily for the design of the garden. It's not just well-groomed.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256295129_86c87d5274_o.jpg">

There are also life-size figurines of various animals placed here and there.
