<h1>Croatia: Vukovar</h1>
<i>30 November 2013</i>
<h2>Vukovar</h2>
<p>
Imagine that in 1991, a reunified Germany renamed itself the German Reich, the swastika returned to the flag, the Hitler salute was reintroduced, and SS veterans were honored on television. This is impossible, you say? But in Europe there is a country that did almost the same thing in 1991, and it is called Croatia. The Croats took all the symbols from the Croatia of 1941-1944, and in the 1990s they were openly proud of the fact that their grandfathers fought for Hitler and killed the Serbian occupiers. Now that the intensity of emotions has subsided, this topic is rarely raised, but no one has retracted their words. Therefore, all true Russian patriots who hate the Latvian SS legions should refuse to travel to Croatia.

Let's move on to later events. In 1991, Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia. Since the laws of Yugoslavia did not allow the separation of the union republics, the Croats adopted their own constitution with blackjack and hookers (at the same time, while building their state, for some reason they did not abandon the administrative borders of Croatia within Yugoslavia, along which the border of the new state was supposed to be drawn). The constitution proclaimed Croatia the “state of Croats.” The Serbs who lived there did not like this very much, so they decided that since the Croats could secede from Serbia, then the Serbs could secede from Croatia too, creating their own state “Serbian Krajina”.

<p>
The problem was that the main territory of Krajina was located far from Serbia, along the border with Bosnia, so even if Serbia wanted to, it was difficult to communicate with it. If it were possible to unite the Serbian territories of Bosnia and Croatia, it would create a more or less integral country neighboring Serbia, but this idea was abandoned under pressure from the international community, retaining the administrative borders of Yugoslavia in full. However, the territory of Slavonia, directly bordering Serbia, became the arena of military operations.

Croatia is shaped like scissors, but most tourists visit the southern, coastal part. The northern part is practically Terra Incognita for tourists. In 1991, a lot was happening in Slavonia. At that time, there were approximately equal numbers of Croats and Serbs there (now there are almost no Serbs in Croatia, since most of them were expelled during Operation Storm in 1995), and there was a continuous stream of ultranationalist incitement on both sides. The Croats were presented in propaganda as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vukovar_children_massacre">new Ustashes who eat Serbian babies for breakfast</a>, the Serbs - as the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7oHHIfh-WM">new Chetniks who drink the blood of Croatian babies</a>. In the summer and autumn of 1991, a significant part of the Serbian population was forcibly expelled from Vukovar.

When Serbian troops (then still the Yugoslav People's Army) entered the territory of eastern Slavonia, Vukovar turned out to be the only stronghold of the Croats, while all other cities were occupied by the Serbs. The city was defended by a garrison of 1,800 Croats, and the siege was waged by up to 36,000 Serbs, who also had tanks and aircraft. At first, the Serbs did not have enough infantry (and to storm a city and conduct street battles, a lot of infantry is needed), since few in Serbia were eager to serve under conscription and die for the Motherland, and general mobilization was not carried out. Due to the tenacity of the defenders and the incompetence of the attackers, the siege lasted almost three months. In Vukovar, like in Stalingrad, every house was destroyed.

<p>
Interestingly, each side blamed the opponents for everything. The Serbs directly stated that the Croats themselves blew up the houses, not wanting to leave. In the film <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weight_of_Chains">The Weight of Chains</a> you can see fragments of Serbian and Croatian news about the destruction of Vukovar, which coincide word for word up if you replace "Serbs" with "Croats" or vice versa.

<p>
After the city was captured, the wounded and prisoners of war who remained in the hospital were taken to the Ovcara farm and shot. Serbian leaders were accused of this at the Hague Tribunal, including President Milosevic and Vojislav Seselj (the politician who promised to gouge out Croatian eyes with a rusty spoon).

The capture of Vukovar was the last significant Serbian success of the war. There were no serious battles in the following years, until the liquidation of the Serbian Krajina in 1995. Vukovar remained under the control of peacekeeping forces and was finally returned to Croatia in 1998. Most of the population (especially the Serbs) did not return to the city; their houses, however, cannot be expropriated, which is why in Vukovar and in most surrounding villages there are many empty, dilapidated houses with traces of bullets and shrapnel.

Now Vukovar in Croatia is a city of military glory and a mecca for local patriots.

The government wants the population to recover, but the people are not eager to come here.

But they still have ruins.

Those who actually live here are based closer to the suburbs.

It must be said that in Croatia it is not fashionable to work even on Saturdays. 90% of stores are closed. Moreover, for the first time I saw that even the church was closed on Saturday! This Catholic cathedral is interesting because after the capture of the city, the Serbs seem to have left a lot of inscriptions on the walls there such as “God will forgive you, but the Serbs will never.” Since everything was locked, it was not possible to check this.

There are inscriptions on the stairs leading to the church, but from the other side of the barricades.

The most famous place in Vukovar is the water tower.

It was left in this form as a memorial to the siege of the city.

Interestingly, one of the main warmongers Franjo Tudjman (President of Croatia) died on time in 1999 and, unlike Milosevic, did not end up under the Hague Tribunal (like his Bosnian colleague Alija Izetbegovic). He is still considered a hero, and monuments are erected to him.

Croatia recently joined the European Union. According to European legislation, Serbs living in Vukovar must have rights as a national minority; accordingly, signs in the city must be duplicated in the Serbian language.

This causes attacks of hatred among local patriots, who consider the Cyrillic alphabet to be an insult to the feelings of veterans.

In Croatia, it is customary to hang obituaries on poles and trees.

In general, Vukovar makes a depressing impression.
