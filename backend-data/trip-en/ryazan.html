I was already in Ryazan in 2001. From that visit I remember the <i>hostel of the hotel type</i> "Teacher", which is now a hotel, and dining room number 5, where they served the most inedible food I have ever tasted. There were no pedestrian zones then.

The fate of the Lenin monument on the main square is interesting. In October 1993, at the peak of Yeltsin’s “revolution,” it was demolished, but in the late 1990s it was restored to its original location.
