<h1>Russia: Totma, Veliky Ustyug, Kotlas, Solvychegodsk, Koryazhma, Mikun, Syktyvkar</h1>
<i>17-21 September 2020</i>
<h2>Totma</h2>
<p>
A cluster of three historical cities at the junction of the Vologda and Arkhangelsk regions was the last region where I could visit several cities at once. The logistics were a little tricky: I had to find a cheap plane ticket from Syktyvkar, match the polar railway train schedule, and also figure out how to get around the Vologda region. Here, for the first time, I booked a ticket for a bus (or rather a minibus) across Russia via the Internet, it turned out to be good, they even called me the day before and clarified which stop to pick me up from. Having arrived by train to the already familiar <a href="../vologda">Vologda</a> I spent the night in a familiar hotel, and went east to the city of Totma, where the drive took about three hours. The roads got worse as we approached Totma, and the bus began to shake. Passengers in Totma were dropped off directly opposite the main cathedral.

<p>
The naked eye can see that the churches here are different from churches in other cities of Russia. This is a peculiar high elongated shape, and relief decorations on the facade, called cartouches.
<p/>

<p>
These churches are also unexpectedly narrow.

<p>
The second church in the center is similar, with only one dome.

Another unusual feature of Totma is wooden sidewalks.
<p/>

Similar ones are found in more northern cities, such as Arkhangelsk.

Wooden sidewalks are usually much better than "motor roads".

Scarecrow-traffic cop, usually they put them up so that people don’t drive cars too fast.

<p>
But I can hardly imagine how one can drive fast on such a road.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256696385_65d45d86c4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Only the most important roads are of more or less normal quality.
<p/>

I walked to the Sumorin Monastery, which is about one and a half to two kilometers from the city center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256696905_2119fe6c3d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The monastery was once great, but later became abandoned, and part of the territory was given over to a sports school.
<p/>

<p>
But the rest of the residential buildings are abandoned. On the other hand, there are other ones that are in operation; I don’t know if they were built from scratch or reconstructed.

<p>
Ivan Kuskov, a navigator and founder of the Fort Ross fortress, a Russian colony in California, is buried here. In the second half of the 18th century, merchants from Totma organized more than 20 expeditions to America, thanks to which Totma, located in the depths of the mainland, was nicknamed the city of sailors.

<h2>Veliky Ustyug</h2>
<p>
Veliky Ustyug is located in the very east of the Vologda region. This is one of the top cities in terms of the number of preserved monuments, comparable to <a href="../torzhok">Torzhok</a>. The nearest railway station is 100 km to the north in Kotlas, and I arrived by road from Totma.
<p/>

<p>
The bus dropped us off on the distant outskirts - the views there were not very good.

Instead of a cathedral square, there is a “Cathedral Courtyard” - the three main churches stand close to each other, forming a courtyard.

<h2>Kotlas</h2>
<p>
The nearest railway station with regular passenger traffic to Veliky Ustyug is in Kotlas, the third largest city in the Arkhangelsk region after <a href="../arhangelsk">Arkhangelsk</a> and <a href="../arhangelsk">Severodvinsk</a>. The bus dropped me off right at the foot of the Lenin monument on the square in front of the station.

Opposite the railway station there is an unused river station, behind which is the Northern Dvina River. Kotlas stands next to the confluence of the Northern Dvina and Vychegda.

<h2>Solvychegodsk</h2>
<p>
Solvychegodsk is located very close to Kotlas, but on the other side of the Vychegda River, so getting there requires adventure. First, 20 kilometers along a normal road, then 10 kilometers through the forest on a bad dirt road, and then by ferry across the river. Or 40 kilometers along a normal road to the city of Koryazhma, where there is a pontoon bridge, and then 20 kilometers along a broken dirt road. As I understand it, only the second option is available in winter, and in summer I tested both. Buses run both to the ferry and across the pontoon bridge, but not very often - about 3 times a day.
<p/>

<p>
The Annunciation Cathedral is the main reason why the city is among the best historical cities. This is a cathedral from the late 16th - early 17th centuries with frescoes, so even in the USSR they realized its value, and did not set up a warehouse or factory here.

Solvychegodsk is one of the smallest cities in Russia, there are only about 2000 people (but still, from the cities where I was, <a href="../vladimir">Plyos</a> is a little smaller). The city center can be walked from end to end in about 15 minutes.

The main street is also a square, in the corner of which there is a bust of Lenin. Reconstruction was underway, tiles were laid, columns with letters were installed - at that time there was only YAMYSOL, probably it was planned I WE SOLVYCHEGODSK.

<h2>Koryazhma</h2>
<p>
From Solvychegodsk the next bus was through the pontoon crossing to the city of Koryazhma - a small town with a population of 35k. There was very little time left before the train departed, so I didn’t have time to fully see this city, although initially I didn’t even plan to get here, so it’s better than nothing. The central square of Koryazhma is unusual in that it is a thoroughfare - cars from adjacent streets cross it diagonally.

From Koryazhma I went to the village of Vychegodsky. This village is located approximately opposite Solvychegodsk across the river, but still 5 kilometers from the shore. There is a railway station here, officially named Solvychegodsk.

<h2>Mikun</h2>
<p>
In the city of Mikun there is the intersection of the Moscow-Vorkuta highway and its branch to Syktyvkar. I got here from Solvychegodsk on the Vorkuta train, because the direct Syktyvkar train was at an inconvenient time. I didn’t want to drive another two hours in the evening to Syktyvkar, so I stayed overnight at the station hotel. The hostess was very surprised that I was not on a business trip. In the hotel there was a painting covering the entire wall, which, however, is not very similar to what is outside the window.

<h2>Syktyvkar</h2>
<p>
Syktyvkar is the capital of the Komi Republic, a new region for me. The city is not very big, about 250k inhabitants. The center is located along a long street from the station to the square, although there is still an airport somewhere on the side...

Once Syktyvkar was called Ust-Sysolsk, and on the high bank there was a large church. Now this place is a park with views of the other side.

Stefanovskaya Square. About 15 years ago, one LiveJournal user called for burning “infidel cops” in this square, for which he received a year’s probation. It would hardly surprise anyone nowadays, but back then it was pretty much the first case of prosecution for writing something on the Internet. It is curious that a couple of years ago the ECHR (European Court of Human rights) awarded the guy a compensation, because the right to freedom of speech was violated. I wonder if there is any country in the world where in 2020 that doesn't count as hate speech?

The very first (and only in Syktyvkar) Dodo Pizza. Initially, it only worked for delivery, so the premises were rented in a less accessible place - away from the main street and in the courtyard.
