<h1>Taiwan: Taipei, Hsinchu, Taoyuan, Jiufen, Keelung</h1>
<i>29 February - 5 March 2020</i>
<h2>Taipei</h2>
<p>
In 2015, I was <a href="http://goo.gl/U8Ykby">in Taiwan</a>, and was completely delighted with this country. There was only one drawback - you needed a visa, and getting it was quite tedious. But a few years later, everything turned out for the best - Taiwan became visa-free for Russians, and my desire to visit Taiwan again became a reality.

At passport control, the employees carefully made sure that the address of my airbnb was written on the migration card; usually no one looks at this. Much later, I realized that it was Taiwan's epidemic prevention system at work - if there was someone infected with the virus on my flight, they would know where to look for me.

<p>
On February 29, 2020, almost all flights on the board were canceled because most flights to Taiwan were from Hong Kong, China and South Korea, and these countries were closed due to coronavirus.

Let's refresh our memories of this city. In principle, the center of Taipei is not very big, you can even get around on foot, just the Taipei 101 tower is a little further away.
<p/>

In 2015, when I was planning to ride the Taipei cable car, <a href="../taiwan">it was a bad day</a> with heavy rain and fog, so I spent the entire day in the zoo with pandas instead.

<p>
The cable car is called Maokong Gondola. There are two types of cabins - regular and excursion, which differ from regular ones only in the transparent floor. There are 2 or 3 times fewer excursion tickets than regular ones, which means the waiting time in line is longer. When I was there, you didn’t have to wait at all for the regular one, and the excursion line was about 10 minutes long. I think if the line is an hour long, then you can safely go to the regular one.

<h2>Hsinchu</h2>
<p>
I decided to travel around the major cities of Taiwan, since many of them are located around Taipei. The first was the city of Hsinchu. It would be written "Xinzhu" according to standard transliteration rules, but Taiwanese cities in English are spelled in a traditional way. This city is mainly known for the production of microelectronics, an important export item of Taiwan.

<h2>Taoyuan</h2>
<p>
After Hsinchu, I went to Taoyuan. Technically, I have already been to this city, since Taipei Airport is located there, but this does not count. Taoyuan Central Station is about halfway between Taipei and Hsinchu.

In the mountains near Taoyuan (within the municipality boundaries), there is the tomb of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, as well as a park of his statues. Wikipedia says that in Taiwan 20 years ago there were 43,000 monuments to Chiang Kai-shek, but I don’t really believe this figure when there were only 10-15 thousand monuments to Lenin in the entire USSR. Recently they have been slowly demolished, and a couple of dozen statues have been moved to that park. I decided to try to find a monument in the city, but I could not do it. But I very easily found a couple of monuments to Sun Yat-sen, the leader of the Chinese revolution of 1911.
<p/>

<h2>Jiufen</h2>
<p>
Jiufen is one of the most beautiful and picturesque cities in Taiwan. It is located in the mountains northeast of Taipei, about an hour and a half away.
