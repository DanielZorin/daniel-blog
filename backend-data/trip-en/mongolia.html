<h1>Mongolia: Ulaanbaatar, Darkhan, Sukhbaatar</h1>
<i>8-12 January 2015</i>
<h2>Ulaanbaatar</h2>
<p>
Let's start our Mongolian lesson. Saturday = byamba. Sunday = nyam.
<p/>

<p>
Cold beer = huiten pivo (in Russian it sounds obscene).
<p/>

<p>
Xerox = canon. Canon appeared here earlier.
<p/>

<p>
Bra = levchik. Briefs = trusik.
<p/>

<p>
Pies = piroshki.
<p/>

<p>
Oligarch = oligarch.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255671561_86ec3e8813_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Computer pawnshop = computer lombard (from Russian).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254942662_03cf77f2c9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Russia = ohuls (attention to the leftmost portrait).

<p>
In the evening we went to the cinema to see the third part of The Hobbit. As is usually the case in countries with small populations, the film was shown without dubbing with Mongolian subtitles. So my vocabulary was replenished with the word “armor” = “huyag” (sounds similar to "penis" in Russian). Opposite the cinema is an abandoned building with Lenin.
<p/>

<p>
The hotel has a Chinese toilet brand Huida.
<p/>

<p>
Money - tugriks (more precisely, tögrögs). Becoming a millionaire is relatively easy - you only need to exchange a little more than $500.
<p/>

<p>
Zorig is the Mongolian Yeltsin. He was the leader of the revolution at 28 years old, what have you achieved at that age?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255875538_7230833c6a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Khuitsaa is a national Mongolian dish (the name also sounds obscene in Russian).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256049046_09c588dad2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I couldn't help but try. It looks like this. Very tasty and filling. Costs three dollars.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255320242_f3b199305a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In general, Mongolian cuisine is not for everyone, just like <a href="../chechnya">Chechen</a>. All dishes here contain a lot of fatty lamb, so vegetarians and lovers of light snacks will have a hard time here. On the left in the photo is the most popular dish, called tsuiwan. In the background on the left is Mongolian tea. It tastes even worse than Kyrgyz jamat, that is, it is absolutely impossible to drink. It is better to take tea or coffee in bags.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254942302_5ea198bd7b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And these are buuz (dumplings), about the same as in neighboring Buryatia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255772583_f890469bba_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In no other city in the world have I seen so many hotels as in Ulaanbaatar. Near the station there is a hotel ("buudal") in every house. Mostly the rooms there are rented out by the hour, and the condition is appropriate.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256420654_caab99ee54_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On the first day, at six in the morning, we didn’t have the strength to choose for a long time; some of the hotels were completely booked, so we stopped in a very wretched establishment with a creaky bed and armchairs from a century ago for 35,000 tugriks (less than $20). The next day, moving a little further from the station, for exactly the same amount we found a decent place with fresh renovations and Internet access.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256420554_a295129466_h.jpg"/>
<p>
As the classics would say, in the county town of U.B. there were so many hotels for an hour and pawn shops that it seemed as if all its inhabitants were born only to immediately pawn their belongings and finally hire a prostitute.
<p/>

<p>
Ulaanbaatar is a strange city. On the one hand it is Soviet, on the other there is a persistent feeling that something is wrong here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255672241_02dfa258ae_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Everything seems to be in order here: a panel house, a parking yard.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256421979_b26cf68fe0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And what is it?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254943257_c1ba5209ef_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And here is the decor on the wall in the form of the wheel of Samsara.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255670826_db64ca922e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It seems that everyone here speaks Russian, but this is not so; you almost always have to speak with gestures.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254941942_5e4b926c91_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Young Lenin? No, this is some kind of Mongolian figure, although he looks similar.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255671646_8d5e8854b4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Well, at least I wasn’t mistaken with this guy, this is really <a href="../hopa">Ataturk</a>, erected in honor of Mongolian-Turkish friendship.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255875703_7a02122887_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In Ulaanbaatar there are Chinese trash cans in some places (as in <a href="../kyrgyzstan">Kyrgyzstan</a>, and <a href="../tajikistan">Tajikistan</a>)
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255874988_9e3ba6ada3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Sometimes they don’t even try to pave the sidewalks, even on big streets.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254941857_4da728387e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Recently, thanks to Chinese investments, the city has been actively developed. Just 10 years ago there were only panel buildings and yurts, but now it’s like this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256421759_5154846664_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The central streets look like a typical Chinese metropolis like <a href="../guangdong">Shenzhen</a>.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256421864_04e954903f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Ulaanbaatar has also adopted another feature of Chinese cities - constant smog.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255876223_ab7ef536fe_h.jpg"/>
<p>
As a modern city, Ulaanbaatar does not lag behind in installing modern art on the streets.
<p/>

<p/>

Monument to the victims of communism.

<p>
Graffiti.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256717075_0f89c5706b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The traffic controllers have pedestals, like in <a href="../yunnan">China</a>.

At night, their wands look like the swords of the Dark Jedi.
<p/>

<p>
But in many ways, life in Ulaanbaatar remains the same.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255875203_ffeb775dbb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Most of the city consists of neighborhoods like these, similar to Central Asian mahallas.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254942807_c76701a069_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In winter it’s really cold here, and the ice is not removed as a matter of principle, so it’s easier to get around on skates.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255875928_ccb5b26ddc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Each house is necessarily surrounded by a solid fence.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256421594_114102d2aa_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Behind the fences there are sometimes just yurts instead of houses.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255671901_6906e3a7e4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Convenient: you came to the city (and in Mongolia half the population lives in the capital), you have no apartment. Instead of taking out a mortgage, you set up a yurt and enjoy.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255671931_a4f5f70fd0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are whole fields of such yurts on the outskirts.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254943032_8e63e75f0f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
As in the USSR, Buddhism was banned in Mongolia for a long time, and monasteries were closed.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256421639_129d248226_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But Mongolian traditions have not gone away. The blue ribbons that are tied to poles here for good luck have survived communism.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256126037_b89b4325fb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Just like mountains of stones, on which the same blue ribbons and candies are placed.

<h2>Darkhan</h2>
<p>
Mongolia boasts the world's lowest population density. Half the country lives in the capital. In vast territories, only occasionally there are towns with a population of a couple of tens of thousands, the rest is steppe with rare nomads. Instead of roads, there are directions everywhere, except for the highway from the Russian border to the Chinese border. Naturally, it is impossible to see places very remote from civilization, such as Lake Uvs-Nuur, the Mongolian Altai or the Gobi Desert, without a well-equipped jeep. I had to limit myself to getting to know the cities.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256049276_7a8ac4f5ce_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Mongolia has one railway line running from Russia to China, with small branches. There is also a second dead-end line from Russia in the east, but there is no passenger service there. Trains in Mongolia are very old and slow; in Russia such trains have almost been phased out. But tickets are cheap. A night in a sleeper from the border to Ulaanbaatar (9 hours and 300 km) costs only $9. Linen and tea are included in the ticket price. In Mongolia, all trains have "general" carriages (with unreserved seats), which are almost never seen in Russia anymore. They are very popular, since trains are still more convenient than the rusty minibuses.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256049101_5cd3d80f4f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Recently, the ticketing system has been computerized, so you can take a ticket from an intermediate station at a train station in any city. The first fast train has also appeared, which so far only runs on the route Ulaanbaatar - Darkhan with a stop in Zuunkharaa. They promise to soon launch the same trains in a southern direction to the city of Sainshand.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256249403_457b577f60_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Inside it's like Europe. A reserved seat is much more expensive - $11.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257779605_06910d4716_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Let's look at Mongolia from the window.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255319662_942cde9c1d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Steppe and steppe all around.
<p/>

<p>
Who taught the Mongols to bury tires in the ground?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256797294_c47d7d8cd4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Darkhan is the third largest city in Mongolia with a population of as many as 75 thousand. Founded about 50 years ago along with a metallurgical plant.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255319762_cc6b73faf8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Naturally, the architecture here is not very outstanding.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255319792_391f842ec3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The gray brick houses are decorated with inscriptions in the traditional Mongolian vertical script, which predates the Cyrillic alphabet.
<p/>

<p>
Cows walk along the streets.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257093215_5581f33d43_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Like India, not Mongolia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255319897_0d789efbdd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The part I go through is intensively cleared of ice.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256249693_3ede91ab72_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And no one cares about pedestrians.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255319857_1fb29b501e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
As in Ulaanbaatar, there are a huge number of pawnshops that compete with each other. Fewer hotels.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256797549_536cb738b7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The balconies of panel houses look like yurts.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256249748_29ef1da9e9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The city has two large clusters of houses, between which there are two hills, one of which has Buddha, and the other an observation deck.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256249828_840ba6828a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a grand bridge between the hills.
<p/>

<p/>

<p>
It's interesting how abruptly the city ends.
<p/>

The children rode on ice skates on the second mountain.

And someone was smoking thoughtfully near a mountain of blue ribbons.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255320212_9fddd9abe1_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Sukhbaatar</h2>
<p>
Sukhbaatar is the largest city near the Russian border. If you travel to Mongolia by train, the border controls are here. The city is named after the founder of communist Mongolia, who some years ago lay in a mausoleum on the main square of Ulaanbaatar.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256612710_a59eb9fa7e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Now Mongolia has another hero - Genghis Khan. Even the station cafe in Sukhbaatar is named after him.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256612320_11a772c770_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The rest is modest here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256612630_79b4f78de3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Photos of shock workers still hang on the honor board.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254837542_f2e2da8d57_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The station welcomes travelers.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256612385_8962870960_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It is easier to cross the border by car 30 kilometers to the east than to spend five hours at border control by train.

Shop Shop. I must say that I didn’t find any decent shops in Sukhbaatar, just general stores.
<p/>

<p>
Despite the fact that Sukhbaatar is still a village, it has quite a few hotels of decent quality, and there is Internet. Mongolia is already in the 21st century.
