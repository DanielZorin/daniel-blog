<h1>Indonesia: Jakarta</h1>
<i>18-25 November 2011</i>
<h2>Jakarta</h2>
<p>
Jakarta is not a tourist city. All tourists in Indonesia go to the island of Bali or, in extreme cases, to Central Java. People come to Jakarta only on business, so after spending eight days here, I can consider myself an expert. Therefore, there is no special tourist infrastructure here; not a single souvenir shop was found in the entire city, and everything is aimed primarily at local residents. At the same time, the population of the city and its surroundings is about 20 million people, so it’s a lot of fun here.
If you want to see terrible traffic, this is the place to go. All visitors and Indonesians themselves note this first of all. There is only one rule: there are no rules. There are traffic lights only on the largest streets; drivers are absolutely indifferent to pedestrian crossings. You can drive in oncoming traffic, reverse, cross, walk alongside cars - this is normal. At an intersection a crowd of motorcycles is pushing right towards you - everything is as it should be.

<p>
The most popular sign is no parking.
</p>

<p>
However, many people don’t care about the bans.
</p>

<p>
Here on the right there was a sign (yes, a sign!) prohibiting turning right across the bridge, but if the kid in the orange T-shirt allows it, then you can still turn.
</p>

<p>
There are many types of transport here. The most popular among the local population is the motorcycle, as it is the most maneuverable and at the same time the fastest. Motorcycles make up up to half of the vehicles on the streets. They are also used as taxis.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256952574_af5bb4c565_o.jpg">
<p>
There are practically no pedestrians here. All the sidewalks are either broken, non-existent, filled with food stalls, or mistaken by someone for a parking space. Typical sidewalk.
</p>

<p>
Three-wheeled vehicles called bajajs are also used as taxis.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256204836_04466b3025_o.jpg">
<p>
Tourists, however, find it more convenient to use a regular taxi. Firstly, Bajajs are not allowed to travel long distances between different areas of the city. Secondly, in Bajaj you have to bargain, and it is difficult for a non-local to lower the price below 1 dollar for a short distance and 2 dollars for a longer distance (the price for locals is much lower). A metered taxi will cost about the same.
</p>

<p>
Buses also travel around the city. There are buses that travel on dedicated lines and wait only at intersections. At the same time, there are transfer stations where you can change from one line to another. A route map is widely available, and travel costs about $0.30.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255475922_1557e6e8d3_o.jpg">
<p>
There are also ordinary buses, the route of which is as difficult to understand as in Moscow. Their doors usually do not close, and people often get off while the bus is slowing down in a traffic jam or at a turn. The doors don't close because there is no air conditioning inside.
</p>

<p>
Bicycles are also found. In the main square you can rent a bicycle along with a hat.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255475497_c06b290514_o.jpg">
<p>
Bicycles come in a variety of models. There are, for example, triple rooms.
</p>

<p>
There are also strange scooters that can be propelled by doing squats.
</p>

<p>
And of course, you can just walk along the roadway with a cart and feel like a full participant in the road traffic.
</p>

<p>
The Indonesian rupiah is one of the cheapest currencies in the world, cheaper even than the Belarusian ruble. There are about 9,000 rupees in one US dollar. You immediately feel like a millionaire.
</p>

<p>
Hydrants are fenced off with bollards so that those who like to drive do not create unplanned fountains on the streets. It seems that it is not in vain.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256206181_1cff42d989_o.jpg">
<p>
The memorial plaques look strange, to put it mildly. On the one hand, it’s vintage, on the other hand, you won’t immediately understand what it is.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256403933_f70f475791_o.jpg">
<p>
People carved their names on the tree. Older inscriptions are no longer embedded in the wood, but, on the contrary, have become convex.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256206261_b1b9018053_o.jpg">
<p>
Only large streets are marked on the city map. Between them are usually poor houses or slums. There are no numbering of houses, the names of the streets are arbitrary and it is impossible to navigate by them. Slums can be more decent, with a relatively wide street and shops, and poorer, with very narrow corridors instead of streets. There is only one house number sign in the entire city.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257248495_cb7bcbff8f_o.jpg">
<p>
The city seems to be actively being built up, but in some places you still can’t shake the feeling that something has clearly not been done completely.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257504049_321455637b_o.jpg">
<p>
This is especially noticeable if you go to a shopping center. In many of them, most of the retail space will be empty.
</p>

<p>
An important local feature is the dominance of barbed wire. It can appear in the most unexpected places.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256404093_8b4989e31f_o.jpg">
<p>
Why, for example, fence a public park, especially since five meters to the right there is a section of fence without barbed wire, where it is easy to climb over?
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256952869_4ca8523750_o.jpg">
<p>
For example, here barbed wire completely blocks the passage to the pedestrian crossing, making it even more pointless than usual.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256952949_2b22735878_o.jpg">
<p>
Barbed wire is needed not only to protect state property from theft, but also to separate the rich from the poor. The rich live behind high fences, and the poor clean their swimming pools with toothbrushes.

They say that Jakarta is an unsafe city; people get robbed on the street even during the day on wide avenues, and if you get into a poor area, they will not only rob you, but also kill you. Residents of Jakarta slums send warm regards to the paranoid.

On the first day I ended up in the slums by accident. We needed to find a bank to exchange money, but we still couldn’t find a bank, so in the end we made a decent detour until we found it, and decided to take a shortcut back. As a result, it turned out that getting through the slums was not so easy. Back then (thanks to my Russian upbringing) I still saw in every passerby a potential murderer, swindler or thief, so I didn’t take photographs. Moreover, I had three and a half million Indonesian rupees in my pocket. Later, however, I saw slums more than once. They are located between major roads, so from the map it seems that this is either a park or a block without streets. In fact, the streets are simply not marked; moreover, they do not have names or generally accepted numbering. A typical slum street looks something like this:
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255475682_0d1ce8bc68_o.jpg">
<p>
The slums, of course, also have their own shops for the poor. They are on wider aisles. As a result, mountains of boxes of unknown purpose are formed along the walls. For some reason, many store empty bottles.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255475337_e88a87e867_o.jpg">
<p>
The houses are a maximum of two floors high, made mainly from scrap materials, only part of the partitions are lined with stone.
</p>

<p>
There are no cars, it is too expensive and impractical. Motorcycles and bajajs are in use.

<p>
Somewhere here we sat down to play chess on the street. Although Indonesia is located in Asia, mostly European chess is played here, with the exception of the Chinese diaspora, among whom Chinese chess is, of course, popular. The Russia-Indonesia match ended in Russia's victory with a score of 2-0.

If we ignore the oriental flavor, life is very reminiscent of a communal apartment, only larger in size.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256404713_645c62e8ef_o.jpg">
<p>
Except that poultry doesn’t run around in communal apartments and anchors aren’t stored. Well, Indonesia is wide and spacious, you don’t have to throw anything away.
</p>

<p>
People here take a philosophical approach to throwing away garbage. Garbage is not thrown just anywhere, but in specially designated places. For example, under the bridge, where no one walks anyway except crazy tourists.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256404473_b5abd8b9ae_o.jpg">
<p>
The most suitable place for garbage is, of course, ponds. Everything from the slums flows here.

It’s easiest to take shocking shots near the canals.

The smoke is rising, everything is so harsh.

The sea in Jakarta is also not very clean. After this, even Crimea can be remembered with nostalgia.

This doesn't stop locals from trying to fish there.

Let's now go through the sights of Jakarta. Here is a panorama of the city center. Opposite each other is the main mosque (Indonesia is the largest Muslim country) and the church left over from the colonists.

A wedding was taking place in the church; in the yard there was a car, to which cans were tied on ropes so that they would rattle along the road. Inside there was a prayer in Indonesian.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256758391_2ffda23455_o.jpg">
<p>
The church even has a Catholic girls' school.

Like any self-respecting capital, Jakarta has a huge obelisk that is the butt of original jokes. It's called a "national monument". It was established by Suharto, the local Fuhrer, who, having come to power, did not fail to carry out mass executions, mainly against communists. It was the height of the Cold War, and the Americans did not bring democracy to Indonesia. Thirty years of dictatorship had a bad impact on the well-being of the country, as a result, the fourth most populous country in the world lags far behind in economic development, and almost no one knows anything about it. There is something in common here with Russia. Indonesia also seems to have pursued an aggressive foreign policy, attacked neighboring countries (for example, occupied East Timor), and maintains a huge army, but from a distance it doesn't look that impressive.

The central canal, photos of which are printed on postcards. I pay tribute, the water here is really cleaner than in other canals, but you still need to remove debris in Photoshop.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256205396_a67c2978dd_o.jpg">
<p>
There is a drawbridge over the canal. It is notable only for the fact that it is one of the oldest buildings in the city.

The old town with the Dutch colonial administration is completely different from the real Holland, more like Portugal. But it was definitely built by the Dutch; why the architecture is like this remains a mystery to me.

Surabaya street, a paradise for ragpickers. The first half of the street sells fake knives from Sumatra and Javanese figurines.

And on the second, for some reason, the suitcases, and sometimes vinyl records and golf clubs.

For richer people, there are a lot of huge sparkling shopping centers, where the prices in the stores are not even very low by Russian standards. Shopping centers have uniformed security guards, metal detectors and rows of taxis near the exits. Wealthy ladies come to do shopping.

At first glance, it may seem that Jakarta is a fairly green city. Some houses are literally surrounded by greenery.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257248015_022c45903b_o.jpg">

There are even undeveloped courtyards.

<p>
However, due to the huge number of cars, including those fueled with diesel fuel, this is not felt at all. There is absolutely nothing to breathe on the roads. This scene looks like planting aluminum cucumbers on a tarpaulin field. (<i>Reference to a popular song by Viktor Tsoy</i>)

<p>
In conclusion, a little about the residents of Jakarta. For obvious reasons, there are not very many pedestrians on the streets. At a minimum, because there is almost nowhere to sit.
</p>

People are very friendly towards tourists and react positively to the camera.

The week in Jakarta passed quickly and it was time to explore the island of Java.
