<h1>Bulgaria: Burgas, Nessebar, Kazanlak, Shipka, Gabrovo, Veliko Tarnovo, Varna</h1>
<i>27-30 August 2021</i>
<h2>Burgas</h2>
<p>
I have long wanted to go to Bulgaria and Romania, since these two Balkan countries were not explored in sufficient detail by me during the <a href="../bulgaria">big trip in 2014</a>. There is one time when it is ideal to fly to Bulgaria - late summer, when the beach season ends, and charter airlines sell tickets there for next to nothing, since they mainly need planes to take people back. You could buy a ticket for 3-4 thousand rubles ($50) even in 2021. I flew to the city of Burgas on the Black Sea coast, in the part of Bulgaria where I had not been before.

<p>
Bulgaria is still the most similar country to Russia in the Balkans.

The central streets are almost all pedestrian and look like a resort.
<p/>

<p>
All restaurants were open and there were no restrictions.

Architecturally, there are few beautiful buildings.

<p>
I wanted to go further by bus to the city of Sliven, but it turned out that the schedules on the Internet were incorrect, and there was no bus there at the time I expected. In Bulgaria, you should always check the schedule at the bus station.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51501914342_295869f184_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I went back to the railway station and took the train to Kazanlak, at the same time I saw for the first time what Bulgarian trains look like.

<h2>Nessebar</h2>
<p>
The only town in Bulgaria included in the World Heritage List is small Nessebar on the Black Sea coast near Burgas.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51502933278_13dc60918b_h.jpg"/>

<p>
Nessebar stands on a small peninsula connected by a thin isthmus to the mainland (in the distance).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51502705736_dce89641ad_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The beach resort Sunny Beach (Slanchev Bryag) was built near Nessebar. Judging by the map, there are only large hotels there, and all the restaurants and the party scene are in Nessebar.

<p>
The modern part of Nessebar on the mainland is not particularly interesting.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51503633695_425bc136d3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
All the most interesting things are on the peninsula.

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51502933538_ebc529f6c5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There were quite a lot of tourists. There is no need to wear masks in Bulgaria, so it looks indistinguishable from 2019. Nice atmosphere.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51503424104_aa61868db9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The old town is partly residential, there is even a school with a sports ground.

<p>
Prices in a tourist restaurant. To get euros, divide by two. As you can see, even the most expensive dishes here are around 10 euros, which is cheap.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51503633385_45806bc7a0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I had dinner at the restaurant at my hotel, about 6 euros. Rakia costs about 1 euro.

<h2>Kazanlak</h2>
<p>
From Burgas I went to the city of Kazanlak that lies immediately south of the Balkan Range. From the train, looking north, you can see these small mountains for most of the road.
<p/>

<p>
We pass the city of Sliven, where I wanted to go by bus, but couldn’t.

Outskirts of Kazanlak. It looks like some kind of ghetto due to the fact that everything around the house is littered.

Kazanlak station. In Bulgarian it is written with the letter Ъ, which means a very short “o” (in Russian it is not pronounced).

In appearance, the most posh establishment in the city is the New York bar.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51503425114_a4b305b1ce_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Had dinner there for about 5 euros with wine.
<p/>

I also bought raspberries at the market.

<p>
In the morning I went to see the main attraction of this city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51502706821_c077094b3d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This Thracian tomb is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This is the tomb of a local ruler who lived in the 4th century BC, that is, even before these lands became part of the Roman Empire. The photo shows a dome protecting the tomb itself, located underground.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51503425239_6321d3c822_h.jpg"/>
<p>
To prevent damage to the frescoes, there is no entrance there, but an exact copy has been made next door.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51503634710_6950d40beb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It looks like this: a corridor three meters long and a round room a couple of meters in diameter.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51502706666_e6e22645ec_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The frescoes were preserved on the ceiling.

<h2>Shipka</h2>
<p>
Shipka is a small town on the southern slopes of the Balkans near the pass of the same name. An important battle took place here in the Russian-Turkish War of 1877-1878.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51501905837_17dff1294b_h.jpg"/>

<p>
I took a minibus from Kazanlak. Along the way I saw a Soviet-style monument with the colors of the Bulgarian flag.
<p/>

There is a monument here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51502702831_20337f1478_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In 1923, there was an attempt at a communist coup, which was suppressed, but after the war, under communist rule, monuments began to be erected everywhere in its honor.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51503421294_3f7cd51f74_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Shipka consists of one-story houses on a hill.

<h2>Gabrovo</h2>
<p>
Gabrovo is a small town in the mountains. In Bulgaria there are a lot of jokes about people of Gabrovo, the essence of which is that the locals are very stingy, something like this: “In Gabrovo when they eat fish, they collect bones, and then use them instead of toothpicks.”
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51501912197_062dbca8df_h.jpg"/>

<p>
Gabrovo is located immediately north of the Shipka Pass.

Cats are a symbol of the city. Apparently, because of the joke about how they cut off their tails so that they can come through the door faster in winter and waste less heat.

<h2>Veliko Tarnovo</h2>
<p>
The most beautiful city in Bulgaria is Veliko Tarnovo, an ancient capital from the times when Bulgaria was great and occupied half of the Balkan Peninsula (before the Ottoman Empire appeared there).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51502699241_d5441dbbb3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This city has a very unusual topography - the river makes several bends, eventually turning 180 degrees, so that the city is sandwiched on both sides, and here it is not a plain, but a real canyon, so the river is far below, and the city is on the high banks . The <a href="../bern">Swiss capital</a> has a similar layout, but here the shape of the territory skirted by the river is more complex.
<p/>

<p>
You walk along a narrow street between rows of houses, then a cliff begins on one side and this view opens up.
<p/>

<p>
This is the Tsarevets fortress - the ancient Bulgarian capital. On the left, on the other bank, there is a continuation of it - the remains of walls surround the former city.

The fortress is very large, but now quite empty - once it was a city, but only the ruins of the main buildings such as the royal palace have been preserved.

Market. For some reason, they hung up a stupid ribbon, like for everyone to walk in the same direction, because this is somehow supposed to protect against coronavirus according to someone’s flawed logic. But naturally, no one cares.

<h2>Varna</h2>

Varna is the second large city on the coast with an airport, where cheap flights fly in the summer. It is the third largest city in the country after <a href="../bulgaria">Sofia</a> and <a href="../bulgaria">Plovdiv</a >.
