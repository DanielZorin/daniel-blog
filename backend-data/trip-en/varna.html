<h1>Bulgaria: Burgas, Nessebar, Kazanlak, Shipka, Gabrovo, Veliko Tarnovo, Varna</h1>
<i>27-30 August 2021</i>
<h2>Burgas</h2>
<p>
I have long wanted to go to Bulgaria and Romania, since these two Balkan countries were not explored in sufficient detail by me during the <a href="http://goo.gl/eQJy8q">big trip in 2014</a>. There is one time when it is ideal to fly to Bulgaria - late summer, when the beach season ends, and charter airlines sell tickets there for next to nothing, since they mainly need planes to take people back. You could buy a ticket for 3-4 thousand rubles ($50) even in 2021. I flew to the city of Burgas on the Black Sea coast, in the part of Bulgaria where I had not been before.

<p>
Bulgaria is still the most similar country to Russia in the Balkans.

I wanted to go further by bus to the city of Sliven, but it turned out that the schedules on the Internet were incorrect, and there was no bus there at the time I expected. In Bulgaria, you should always check the schedule at the bus station.

I went back to the railway station and took the train to Kazanlak, at the same time I saw for the first time what Bulgarian trains look like.

<h2>Nessebar</h2>
<p>
The only town in Bulgaria included in the World Heritage List is small Nessebar on the Black Sea coast near Burgas.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51502933278_7958f96503_o.jpg">

<p>
Nessebar stands on a small peninsula connected by a thin isthmus to the mainland (in the distance).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51502705736_4009d02578_o.jpg">
<p>
The beach resort Sunny Beach (Slanchev Bryag) was built near Nessebar. Judging by the map, there are only large hotels there, and all the restaurants and the party scene are in Nessebar.

<p>
There were quite a lot of tourists. There is no need to wear masks in Bulgaria, so it looks indistinguishable from 2019. Nice atmosphere.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51503424104_8765c20838_o.jpg">
<p>
The old town is partly residential, there is even a school with a sports ground.

Prices in a tourist restaurant. To get euros, divide by two. As you can see, even the most expensive dishes here are around 10 euros, which is cheap.
<p/>

<h2>Kazanlak</h2>
<p>
From Burgas I went to the city of Kazanlak that lies immediately south of the Balkan Range. From the train, looking north, you can see these small mountains for most of the road.

<p>
This Thracian tomb is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This is the tomb of a local ruler who lived in the 4th century BC, that is, even before these lands became part of the Roman Empire. The photo shows a dome protecting the tomb itself, located underground.

<h2>Shipka</h2>
<p>
Shipka is a small town on the southern slopes of the Balkans near the pass of the same name. An important battle took place here in the Russian-Turkish War of 1877-1878.
<p/>

I took a minibus from Kazanlak. Along the way I saw a Soviet-style monument with the colors of the Bulgarian flag.

In 1923, there was an attempt at a communist coup, which was suppressed, but after the war, under communist rule, monuments began to be erected everywhere in its honor.

<h2>Gabrovo</h2>
<p>
Gabrovo is a small town in the mountains. In Bulgaria there are a lot of jokes about people of Gabrovo, the essence of which is that the locals are very stingy, something like this: “In Gabrovo when they eat fish, they collect bones, and then use them instead of toothpicks.”
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51501912197_b5f4f0c51a_o.jpg">

Gabrovo is located immediately north of the Shipka Pass.

Cats are a symbol of the city. Apparently, because of the joke about how they cut off their tails so that they can come through the door faster in winter and waste less heat.

<h2>Veliko Tarnovo</h2>
<p>
The most beautiful city in Bulgaria is Veliko Tarnovo, an ancient capital from the times when Bulgaria was great and occupied half of the Balkan Peninsula (before the Ottoman Empire appeared there).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51502699241_27feb644b3_o.jpg">
<p>
This city has a very unusual topography - the river makes several bends, eventually turning 180 degrees, so that the city is sandwiched on both sides, and here it is not a plain, but a real canyon, so the river is far below, and the city is on the high banks . The <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/656066.html">Swiss capital</a> has a similar layout, but here the shape of the territory skirted by the river is more complex.
<p/>

You walk along a narrow street between rows of houses, then a cliff begins on one side and this view opens up.

This is the Tsarevets fortress - the ancient Bulgarian capital. On the left, on the other bank, there is a continuation of it - the remains of walls surround the former city.
