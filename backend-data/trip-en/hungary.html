<h1>Hungary: Budapest</h1>
<i>25-30 November 2012</i>
<h2>Budapest</h2>
<p>
Hungary is an amazing country. In it, unlike its neighbors, the spirit of the old, depressive, Soviet-era Eastern Europe is still alive, with gray panel houses, gloomy tense faces and nostalgic memories of a brilliant past. Visually, this is the most backward country in Europe that I have ever been to (though I have not been almost anywhere in the Balkans yet), and is most similar to the Russia of my childhood from the nineties. Since then, wide roads, huge train stations made of glass and concrete, and high-rise luxury residential complexes have been built in Russia, while in Hungary the Soviet atmosphere remains, in which, after the advent of capitalism, the population earns money through petty scams.

The first impression of Budapest - yes, this is like St. Petersburg, Liteiny Prospekt!

The second impression of Budapest looks like this.

Directly opposite this house is an atypical view of Budapest.

The path near this transformer is not a sidewalk at all, as one might think.

This is a parking lot.

The center of Budapest is a paradise for all kinds of swindlers and thieves. Here, for example, is an exchange office where they give about 220 forints for a euro, while the real exchange rate is around 280. In Moscow, there was no such impudence even under Yeltsin. I can hardly imagine why this company continues to rent a bunch of offices in the center of Budapest. It is best to exchange currency away from the capital, for example, in Slovakia.

For the first time in my life I saw thimbleweeds. I was sure that this only exists in books about Ostap Bender, but the Hungarians opened my eyes. Do they really manage to earn their living this way? In my opinion, going to work as a cleaner in England would be a much more noble decision.

The metro in Budapest is a circus. It looks less like a mode of transport and more like an attraction for tourists. Of the three lines, only one looks like a modern one, and the only station with a transfer is amazingly designed in such a way that it is not obvious where to go. But there is a panel.
<p/>

The second line looks like Moscow metro from thirty years ago.

There are inscriptions in Russian inside.

The third line has been standing for more than a hundred years.

Small trains ride along it, almost like in amusement parks.

Rare trolleybuses travel on the ground, as in some provincial Russian capitals.

The trams are not bad. The fare is a little more than in the Czech Republic - 45 rubles/$1.5 per trip.
<p/>

It is worth noting that the schedule is very good, like in the Czech Republic.

Railway station. They tried to borrow the equipment from Germany, as well as some of the trains. The good old trains also still run.

Homelessness in Europe is no surprise; the further south the country, the more of them there are.

Russia is not liked here since 1956. The memory of the uprising plays a role similar to the cult of the 1945 Victory in our country. In memory of those who died, monuments and billboards are hung at every step.

Personally, I did not feel sorry for Hungary (unlike the Czech Republic or Lithuania). They themselves went out to support the Nazis and got well deserved for it. The reason for Hitler's support was due to the unprecedented level of revanchism that is visible even now. More than 90 years have passed since the Treaty of Trianon, and the Imperials still portray Hungary as owning most of Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Transylvania, although most of these territories are not inhabited by Hungarians. I bought a similar toy with the inscription “For God and the Motherland!”

The surest sign of a failed empire is neon stars on streetlights. I saw the same ones in <a href="../morocco1">Morocco</a> and in <a href="../dmitrov">Russia</a>.

Budapest is a bit like Vienna in the number of solemn monuments, although there is less gilding. Apparently, the two parts of Austria-Hungary tried not to lose to each other.
<p/>

<p>
Mostly the monuments are black and gloomy, like the whole country.
<p/>

<p>
As in Vienna, sometimes statues are hung directly on gray facades.

The main monument is the Turul bird, which according to legend led the Hungarians to the Danube. It’s like our monument to Lenin, it’s a must in every city. In the city of Tatabanya, which I passed by by train, the statue is 15 meters wide and can be seen even from the train station, which is quite far from the mountain where the statue stands. In Budapest, Turul stands near the Buda Palace.

Next to it in the courtyard of the synagogue is a cemetery.

Monument to Anonymous. It seems to be a Hungarian tradition to depict the anonymous person as a man with a hood pulled over his eyes (rather than wearing a Guy Fawkes mask).

In Hungarian parks, leaves are not removed in the fall. On the one hand it is beautiful.

On the other hand, it’s not very pleasant if it rains.

When it's not raining, the view of the city is pretty ok.

What's good about Budapest is hotels. I lived on the main street in an old house for about 35 euro a day, the price of the cheapest hotel in the Russian province or a hostel for migrant workers in Moscow. The house had a grand staircase, an antique elevator, a courtyard and interior balconies.

In Budapest, as in Vilnius, there is a museum of KGB dungeons. It looks very clumsy and is called “house of horrors”.

There are special spam boxes hanging on the entrance doors, on which advertisements are also pasted.
<p/>

They also put spam in there in batches.

When renaming, the old sign is crossed out in red. This square, by the way, was renamed last year. I wonder why Roosevelt didn’t please them?

The Hungarian language is very interesting. Learning to read words is easy, you just need to get used to the fact that s = [sh], and sz = [s]. I have an old three-volume Hungarian textbook at home, written back in Soviet times, and I once mastered quite a few chapters from it. As a result, words and roots constantly surfaced in my memory. I think my vocabulary is at least a couple hundred words. In my subjective opinion, Hungarian is easier and more logical than Finnish or Estonian. As in all other countries where English is not the de facto official language (except Germany, Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries), almost no one speaks English.

Well, the most unexpected beauty in Budapest is the manholes. They are all shiny and decorated with patterns.
