<h1>Russia: Gorokhovets, Nizhny Novgorod, Arzamas</h1>
<i>14-15 August 2018</i>
<h2>Gorokhovets</h2>
<p>
Gorokhovets in the Vladimir region is perhaps one of the most beautiful small towns in Russia.
<p/>

<p>
High-speed trains from Moscow to Nizhny Novgorod stop in Gorokhovets; you can get there in just two hours. Though the station is 15 kilometers from the city, you still need to get there by bus or taxi.
<p/>

<p>
The city center is perfectly preserved. The main square really looks a bit empty; in theory, there was once trade on it, but now there are only cars.

<p>
Interestingly, on the other side there are no residential or commercial buildings at all. There is only one monastery, and there is forest for kilometers around.

<p>
Returning to the center, I headed to the top of the hill. At the rise there is an old statue of a worker with a torch.
<p/>

<p>
At the foot of the hill there is also a factory for the production of elevators - in the past the city-forming enterprise. There is also a monument to Lenin.

<p>
In addition to churches, Gorokhovets has an unusually large number of luxurious 18th- and 19th-century mansions built by local wealthy entrepreneurs.

<p>
There are also mansions quite far from the center, right next to the highway.

<h2>Nizhny Novgorod</h2>
<p>
I was in Nizhny in <a href="../nizhny-novgorod">2013</a>, but I have long wanted to return there - it is one of the most beautiful and interesting cities in central Russia. Last time, one of the important omissions was that I did not have time to ride the Nizhny Novgorod metro (but I did ride the cable car to Bor). The metro has two lines, and both run along the left bank of the Oka through industrial areas, only one station is on the right bank near the historical center - Gorkovskaya. This station opened in November 2012, but for some reason in the summer of 2013 I didn’t know about it - perhaps my paper map was out of date at that time.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257611305_7026b666e6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The main station is called "Moskovskaya" - it is near the station, and here is the intersection of two lines.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257611045_4e70371b38_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Most of the stations in Nizhny are shallow, so there are stairs parallel to the escalators, and above them there are various panels everywhere.
<p/>

<p>
The final station of the Sormovsko-Meshcherskaya line is “Burevestnik”. It is generally terrestrial. Although the line is called Sormovskaya, it never reached the Sormovsky district. It only has 5 stops.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255840737_1c56bbaabc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Near the Burevestnik station there are three monuments to Lenin.
<p/>

<p>
One of them is super picturesque - it stands on the territory of a former factory, where there are now shops, warehouses and car services, in the middle of a field overgrown with weeds.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257611210_f395d87700_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Also here I discovered a branch of the Higher School of Economics.

<p>
Payment for single metro trips are with tokens (there are also transport cards for local residents). The token costs 28 rubles. Interestingly, Nizhny Novgorod tokens were accepted by turnstiles in St. Petersburg, which is why they were taken there en masse (after all, travel in St. Petersburg is more expensive!). Ultimately, the Nizhny Novgorod tokens were made with a hole in the middle.
<p/>

<p>
Station "Park Kultury" is the terminus of the longer Avtozavodskaya line.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256569181_224e1840b0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a rather interesting area called Sotsgorod - built in the 1930s, one might say that these are the commieblocks of a healthy person (and not a smoker).

<p>
The next few stops on the metro are in a huge industrial area. The Gorky Automobile Plant (GAZ) where they produce Gazelle minibuses is located here. Yes, Nizhny Novgorod in Soviet times was called “Gorky”, in my opinion, of all the Soviet names it was the ugliest and most absurd, it’s good that the old name was returned.

<p>
Almost all metro stations on this line have names associated with communism: Leninskaya, Proletarskaya, Komsomolskaya, etc. The most unusual name is the station "Engine of the Revolution".

This station has the most absurd navigation in the world. In general, in Russia there is a strange tradition of numbering platforms and tracks at train stations, which only confuses (all over the world only tracks are numbered). But in Nizhny, the numbering of paths is not in order, but in some random way. Opposite the first path is the fifth, 2-4 somewhere else and so on.

<h2>Arzamas</h2>
<p>
The city of Arzamas in the south of the Nizhny Novgorod region is included in the list of historical cities of Russia, so I set my sights on going there from Nizhny. It took me three hours to get there by train from the center, and an hour and a half back by minibus (to the bus station on the outskirts). There are two train stations in Arzamas, and both are not very close to the center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256877200_e61db98fb2_h.jpg"/>

<p>
Arzamas has an unusual coat of arms consisting of only two lines. Symbolizes the victory of Moscow (red corner) over the Horde (green) in the 16th century.

<p>
We are approaching the historical center. There is a large residential area, classic Russian wooden houses with carved windows.

<p>
The architecture here is not protected at all. Those who are richer take and remodel their piece of the house, covering it with siding.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256877405_ca50d0e87e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here a rich man lives in a basement. Well, rich enough to buy the cheapest siding, but not rich enough to support a wooden house.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255834196_5a47e91eaa_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Siding in the form of logs is still too bright and noticeable.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256035983_ee152fb692_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The city center itself consists of several streets around a shopping area, where the buildings are made of stone.

It has a very atypical interior for Russian churches. Easily confused with a Catholic cathedral.

The market is now not on the main square, where cars drive, but right behind it. I took the opportunity and bought a large jar of blueberries for a very low (compared to Moscow) price.
