<h1>Malaysia: Kuala Lumpur</h1>
<i>22-23 October, 5-11 November 2015, 14-18 April, 9-29 June 2016</i>
<h2>Kuala Lumpur</h2>
<p>
If <a href="../bangkok">Bangkok</a> starts from Khaosan Road, then Kuala Lumpur starts from Petaling Street.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255570587_114a5cef2e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is a Muslim country, so there are no discos with beer and loud music right on the street, just a market and many hotels.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255570642_bc8b86e341_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I regularly stayed on Petaling Road at the Sasana Hotel, right at the gate. 45 ringgit for a single room, 60 ringgit for a double room, with air conditioning and shower. I haven't found better value for money in the area.
<p/>

<p>
In this hotel you can go out onto the roof, where bed linen is usually dried.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257344295_eeea2df503_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Petaling Street itself is covered with a canopy on top.
<p/>

<p>
In the evening, red Chinese lanterns light up there.
<p/>

<p>
Trade ends much earlier than on Khao San - around midnight the stalls are closed and taken away, the street is empty. Some restaurants, however, are open 24 hours a day, as are 7-11.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255571927_433db55176_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The prices at the market are quite normal, I often bought fruit there (mostly in the stalls on the parallel Sultan Street).
<p/>

<p>
The area is sort of Chinese, so there are a lot of very authentic Chinese eateries here. Prices are lower than in China - $1-2 per dish. The peculiarity of canteens is that there are several different food outlets on the same area with seats, and drinks are served centrally. Usually, to sit, you need to order some kind of drink, for example, excellent Malay tea Teh tarik for 1.5-2 ringgit ($0.3-0.5).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255570882_04d58c6860_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The food is just like in China, amazing.

<p>
In addition to the Chinese, there are also Indians here (although in KL there is a special Indian quarter near the central station). You can eat here around the clock, either roti pancakes or chicken curry, washed down with the same tarik tea.

<p>
A durian trading point is painted on the wall. Durians on Petaling Street are expensive to buy, there are better places: Alor Street, and some even better ones - I’ll tell you about them later.
<p/>

An advertisement for Radio Era is painted at the intersection. This photo was taken on April 18, 2016.

And this one is there on June 13th. The advertisement has been redrawn.

It's difficult to catch a good sunset in Kuala Lumpur - too many buildings block the view.

Immediately after Chinatown, old colonial Kuala Lumpur begins, more on that next time.

Kuala Lumpur is 100 years younger than Bangkok; this city was founded in the second half of the 19th century to develop tin mining in this region. The British built a number of ceremonial buildings here, most of which are concentrated on Freedom Square.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257342495_13f7c1f865_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The clock tower does not stand alone, but is built into the ensemble.

<p>
You can also add Kuala Lumpur Central Station here (on the diagram it is called Kuala Lumpur).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257048424_c405458c2e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Now it is used as a regular station where local trains and most long-distance trains stop. The main station is called KL Sentral.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256499658_a7dc14ac1b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Opposite the station is a gigantic railway office, which does not really correspond to the scale of the Malaysian network, consisting of two lines, on which trains run quite rarely - 2-3 times a day, except for the KL - Ipoh route.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257342850_c376c24f19_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Kuala Lumpur is built at the confluence of the Klang and Gombak rivers, but it’s hard to guess because both rivers flow in the backyards, and along them there are overpasses and metro lines built, instead of embankments with benches.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257342795_1683a4d27b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Only rare graffiti artists wander here.

<p>
Many other cities in Malaysia, founded at the same time, look similar - Ipoh, Seremban, Kuala Selangor.

<p>
Historically, Malaysia has three large communities. In addition to the Malays (and a very small number of indigenous people), there are the Chinese, who historically did business in this region on the east-west sea route, and Indians who came from another British colony, India.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256302381_5c64edd992_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Therefore, here you can see mosques, pagodas and Indian temples.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256302361_49da74d0a5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In Malaysia, there is legislatively enshrined positive discrimination of ethnic Malays - there are quotas for them in business, education, and management; Malays also receive a 7% discount when purchasing real estate. This policy was introduced to redistribute wealth from the Chinese, who predominantly lived in large cities and ran all serious business. The occasion was the massacre between Malays and Chinese in Kuala Lumpur in May 1969.
<p/>

<p>
It is impossible to become a “Malay” (officially this is called the word “bumiputra” = Malays   indigenous people of Borneo), the privilege is given at birth from Malay parents. Also, Malaysia has different laws for Muslims and non-Muslims. Every person has their religion written in their passport. To obtain privileges for Malays, in addition to having the right parents, it is imperative to profess Islam.

<p>
In addition to the colonial buildings in the center, Kuala Lumpur has another place founded in the 19th century - the Hindu temple in Batu Caves on the northern outskirts of the city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257809980_08a0779f71_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is a fairly popular and easily accessible place - located at the final train stop.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257048824_db3a847e93_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The temple was built in a karst cave, which is often found in Southeast Asia.

The most recognizable place in Kuala Lumpur is, of course, the Petronas Towers, the tallest building in the world from 1998 to 2004 (before the construction of <a href="../taiwan">Taipei 101</ a>). The area around is called KLCC = Kuala Lumpur City Center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257344090_cce2da67f1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On my first visit to Kuala Lumpur there was terrible smog, the towers were blurry.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256301481_7e11214b78_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Subsequently, I walked near the towers many times - there are free bus stops and shopping centers nearby.

<p>
You can go upstairs for 20 dollars. Probably the best solution would be to go to the observation deck in the TV tower for $10 - from there the Petronas Towers will be visible. I haven’t gotten around to it in a month, I’ll have to go next time.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255572157_cb3396d3e9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Inside there is a large shopping center, as well as the Petrosains science museum, and in the annex there is an aquarium, which is worthy of a separate discussion.

<p>
Monorail line nearby.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256303011_baaaf7f3a9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You can walk along covered walkways from the Petronas Towers to the largest shopping center - Pavillion.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257048774_1a7952a7d2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are three free bus lines, including one to Petaling Road. In the Pavilion itself, shopping is at the highest level: Dolce & Gabbana, Michael Kors, Louboutins. On the ground floor there is a supermarket, it is more expensive there, but you can buy jamon, cheese, and even pork.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256502078_0a5f4e7aa4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Just for shopping, I usually went to the supermarket of the main Malaysian chain Giant, near the Bukit Bintang monorail station. By the way, there in the evening you can buy packs of sushi on sale for 9 ringgit ($2.2) per box of a dozen pieces - more expensive than in Thailand, but still inexpensive.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256501978_4e2d86451d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Malay fashion. For girls, the main disadvantage is that there are no outerwear without sleeves; walking on the street in Asia will be quite hot. In general, there is a good selection there, and the prices are very attractive. Cheaper than Indonesia.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256303676_2a27dacf05_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are also many shopping centers here, but from older times.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257050559_c60b37f18d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
An important place is Low Yat Plaza, the main electronics store. Prices and selection are good.

It is also the center of nightlife.

In addition to the Pavilion, there is another giant mall - Berjaya Times Square.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255576872_50b0b7ffa7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The shopping there is not elite; on the lower floors there are even stalls with cheap shoes.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256505438_b754ccf2dd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And on the top floor there is an amusement park with a roller coaster!

<p>
For two weeks I rented a room through airbnb in the Kampung Bahru (“new village”) area. Despite the name, it is very close to the center - the Petronas Tower is two stops by metro or 25 minutes on foot (so long because you need to walk to the only bridge over the river in the area).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255574877_256f34ab2e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I recommend Airbnb in Kuala Lumpur - cheaper and better than a hotel. The room cost $10 per day.

To get to KLCC you need to walk across the bridge. There are several more levels of overpasses on top.

One of the disadvantages of the condominium is that there is not a single grocery store right next to it, you need to go to Giant. No 7-11 to buy Butterfly Ice Cream. Fruit, however, can be bought on the corner. There is also an Indian canteen with prices lower than in Chinatown. Roti pancakes for RM1.30.

There seems to be a shopping center near the nearest Damai metro station, but it is almost empty. Near it there is a good market with cheap kebabs.

<p>
If you go west from Damai towards Kampung Baru MRT there is an even bigger market.

And finally, the Chow Kit district itself is the second Chinatown and part-time red light district, where Chinese brothels are based.

Kuala Lumpur has a very cool metro. In addition to the fact that it looks beautiful from the outside on overpasses, inside you can walk into the first carriage and look forward as if from the driver’s seat.

Kuala Lumpur has three metro lines, one monorail line and three city train lines (including the airport train). The monorail costs more than the metro, but it has the best views of the city center because it winds through all the interesting areas above.

I used the third metro line only to get to the bus station. Previously, the bus station was located near Petaling Street in the city center, but now nothing goes from there, all buses depart from TBS (Bandar Tasik Selatan metro). Buses from Titiwangsa MRT still run to the east coast.

On the top floor of the Petronas Towers shopping mall is the Petrosains Science Museum. The main task is to show where oil comes from and how it is extracted (Petronas is an oil company), but besides this there are many different things that illustrate physical experiments. It is interesting not only for school-age children, but also for adults who have never seen anything like this before due to the lack of analogues in Russia.

I've never been to an aquarium before. Until recently, there was no aquarium in Moscow, but in other cities I missed it too. In Southeast Asia, there are large aquariums in Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. There is no clear opinion about which one is better. I visited the Malaysian one.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256502323_7424132d0f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The aquarium is located in a building adjacent to the Petronas Towers. I walked through it many times on the way somewhere, and often there was a long line even at the entrance, but on day X there were very few people, no one bothered each other. Entrance costs 60 ringgit ($15).
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256304811_04775abced_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At the entrance you can pick up a brochure that shows feeding times for different fish. Most fish are fed twice a day, morning and evening, so in half a day you can see them all in action. I only missed the octopus, which spent the entire afternoon sleeping, huddled in a corner. There is an aquarium with piranhas right at the entrance.
<p/>

Petaling Jaya is the closest suburb of Kuala Lumpur from the west. It's easy to get there using the pink metro line. This city was originally founded as a suburb to provide people with living space, so there is no center here, instead there are "sections" from 1 to 7 with a street grid.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257050269_2500d419aa_h.jpg"/>

Only the park around the lake near Taman Jaya station can claim to be the center.

And you come somewhere to Taman Bahagia, and you see almost a little America there.
<p/>

<p>
Only the houses are close together. America will really be in the next suburb of Subang Jaya, which is considered more expensive and elite.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257050329_7a17af42c3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Unlike real America, there are shops on large streets, and not one mall for 10 kilometers.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256303471_ec38064dfb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But few people really walk here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256501638_5531f429c5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And the streets are called numbers.

<p>
Besides idle curiosity, what brought me to Petaling Jaya was the desire to taste durians. In the SS2 area there are two main points of trade for these divine fruits - Donald's Durian and Durian SS2. They are located literally a five-minute walk from each other, the nearest metro station is a 30-minute walk, but there are free buses around Petaling Jaya, just like in Kuala Lumpur.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256303571_c59193fe99_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Donalds is a store, and SS2 is a street stall like a watermelon one. Both offer a buffet - for 25-30 ringgits per person you can eat as many durians as you like. Considering that the cheapest cost 12 ringgit per kilogram including peel, this is a very good deal.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255573232_9e858f00a4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Of course, you can’t eat the most elite varieties like Musang King, which costs 50 ringgit per kilo, at the buffet.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256505508_aec6b0558c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But regular durians are also good. Both establishments have plenty of different varieties.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255573177_893aaa7b2d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Different varieties of durian differ quite greatly in taste. To become a connoisseur, you need to taste them for a long time in different seasons.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257344620_aaede214ef_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Tip - bring a bottle of water with you to refresh yourself after each durian.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256505528_a37ef85327_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It was experimentally determined that I can eat four durians at a time, and Alena can only eat two.

On the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur there is a place that is the complete opposite of the dense metropolis: Crab Island (Pulau Ketam). From the center you can get there in about an hour and a half: first by KTM commuter train to the final station of Port Klang, from there by ferry for 7 ringgit. And there is a fishing village on stilts.

Kuala Lumpur is close to the sea, but there are no beaches for many kilometers of the coast. The capital of Malaysia is called the “Dirty Estuary” for a reason - along the coast there is clay and mangroves.

Crabs like it. The island is called crab island for a reason - if you look down under the piles, there will be a bunch of crabs.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256305816_7e5ea59081_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But such soil is not suitable for humans, so everything on the island in the village is built on stilts.

Infrastructure is concentrated at the intersection: restaurants, shops, a club.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256504208_3a5e85ac23_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a bank branch and an ATM. And I also saw at least two hotels, quite inexpensive.

It does not go far into the island, where thickets of trees begin. This is the end of the street.

Kuala Lumpur is surrounded by the state of Selangor. Like many other states in Malaysia, it is a sultanate with its own dynasty. The capital of the state of Selangor is the city of Shah Alam, and the residence of the Sultan is in the city of Klang (a common situation in other states). Both cities are easy to visit using the KTM train and are close to each other.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255576357_1767ba81a5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
First I went to further Klang, on the way back from Crab Island. This is a typical Malay town with a small colonial center of the first half of the 20th century.
<p/>

The street sign is duplicated in Arabic letters - a common occurrence in the Malaysian province.

From time to time there are beautiful buildings.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256504493_011b4debfb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The ubiquitous inscription Daulat Tuanku is something like “God Save the King!” Sultan, that is. Most tourists, however, do not see these signs because the main tourist cities of Kuala Lumpur, Malacca, Georgetown are not in the sultanates, and Borneo does not have sultans either.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256504528_541127e2b6_h.jpg"/>

Klang has beautiful lanterns decorated with a traditional Malay dagger.

And here is the Sultan's palace. You can only see it from the outside, of course.

In Shah Alam, the train station is located somewhere in the industrial zone; fortunately, there are free buses to the center. There are two interesting places here. Firstly, this is a street art street.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257053744_f278c75ba2_h.jpg"/>

<h2>Kuala Selangor</h2>
<p>
Kuala Selangor can be called a suburb of Kuala Lumpur with a stretch - after all, it takes two hours to get there, albeit by direct commuter bus from the very center. There is no pretense here, like in Klang and Shah Alam. This is a real province.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255588752_da2f8d9439_h.jpg"/>
<p>
After checking into the Zande Motel for 40 ringgit, I explored the city. The city is one square with these rows of houses, and several more streets around. There is another hotel on the main square, cheaper, but with worse rooms. There were, however, no staff there - it was as if everyone had died out.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255588722_cbe383bf86_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are also blocks around the bus station.

Most tourists visit Kuala Selangor to watch the fireflies after sunset. Fireflies live along the banks of the river upstream. There are two places where you can rent a boat. One is located about 10 kilometers from the city, so you need a taxi. There the price is 50 ringit for the whole boat (maximum for four). The second place is within walking distance just in the Chinese village - there for foreigners the price is 40 ringit per person. For the Malays - 18, which is written about in words for conspiracy (Lapan belas ringgit).

Kuala Selangor is quite an interesting option for a one-day trip from Kuala Lumpur if you have already been to Malacca and Putrajaya.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256320271_f481afb95d_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Путраджая</h2>
<p>
The city of Putrajaya is the artificially created new capital of Malaysia (more precisely, the seat of government). It has the main disadvantage of all such cities - the disproportion between the scale of architecture and the number of people. Putrajaya is good for taking pictures from a helicopter, since the central streets are quite empty.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256875308_341b742cbc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I also chose the wrong time for the trip - a day off. Expensive trains to the airport stop in Putrajaya, but it is much cheaper to take the RM5 bus from Mydin Supermarket.
<p/>

Midday. The heat is  40. All residents left, some to work, some to relax in Kuala Lumpur. There are almost no cars.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257716340_223d91e071_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On weekends, buses rarely ran through the city. It’s not close to the center from the bus station, about two kilometers. During all this time I did not see a single store.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257716270_c1a5db0c8e_h.jpg"/>

Near it there is a small shopping center with a food court, where you can eat and cool off under the air conditioning, otherwise even an experience peson like me would melt down. I took some cendol, a Malay dessert. It's strange - it looks like ice cream, but there are noodles at the bottom! I had to eat the noodles separately and the ice cream separately.

By the way, a little further on the hill there is an elite five-star hotel of the Shangri-La chain, where you can rent a room for only 60-70 dollars - cheaper than anywhere else in the world. A five-star hotel for almost the price of a bed in a bedbug infested den in the USA!

The rain still hit me, fortunately, I was able to wait for the city bus to the bus station.
