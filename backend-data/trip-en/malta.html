<h1>Malta</h1>
<i>15-16 March 2014</i>
<h2>Valletta</h2>
<p>
I was in Malta for two days on the way from <a href="../nice">Marseille</a> to <a href="../milan">Milan</a>. Two flights on Ryanair cost around €80, which is roughly the same price as a bus ticket and much cheaper than a train. I expected Malta to be the second <a href="../cyprus">Cyprus</a>, that is, a faceless gray small island country where people go to lie on the beach and learn English. It turned out to be exactly the opposite: Malta is an amazing, unique country in which you can spend time with great interest. I really regretted that there was so little time.

Prices contribute a lot to a positive impression of Malta. Malta is very cheap by European standards. For a measly one and a half euros you can buy a day pass for all buses on the island! The hotel cost 15 euros. There are a lot of negative reviews about it on booking.com, which were apparently written by clowns with inadequate expectations. In fact, it was one of the best hotels I've ever been to, for such a price, with a huge room that even had a kitchen, plus a good breakfast in the morning. In summer the price is 3-4 times higher, but there is no point in going to Malta in summer - it is very hot, lying on the beach there is simply criminal when there is so much beauty around. Spring or autumn is best. The only thing that was confirmed from the reviews is that the reception may not be able to cope with the flow of clients, sometimes I had to wait for 5 minutes, but this is expected, since the hotel has as many as 800 rooms (usually the hotels where I stay have no more than 20 rooms). This hotel is also located relatively far from Valletta, about 30-40 minutes drive. The place is called Paceville (c is pronounced as English "ch", the Italian way), this is the main party place in Malta, at night there were student celebrations there even in March. Administratively, Paceville is a district of the city of St Julian's, although the boundaries between the cities in Malta are often difficult to trace.

Coast at St Julian's. There is a small beach in Paceville. As far as I understand, the main beaches are located to the north.

Valletta, the capital of Malta, can be explored on foot in an hour.

<p>
But it's better to spend more time looking at door handles...

And other signs.

<p>
By comparison, the plaque from St. Julian's is also beautiful.

<p>
Opposite Valletta on one side is the town of Sliema, consisting mainly of shops, and on the other there are three fortresses, each of which is considered a separate city.

If you leave the gates of Valletta, you will first see the walls...
<p/>

<p>
And then across the square is the city of Floriana.
<p/>

<p>
In Floriana I managed to find a shop where for a ridiculous amount of about 50 eurocents I bought an adapter from a European plug to an English one. The adapter was just a piece of plastic, without any electrical elements, but nevertheless it did its job perfectly.

<p>
In addition to sockets and left-hand traffic, recognizable telephone booths remain from the British.

<p>
If you take the bus a little further, you can get to the town of Paola.

<p>
There is a Megalithic temple here, included in the World Heritage List. As a non-expert in prehistoric ruins, I wasn’t too impressed by this place.

But here you can see that in Malta, not only Valletta is beautiful.
<p/>

<p>
Here doors can be seen in every city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257158419_3db0859fbc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And road signs.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256411801_3f88fa5bd2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And balconies.

<p>
The Maltese language is close to Arabic. It seems to me that Malta is what you get if you take some Arab city like <a href="../jordan">Amman</a> or <a href="../morocco1">Casablanca</a>, and make Europe there.

<h2>Mdina</h2>
<p>
In the depths of the island is the old capital of Malta with the name Mdina, which is well understood by anyone who has been to Arab countries.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257158584_df25c62eb7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Mdina is even smaller than Valletta, but there is practically no population, and there are not a lot of shops and restaurants, so the city looks a bit empty.
<p/>

<p>
But here, as in other places in Malta, it is very beautiful.

The sculptures in the corners are familiar from Valletta.
<p/>

<p>
From the fortress wall you can see Valletta on the horizon.

<p>
There are also unusual door handles everywhere in Mdina.

In souvenir shops you can buy something for every taste.

In Malta, houses are often not numbered, but called by names.

If you are in Mdina, under no circumstances leave after visiting the fortress! The city of Rabat begins opposite Mdina.

This city wins the "Most Beautiful City in Malta" award.

Nowhere else in the world are there such breathtaking lanterns.

And such gorgeous balconies?

And the crowns over the aisle?

My hard heart just melted. I want to come here again.
