<h1>Tanzania: Ngara</h1>
<i>17-18 July 2024</i>
<h2>Ngara</h2>
<p>
After crossing the border, I still had to get to the nearest Tanzanian city of Ngara. I hired a motorcycle taxi driver standing at the exit from the border checkpoint (there were no regular taxis). It's not that close - about 30 kilometers, and at night, with a backpack on a motorcycle, what could go wrong? In principle, everything went as planned, and I even managed to buy a SIM card at a gas station while the motorcycle taxi driver was filling up. In Ngara, I checked into the first hotel I came across (yes, there are many hotels in this wilderness).

The hotel looked so modest, and without hot water, but for $4 it was quite decent.

I was very tired, and since the previous evening I had eaten basically nothing except a couple of cookies (and the previous evening I was still in Ethiopia). Nevertheless, the undoubted success of my adventurous trip across Burundi gave me the strength to walk around Ngara at night in search of food. At first, I was in for a fiasco - there were no normal shops there, all the stalls had only a couple of types of cookies, well, and soda. Of course, I bought them, what else could I do. But then I came across this luxurious village club, from where cheerful music was playing.

And at the entrance, delicious meat was being fried.

I took a double portion, it cost $5, and I ate heartily.

In the morning, I went for a walk around the city.

The houses are simple, but tasteful.

The sleepy morning streets were mostly walked by children in bright blue school uniforms. There are a lot of children, as is usual in Africa.

After walking around the city, I hired a motorcycle taxi to get to the border with Rwanda. We drove for almost an hour, according to the map it seemed to me that there was a shorter road, but maybe it was bad. Although the one we were driving on was not good everywhere, part of it was a dirt road with bumps, which was pretty scary to ride a motorcycle at high speed, especially with a backpack (there is a completely paved road, but it is even longer). Along the way, I only took one photo of the landscape when the driver stopped to put on a second sweater (and I didn’t even have one, although it would not have hurt, it was not hot at all). But in general, the landscapes in those parts are very picturesque.

For another dollar, another motorcycle taxi driver took me to the post, which is located a little deeper into Rwanda. Right on the border is a river with a picturesque waterfall. I crossed the border without any problems, and by about 9 am I was in Rwanda.
