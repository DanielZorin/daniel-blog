<h1>Russia: Irkutsk, Listvyanka, Slyudyanka, Ulan-Ude, Kyakhta</h1>
<i>6-8, 12-13 January 2015</i>
<h2>Irkutsk</h2>
<p>
Siberian Paris and real <a href="../paris">Paris</a> are united only by the Eiffel Tower. Well, we can also argue that compared to any city within a 1000-kilometer radius, Irkutsk really looks like Paris.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257257105_65310a2150_o.jpg">
<p>
Actually, here it is - the Irkutsk Eiffel Tower.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256759636_c573edce72_o.jpg">
<p>
And there is Big Ben.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256962944_8b7d29d75b_o.jpg">
<p>
Irkutsk is really beautiful and in the center it is little spoiled by commieblocks.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257257220_10ebb2e2fb_o.jpg">
<p>
It is deservedly included among the historical cities of Russia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256962824_b3df79ac22_o.jpg">
<p>
Irkutsk is somewhat in the shadow because most tourists are in transit there on their way to Lake Baikal.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257257135_e043cdf072_o.jpg">
<p>
Not far from the center there is a fake quarter with wooden houses painted in different colors.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255484887_1169ab96f3_o.jpg">
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255484837_49953519e3_o.jpg">
<p>
Since quite a lot of people go to Baikal, including foreigners, there are a lot of hotels in Irkutsk, and of very decent quality. The best hotel on this trip ("Good Cat") was in Irkutsk.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257257300_029c8d7f26_o.jpg">
<p>
The airport is set up interestingly. The terminal for international flights is in the style of the 19th century.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256963114_439febb190_o.jpg">
<p>
And there is a quite decent terminal for domestic flights nearby. However, international flights in Irkutsk are mainly charters to Thailand, although there are also several regular destinations, for example, to Beijing and Ulaanbaatar.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256215356_628165945d_o.jpg">
<p>
There is an amazing place in the center of Irkutsk - there seem to be old houses all around, but here on the end of the house they wrote out the entire text of the Internationale.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256963019_ecdc7a00a2_o.jpg">
<p>
And next to it is a monument to Lenin.
<p/>

<p>
The cultural life in Irkutsk is thriving, as the city has many students and many tourists. There are fashionable coffee shops.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256414028_7050416ba7_o.jpg">
<p>
They put up fashionable sculptures.

There is a good sense of humor here.

So let's have a drink before leaving for Baikal!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256759731_9360d5ff84_o.jpg">
<h2>Lake Baikal</h2>
<p>
Here it is - Baikal. How much has merged in this sound for the Russian heart.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255639182_3c8d38cf4e_o.jpg">
<p>
If you ask any Russian what to see in Russia, Baikal will definitely be in the top three.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257115374_1560ea6d34_o.jpg">
<p>
An incredible thing happened on Baikal - I decided to try fish that I had not eaten since early childhood, and I liked it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257115449_4fe72908b6_o.jpg">
<p>
Omul costs 100 rubles (small, like in the previous photo). Grayling - from 150. These fish live only in Baikal (although there are close relatives in the Siberian rivers - Ob, Yenisei, etc.) and buying them in other places is problematic, although in Moscow they seem to be available in some expensive gourmet stores . Omul and grayling are not endangered, but not so many of them are caught, only enough in the regions neighboring Lake Baikal.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255639017_341976e302_o.jpg">
<p>
Back on Lake Baikal, for the first time, I simply poured a bottle of drinking water.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256567578_1663c3c549_o.jpg">
<p>
It is still better to visit Baikal in the summer, although in winter there are also a lot of people walking around Listvyanka, the closest to Irkutsk and therefore a popular place.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255638957_abfd9938c7_o.jpg">
<p>
There is a chic, tacky hotel in Listvyanka.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256567613_24fbf75004_o.jpg">
<p>
But overall this village looks something like this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257115504_6c595d7bc1_o.jpg">
<p>

<p/>

<p>
The next destination off the shore of Lake Baikal was the city of Slyudyanka, at the southernmost edge of the lake. I expected that it would be nice there, I could walk along the shore, then sit for a few hours in a cozy cafe waiting for the train to Ulan-Ude.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255731068_fdc9bc6b96_o.jpg">
<p>
The reality turned out to be very harsh. Slyudyanka is a shithole. It was naive to hope that there was a cafe there. The Baikal embankment consists of rickety blank fences.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255731188_7abff45c06_o.jpg">
<p>
Actually the shore, there is almost no lighting. Of course, no one is walking around, except for the creepy types who hang out near the 24-hour kiosk, the only establishment on the street.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256275359_b49f4835b6_o.jpg">
<p>
A twenty-minute walk along Slyudyanka was enough to retreat in horror to the station building.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255731143_27daf2e1f2_o.jpg">
<p>
At least there were soft chairs and a few stalls working there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254796182_17150b641f_o.jpg">
<p>
Visiting Slyudyanka absolutely shocked me. This is one of the largest and most accessible cities for tourists on the shores of Lake Baikal, the Trans-Siberian Railway passes through it! And there are even only a couple of hotels in the whole city. Slyudyanka could be a tourist mecca, but it is an analogue of any dilapidated abandoned city in central Russia. This is the coolest view of Baikal, which is spoiled by Slyudyanka in the foreground.
<p/>

<p>
In general, using the example of Lake Baikal, one can see a big difference in the approach to natural attractions in Russia and in other countries. All of our similar places are oriented 100% towards backpackers.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255731363_683687b05a_o.jpg">
<p>
On the one hand, this is good because nature seems to belong to everyone; in Russia almost everywhere you can walk through forests and mountains, while in many countries everything will be fenced.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256275514_f3a89b138f_o.jpg">
<p>
On the other hand, this a priori greatly reduces the number of people who can visit these places, because not everyone wants to sleep in a tent, and there is no time to go camping for many weeks (and a week is not enough to see everything interesting on Lake Baikal on a hike).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255638787_7492a47eed_o.jpg">
<p>
If Baikal were in the USA, there would be a road built along the shore of the lake with a bunch of gorgeous views, and there would be hotels every few kilometers, but we essentially only have housing in Listvyanka. And the Slyudyanka - Ulan-Ude road, although it runs along lake, is laid through the forest, something like this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254796287_347a921e69_o.jpg">
<p>
Baikal is only sometimes visible behind the trees.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254796427_bf3b48cf5e_o.jpg">
<p>
With all this, it is very good here, you definitely need to come here to get to know Russia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255526341_ffcb0fba5d_o.jpg">
<h2>Ulan-Ude</h2>
<p>
The main attraction of Ulan-Ude is the monument to Lenin. Usually Lenin stands at full height on the main square, and busts are placed in less significant places. But in Buryatia they erected a monument to Lenin’s severed head.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256718590_bb61e6e72f_o.jpg">
<p>
And not just a monument, but a monument as tall as a decent house.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256422934_f554e9aa4f_o.jpg">
<p>
Buryatia is one of the regions of Russia where Buddhism is widespread. Unlike <a href="../volgograd">Kalmykia</a>, where Buddhism was banned and temples were destroyed, in Buryatia in Soviet times it was even allowed to found a Buddhist monastery.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255876833_0a03856f73_o.jpg">
<p>
The monastery is not located in Ulan-Ude itself, but in the neighboring city of Ivolginsk.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256422594_365effcbcd_o.jpg">
<p>
In real life, the Ivolginsky datsan does not look as epic as in some photographs.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256718215_34a944b455_o.jpg">
<p>
But it’s still interesting to come here, because there are few places like this in Russia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256422554_4944571cd5_o.jpg">
<p>
In one of the datsans I found a prayer accompanied by strange throat singing.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256718495_927239b5e1_o.jpg">
<p>
Even on a weekday morning the monastery is not empty.
<p/>

<p/>

<p>
Buryat flavor can be found throughout the city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256718960_c16d850625_o.jpg">
<p>
Even the letters at the station.

<p>
By the way, about the food. Buryat cuisine has much in common with Mongolian cuisine. The most popular dish is buuz, similar to Georgian khinkali.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255877478_294f8fd168_o.jpg">

<p>
The main street looks like the street of a typical Russian city.
<p/>

<p>
Ulan-Ude was founded by the Cossacks and was originally called Verkhneudinsk.

<p>
Ulan-Ude is located among low mountains, if you find an open area, you will have a gorgeous view. Considering that Baikal is nearby, the city is definitely worth a visit.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256718145_86308b3a11_o.jpg">
<h2>Kyakhta</h2>
<p>
The city of Kyakhta is one of about 40 historical cities in Russia; of all the cities on the list, it is the most distant from Moscow. Why exactly Kyakhta was included in the list is a mystery to me, because there is nothing outstanding about it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256328646_365710bca3_o.jpg">
<p>
Literally a couple of old buildings and that's it. But this can be found in many cities. There is no integral historical center in Kyakhta.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255597787_a490237d0a_o.jpg">
<p>
This is a standard private housing in the hills.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255597807_2684397d40_o.jpg">
<p>
On Lenin Street there are periodically beautiful houses.

<p>
And once upon a time, Kyakhta was a very rich city, because all trade with China passed through it, in particular, all the tea for Europe was transported through Kyakhta.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256526118_20c2777d16_o.jpg">
<p>
There are three churches, one has been destroyed, and the Lenin monument looks appropriate against its background.

<p>
The third one is located exactly at the border with Mongolia, behind the church there is barbed wire.
<p/>

There is also a “yummy” stall in Kyakhta.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257075444_f299cc4fc1_o.jpg">
<p>
And nothing else special, well, except for the border with Mongolia, of course. The border with Mongolia cannot be crossed on foot, although the distance is short, and on both sides there are settlements, not an open field. You have to pay the hucksters 200 rubles for a seat in the car.
