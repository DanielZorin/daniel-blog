<i>1-3, 9-10 June 2017</i>
<h2>Khulna</h2>
<p>
The first stop on my journey through the provinces of Bangladesh was the city of Khulna - one of the eight provincial capitals.
<p/>

<p>
I traveled from Dhaka by an overnight train which arrived in Khulna around 5 am. I was traveling in the most expensive class - a compartment with air conditioning, the ticket cost as much as 20 dollars. Long-distance trains in Bangladesh are quite comfortable (which cannot be said about suburban trains), and they also run on time, unlike Indian ones.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256057286_04d485e140_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are compartments for four and two. Tickets can be purchased on the website and printed at the station ticket office.
<p/>

<p>
Before dawn I had to sit in a diner near the station.
<p/>

<p>
As soon as the sun rose, I went for a walk around the city. It was still too early, and besides the pedicabs near the station there was almost no one on the streets.
<p/>

Selling bananas at the station.

<p>
A shopping area where shops have not yet opened.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255540482_4017edcd3d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Typical Khulna. There are no attractions in the city. The region has two World Heritage Sites - the Bagerhat Mosque and the Sundarbans (mangrove forests). It is almost impossible to see the Sundarbans from Bangladesh; there are no excursions there; at most you can drive to the edge of the reserve and go to the zoo there. It is better to see this park from the other side of the border in India, where there is some kind of infrastructure. But it’s quite possible to go to Bagerhat, it’s only 20 kilometers from Khulna.
<p/>

<p>
A math tutor advertises himself. Since Bangladesh has one language throughout the country, there are fewer signs in English.
<p/>

<p>
Men push a cart with bricks by hand. Bangladesh is such a poor country that hiring two porters is still cheaper than getting a car to transport bricks.
<p/>

<p>
At the end of the main street there is a ferry terminal where you can cross to the other side of the river, from where buses go to Bagerhat.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257017904_f35a6e5b4b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The enchanting crossing costs 2 taka (around $0.02) and is packed to the brim with people. Yeah, they obviously don’t worry about safety standards here. I used it too, since there were no other options.
<p/>

<h2>Bagerhat</h2>
<p>
In the city of Bagerhat, several mosques and mausoleums from the 15th century have been preserved. They are not located in the modern city of Bagerhat, but along the highway to Khulna, you need to get off the bus early.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256060763_5b8fd041cb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The main building is a mosque with 60 domes. Entrance to the territory costs 2.5 dollars; the inside is closed, but you can look through the windows and doors.
<p/>

<p/>

<p>
The rest of the objects are still a couple of kilometers along the road to the south, you can walk. For a long time this city was abandoned, but now it’s a rural area, people are growing something in the fields.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256902230_4bf5eaf74e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are ponds overgrown with mud along the route.

<p>
On the road here there are sort of souvenir shops that mostly sell strange paintings and photographs.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256061003_f55bc09879_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a residential area nearby, all the houses here are fenced with fences made of sticks like this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255130352_1aaeca115e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the vicinity of the mausoleum there are several other small mosques operating.

It seems to me that this pavement is more than a decade old, maybe even a century old.

<h2>Jessore</h2>
<p>
From Khulna, I planned to go north, so I immediately jumped on a bus heading to Jessore, the neighboring regional capital.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256232681_20ec078fac_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Jessore is an ordinary city with a population of 200 thousand. The article about it in the English Wikipedia consists of 5 lines.
<p/>

<h2>Rajshahi</h2>
<p>
The second provincial capital on my route, compared to Khulna it is simply a metropolis - the entire center looks like a solid city.

They wanted to paint the Taj Mahal on this rickshaw, but it looks more like the mausoleum in Aurangabad.
<p/>

<h2>Puthia</h2>

This is perhaps the best preserved old city in Bangladesh.

<p>
It would be a typical four-footed Orthodox church if the domes were golden and not cone-shaped.

<h2>Natore</h2>
<p>
In the city of Natore you can visit the palace of local rulers from the 18th century. It's unexpected to see baroque in Bangladesh.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256537711_4f3d61d3ca_h.jpg"/>

<h2>Bogra</h2>
<p>
Bogra is a large city and transport hub, where I stayed overnight in a hotel. There is nothing special to see in the city, except for the unreal crowd on all the central streets.

There are so many people here that I couldn’t even eat in the restaurant right away - I had to come later when there were places at the tables.

<h2>Mahastan</h2>
<p>
Just north of Bogra are the ruins of the Mahastangarh fort, which is about 2000 years old. Now all that remains of it are the walls, which seem to have been well restored recently.
<p/>

You can walk around the fortress wall, after a while the restored part will end.

What’s good about Bangladesh is that even in such a seemingly rural area there is plenty of transport. You just stand next to the highway and after 5 minutes you get into a passing tuk-tuk, which will take you to the next village in 10-20 taka. The main thing is to wait for a tuk-tuk that still has room to fit into.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255705863_1b40499a12_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The next village to the north is called Shibganj. Administratively the fort is on its territory.
<p/>

<p>
In all Bangladeshi villages I aroused a lot of interest, people came up and looked from a distance of several meters to see who had come to them. Those who were more advanced in English asked what country I was from.
<p/>

<h2>Paharpur</h2>
<p>
The second World Heritage Site, the Paharpur Temple, was not easy to reach: it is deep in the countryside and some distance from the main roads.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256810883_5454232537_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The nearest town is called Joypurhat, I got there by bus from the village of Shibganj - it is at the turn off from the main highway leading north, and I easily found a bus there. From Joypurhat you need to go completely along a country road. On the central street of Joypurhat, the police took an interest in me, they fiddled with my passport for a long time, looking at visas and stamps, and in the end they put me on the right bus, although it seems to me that I missed a couple of also suitable buses while hanging out in their booth.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256810618_0a56a5870b_h.jpg"/>

<p/>

The bus on the country road was shaking terribly.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255881967_bee0b93854_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At one time this road even had a surface.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257357004_78df36b9e0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And it was covered with stone pavement, like on the roads of Ancient Rome. It looks like this road hasn't been improved in the last fifteen hundred years.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256610026_08b09f904d_h.jpg"/>

Only landfills appeared along the roadsides.

<p>
Finally, after another short rickshaw ride, I reached a huge Buddhist temple, one of the largest in South Asia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257356669_91870453e1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Immediately I got on Bangladeshi TV, reporters were filming something, and they asked me on camera a few questions about whether I liked this temple.
<p/>

Train schedule. It seems that most of them are suburban, because there are no tickets for them on the website, there are only a couple of elite trains to Dhaka.

<h2>Sonargaon</h2>
<p>
On the road from Dhaka to Chittagong in the city of Sonargaon there is an abandoned area called Panam Nagar. Once upon a time, rich Indian traders lived here and built luxurious villas for themselves, but after the declaration of independence of India and Pakistan and the exchange of populations, they were all expelled because they were not Muslims. By some miracle, the houses were not occupied by other people, like the palace in Natore, but were left empty, and now they have completely fenced them off and turned them into a museum.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255536426_d6993397fb_h.jpg"/>

The facades of the houses are already in poor condition, but once there was Baroque here.

<h2>Chittagong</h2>
<p>
Chittagong is the second largest city in Bangladesh. It is of interest mainly to journalists trying to get into the shipyards where old ships are dismantled. There's not much to see in the city. I ended up here for an unusual reason - the flight Chittagong - Dhaka - Kuala Lumpur with the national airline Biman was cheaper than just Dhaka - Kuala Lumpur.
