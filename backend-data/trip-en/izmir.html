<h1>Turkey: Antalya, Denizli, Pamukkale, Selçuk, Izmir, Çanakkale</h1>
<i>7-10 January 2022</i>
<h2>Antalya</h2>
<p>
Antalya is the city where charters with all-inclusive vacationers fly. But it is also one of the largest cities in Turkey, located in a very beautiful region.
<p/>

<p>
I arrived early in the morning. From the airport you can get to the city by tram.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51873650624_46de7bfe79_o.jpg">
<p>
The tram line is very long, running through the entire city (there is also a second line not in the center).
<p/>

<p>
The outskirts of the city look typical for Turkey.
<p/>

<p>
Residential areas are already close to the center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51873333001_c163ce7fe2_o.jpg">
<p>
But the historical center itself is very picturesque, around the harbor. Similar to the cities of <a href="../malta">Malta</a>.
<p/>

<p>
There are also mountains and beauty in the distance.

<h2>Denizli</h2>
<p>
Denizli is an ordinary city - a regional center, notable mainly for its proximity to Pamukkale. It seems that most tourists stay in Pamukkale itself (or come there on an excursion without an overnight stay), so life in Denizli itself goes on as usual.

Turkish low speed train. You can get to Izmir, much cheaper than a bus.

From the inside it looks about the same as a high-speed one. It even has sockets at every seat.

<h2>Pamukkale</h2>
<p>
Pamukkale is the place in Turkey where I most wanted to visit after Cappadocia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51873410778_5a74f87c7c_o.jpg">

<p>
From Denizli it takes half an hour by minibus. I arrived quite early, it was barely dawn. It turned out that the city of Pamukkale is just as touristy as Göreme, there are hotels all around, which is probably why there is no one in Denizli.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51873411178_42e386c1b6_o.jpg">
<p>
However, in January it was quite deserted here too.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51873336516_3f179de05f_o.jpg">
<p>
It turned out that they also fly hot air balloons here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51873654124_f221037337_o.jpg">
<p>
This is what Pamukkale looks like from below. This is a rock made of travertine (a mineral) along which water flows from hot springs located above.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51873411128_a6f3064458_o.jpg">
<p>
The water creates those round-shaped pools with terraces.

<p>
You must walk on travertine barefoot; you are asked to take off your shoes so that it remains white. And in winter it was not warm there at all, and the water that reached the bottom was already cold (although at the very top it was still hot). Therefore, it was not easy to climb and it was very cold.

Ephesus was home to one of the seven wonders of the ancient world - the Temple of Artemis of Ephesus. The one that was burned by Herostratus. While the ruins of Ephesus themselves are a few kilometers from modern Selchuk, the remains of the temple are here on the outskirts of the city in a field.

<h2>Ephesus</h2>
<p>
Ephesus is probably the most famous archaeological site in Turkey. Surprisingly, I explored it almost alone. Of course, it was winter, but in <a href="../rome">Italy</a> or <a href="../newgrange">Ireland</a> there was still someone, while here most of the time I was completely alone, only towards the end several people came towards me.
<p/>

<p>
I arrived from Selçuk by taxi, the taxi driver took me to the upper entrance, from where the main road descends into the main part of the city. By public transport you can go up to the lower entrance (but you need to walk another kilometer from the highway).
<p/>

<p>
Ephesus was a major city during the times of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. Then it stood on the seashore, which is now 5 kilometers away. When the sea left, the city began to empty due to the decline of trade, and was finally abandoned only in the 15th century.

<h2>Izmir</h2>
<p>
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey. Before the First World War, the population of the city was mainly Greek (and it was called Smyrna), and after the defeat of Turkey, Greece annexed the region, but in 1922 the Turks recaptured it, and the Greek population was killed or evicted. At the same time, there was a fire in the city that destroyed most of the historical center.

When you approach Izmir by train, you go around a high hill, on the top of which are the remains of an old fortress, and along the slopes are picturesque favelas.

There is a metro in Izmir, and I wanted to ride it a couple of stops to the central square. But it turned out to be not so simple - you cannot buy a ticket at a metro station. You can only top up your travel card, which I didn’t have, and it’s unclear where to buy it (you can’t do it at the station). I walked towards the center and stopped at two more stations along the way, but it was the same story.

The essence of the Battle of Gallipoli was that England and France wanted to land troops at the Dardanelles, capture Istanbul and take Turkey out of the First World War. Their force was landed, but could not advance anywhere, and was eventually evacuated with heavy losses. The ANZAC corps recruited in <a href="http://goo.gl/wZSUAW">Australia</a> and <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/tag/new%20zealand">New Zealand</a> were actively used in this operation, there are monuments in their honor on the peninsula and tourists from these countries come.

There is also a Trojan horse at the airport. Çanakkale airport is perhaps the smallest I've been to in terms of number of flights - there are only three flights a week from here to Ankara (too close to Istanbul, it's easier to get there by bus).

<h2>Troy</h2>
<p>
An important attraction of Çanakkale are the ruins of Troy - the city about the assault of which the Iliad was written. The ruins are located near the village of Tevfikiye, which is about 30 minutes by minibus. I was the only visitor that morning. There is a Trojan horse at the entrance.

For a long time it was believed that the Iliad was purely fiction, but in the 1860s this site was found to correspond well with the descriptions from the legends.

The city was destroyed several times, different layers on the diagrams are called numbers (Troy-1 - Troy-9). The most central fortified part is Troy-2.

Heinrich Schliemann, who found these ruins, considered this citadel to be the site of the Trojan War, but it was later discovered that it dates back to an even earlier era.

The Troy of the Iliad is Troy 7, destroyed around 1180 BC.

The Trojan War was followed by a period known as the "Dark Ages" or "Late Bronze Age Catastrophe" - a period of severe cultural and technological decline comparable to the Middle Ages.

The latest Troy existed already during the Roman Empire.

Panorama of the city, along this street was the main entrance. The city looks very small, literally like one block in modern times, it’s hard to believe that many people once lived there.

I also walked around the village of Tevfikiye, which is located about a kilometer from Troy.
