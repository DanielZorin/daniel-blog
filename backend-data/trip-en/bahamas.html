<h1>Bahamas: Nassau</h1>
<i>11-12 November 2021</i>
<h2>Nassau</h2>
<p>
Unfortunately, I didn’t manage to get to the Caribbean islands before the pandemic began (I was just about to go there in 2020), and then visiting them became problematic. But I still decided to go to one country that is almost impossible to fly into without a transfer in the USA (while I still have a visa). Actually, I thought about going on a cruise, but once again it turned out that cruises are useless. Not only does the search for cruises look as if I typed “sex porn xxx” into Google, it also turned out that all the short cruises go to the islands of Grand Bahama or Bimini, where there's nothing to see, and short cruises going to Nassau are very rare, a couple of times a month. And I didn’t see any point in paying 700  dollars for a five-day cruise where two days will be wasted at sea. So I just hopped on a plane from Miami to the Bahamas. Almost the entire population is concentrated on the capital island of New Providence.

The Bahamas is expensive - a bed in a hostel costs $50 (still cheaper than in <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/587280.html">Hawaii</a>), however, I was there alone. In the morning I woke up early and went to explore the city. Near Nassau there is Paradise island, where expensive hotels and golf courses are located. Tourists are either there or in hotels away from the city. The islands are connected by a high bridge from which you can see a panorama of Nassau.

Paradise island, overlooked by the Atlantis Hotel. The building is identical to the hotel of the same name in Dubai.

In the foreground there is a fake area with "colonial" architecture, like on other popular Caribbean islands.

I called it fake because no one lives there, the passage is locked at night.

<p>
There are sidewalks on this island (unlike most of Nassau).
<p/>

<p>
But of course it’s more for cars.

<p>
There is a beach on Paradise Island, it's just not easy to find access to it, because almost the entire coastline is built up with hotels. But they cannot fence off the beach itself, so if you find a passage, you can get in.

Price list in a restaurant. Prices in American dollars are similar to the USA - dishes from 20 dollars, and another 27% of taxes on top, so actually at least 30.

There are actually two bridges to the mainland, one to go there, the other to go back, for cars there is a toll.

There is a port in the middle of the mini-island, and ferries to other islands seem to go from there.

Under the bridge there is a row of Caribbean bars where you can grab a yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum. Local drunks hang out near them.
