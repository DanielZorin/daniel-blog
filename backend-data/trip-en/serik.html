<h1>Turkey: Serik</h1>
<i>28 December 2023</i>
<h2>Serik</h2>
<p>
On a beautiful December day, I visited several interesting places east of Antalya, around the city of Serik. To get there, you need to rent a car, as the journey will be partly along narrow mountain roads.

<p>
The first stop was near the ancient Roman city of Aspendos, 10 kilometers from Serik.

<p>
Aspendos is famous primarily for its theater. This is one of the largest and best preserved theaters in Turkey.

The scene is especially well preserved.

<p>
Concerts and performances are constantly held here, so the upper rows have been slightly renovated.

We accidentally drove into the town of Taşağıl, located at the turn towards the Tazi canyon.

There are two canyons - Köprülü and Tazi. They are actually on the same river, and next to each other, so I thought they were two names for the same place. But still these are two different observation platforms. First, Köprülü. It means "bridged canyon" because there is an ancient bridge here.

To reach the Tazi Canyon, drive another 15 kilometers along a winding road. A small lookout along the way.

These lookouts are reminiscent of the fjords of Norway.

In conclusion, let's take a little look at the city of Serik.
<p/>

<p>
It is one of two large cities between Antalya and Alanya (together with Manavgat). Although the Serik district includes the village of Belek with the most expensive hotels in the region, the city itself is completely non-touristy, probably the most non-touristy of all the coastal cities in the province of Antalya.
