<h1>Russia: Gorno-Altaysk, Chemal, Artybash, Srostki, Biysk, Barnaul</h1>
<i>13-17 August 2020</i>
<h2>Gorno-Altaysk</h2>
<p>
I wanted to visit Altai for a long time, but I put it off for two reasons: it’s expensive and inconvenient to get there, and it’s not clear how to get around. The first problem was resolved over time: air tickets across Russia are steadily becoming cheaper, and since 2019, Pobeda began flying directly to Gorno-Altaysk, the capital of the Altai Republic, which is more convenient than the more usual route through Barnaul, the capital of the neighboring Altai Krai, from which it is still almost 5 hours away by bus. The second problem remained. The vast majority of tourists in the region are either on a group tour or in their own car. You can come by your own car from Barnaul, well, maybe from <a href="../sakhalin">Novosibirsk</a> (450 km), but not from the western part of Russia, from which the journey will take 5 days. Car rental in Altai is in its infancy, and for me it was basically impossible due to the requirement of 5 (!) years of driving experience. I also rejected group tours, since they are tied to certain dates and have a too sparse program. I wouldn't mind buying day trips, as I have done in many countries from <a href="../">Ireland</a> to <a href="../">New Zealand</a>, but this approach does not work in Altai either: the only company I found has tours in each direction, at best, once a week, and not every day. There was only one thing left to do - board a plane and plunge headlong into the unknown, as when traveling through <a href="../sulawesi">outback Indonesia</a>.

Small airport of Gorno-Altaysk. Buses into the city go once an hour, so I took a taxi (Yandex works).

Gorno-Altaysk stretches out as a narrow strip in a valley between two chains of hills.

<p>
At the exit on the hill there are three names of the city: Ulalu (until 1932, this is also now the official name in the Altai language), Oirot-Tura (until 1948) and the modern one.

<p>
There has been no communism for 30 years, but the word “private” is still a dirty word, although in fact all official buses from the bus station are also private, owned by individual entrepreneurs and small LLCs. Of course, just under this poster the “private” carriers a.k.a. collective taxis are hanging out. You can go deeper into the republic, but only in the morning, and you will have to wait a long time. Much more taxi drivers go to Barnaul and Biysk, but there are also quite a few buses there.

<h2>Chemal</h2>
<p>
One main road passes through Altai - the Chuisky tract from Biysk to the border with Mongolia. The highest mountains are located closer to the border, but getting there is very difficult - many places have no roads, others can only be reached by SUV: you need to have a lot of time. The northern part of the region is relatively accessible, and most hotels and good roads are concentrated there. Basically, it’s all along the Katun River, parallel to which the Chuysky tract runs, and then the Chemalsky tract, which branches off from it. Buses and shared taxis go to Chemal several times a day.

At first glance, this is an ordinary village, however, if you look closely, on many fences there are notices for renting rooms, which is not typical for ordinary villages, although it is a common occurrence in tourist places like the Black Sea coast.

Suddenly, quite a lot of tourists materialized here, I still didn’t understand how they ended up here - visually there were much fewer cars in the parking lot than could accommodate all the people, I didn’t see any tourist buses, and besides me, the public buses were mostly used by local residents. Maybe the tour buses drop off passengers somewhere else.

<h2>Lake Teletskoye</h2>
<p>
Lake Teletskoye is one of the largest lakes in Russia and a UNESCO World Heritage Site (together with other protected areas of Altai). You can get here only once a day by bus, which arrives at the lake in the evening and leaves in the morning for Barnaul with a stop in Gorno-Altaisk, or by rare collective taxis only in the morning, or by taxi for 5k rubles. There is a road to the lake from only two edges: in the north-west there is the village of Artybash, and to the far south-eastern shore there is a road from the Chulyshman Valley. There are no roads along the shores; you can only move by water.
<p/>

<p>
True fans of Altai believe that Lake Teletskoye is a place for cattle and there are too many tourists there. This may seem so due to the fact that in the summer local hotels are well filled, especially on weekends, but there are not so many of them in total - I estimated the number of people on the lake at one time at one and a half to two thousand people, and later I checked that according to the official statistics there are about 1800 hotel beds in this entire area. For comparison, in the city of <a href="../nz-south">Queenstown</a> in New Zealand, which is similar to Artybash as it's located in the mountains on the shore of a similar lake, there are up to 50 thousand tourists every day, but for some reason this does not destroy nature in any way.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256011458_28e492ae27_o.jpg">
<p>
While Artybash has room to grow in terms of infrastructure, there are already hotels of various levels, but roads have not yet been built (after all, they are made by the state, not private owners).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256557439_562fb145ed_o.jpg">
<p>
The tourism industry is also at an early stage. In principle, there is already a lot of entertainment here, but you can only find out about it by asking the hotel owners, like in the good old days.
<p/>

<p>
It’s generally strange with food - judging by Yandex maps, in all of Artybash and Iogach there are no more than 4 restaurants, at least two of which are more like canteens or cafeterias at the store. I found only one restaurant - in the Artybash hotel, which fortunately was next to me, there is also at least one more restaurant, advertising for which I saw on the street (in the photo above), but it was far from me. The Artybash restaurant pleased me with both the food itself and the low prices - almost all dishes cost 200-350 rubles maximum.
<p/>

<p>
In the Sadko canteen, near which the buses stop, I ate for only 160 rubles. At the same time, this is not to say that the restaurants are full, rather the opposite. So it turns out that fifteen hundred people mostly cook their own food.

Now to the lake itself. There are two ways to see the lake. A slower way is the motor ship "Pioneer of Altai", which sails along the northern half of the island for 5-6 hours, twice a day on weekends, and once on weekdays.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255808011_3240f4705d_o.jpg">
<p>
A faster way is with speedboats, like this one. You can take a tour through the hotel. It costs about the same as “Pioneer of Altai” - I paid 1800 rubles, it takes about 4 hours. There is also the option of a longer excursion, including the southern part of the lake, for the whole day and for 3k rubles.

<h2>Barnaul</h2>
<p>
Barnaul is a meme city where people are imprisoned for memes, and the capital of the Altai Territory. 
<i>There is a meme comic strip with a dialogue: "Doctor, I am so worried about the leftists, BLM and political correctness in America" - "What's the deal with America? You live in Barnaul, Altai krai!"</i>
<i>In 2019 a girl from Barnaul was prosecuted for posting some memes about the church in social networks.</i>
<p/>

<p>
Barnaul is located on the banks of the Ob River, as is Novosibirsk.

There is nothing beyond the bridge except Leroy Merlin. In 20 kilometers there will be the neighboring industrial city of Novoaltaisk, but in general this is the main route to Novosibirsk.

The inscription "BARNAUL" stands on a high hill above the river, like in <a href="../los-angeles">Hollywood</a>, <a href="../romania">Brasov</a> and Keelung.

You can see many post-Soviet high-rise buildings of different shapes, especially to the left (this is not the center).
<p/>

<p>
The center stretches along the river and has almost no high-rise buildings. In the distance you can see the tall and long Barnaul grain storage.

The city center has an unusual format: in fact, it runs in a narrow strip along Lenin Avenue, stretching for as much as 5 kilometers. And literally one block from the avenue the residential areas begin. The only exception is closer to the mountain, where the center was located in the 19th century, and where few old buildings remain.

It is symbolic - the building on the right stands on Lenin Avenue, and the building on the left was built later on a parallel street.

Under Soviet rule, the city began to be built to the north along Lenin Avenue, first one main square was formed there, then a second one. There are pretentious bas-reliefs and “graffiti” on the houses along the street.

There is a house under a spire - a kind of symbol of Barnaul.

It's funny that in the 21st century the neighborhood decided to build another house under a spire, apparently to clearly show the degradation of architecture.

This factory area seems to have been thoroughly cleaned and part of it was converted into offices, but the sculptures of workers still stand at the entrance, although the passageway, which logically should be between them, has been removed.
