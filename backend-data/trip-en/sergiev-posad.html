<h2>Sergiev Posad</h2>
<p>
It’s surprising that living in Moscow, in 24 years I have never been to the Trinity-Sergius Lavra. Even when I started touring Russian regions, I kept putting off a one-day trip here, because it would be done in due time. And finally, it happened, this city of the Golden Ring was also conquered.

At the Lavra there was a huge queue for the relics and a smaller queue for water. A little later, the line for water cleared up.

In a small church next to the Lavra, you can watch live how the walls and dome are being painted. Hurry to see before they are finished!
