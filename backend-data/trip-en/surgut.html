<h1>Russia: Surgut, Noyabrsk</h1>
<i>7-8 November 2019</i>
<h2>Surgut</h2>
<p>
The city of oil workers, Surgut, is probably not the most popular place for a weekend trip, but Pobeda flies there cheaply, and I have already visited almost all of the nearby cities. Surgut is not the capital of the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug (a.k.a. Yugra), but it is the largest city, there is also a railway here, and to the regional center you need to travel 5 hours by bus.

I love snowy winters and hate rainy ones, as usually happens in Moscow. So it was great to cool off at -16 degrees.

<p>
Surgut is located on the banks of the Ob River (as is <a href="../vladivostok">Novosibirsk</a>)

<p>
The river is not frozen, and carries huge ice floes downstream, which, crashing into the shore, lose their edges with a characteristic crack sound.

<p>
As a result, piles of broken ice are formed. The spectacle is fascinating.

<p>
In the center of Surgut there is a small open-air museum where old wooden houses and a church are collected.

<p>
Walking around the city, I also discovered a non-museum old area with two-story buildings, which are now usually called “barracks”.

<p>
The snow is not removed from yards and small streets; there is a thick layer of icy slush on the road.

It seems that you won’t be able to drive a car without studs here.

Buses in Surgut are terrible, completely inappropriate for such a rich city.

<p>
Somewhere on the outskirts there is an area called Moscow.

Well, the main attraction of Surgut is the foreign language school, built in the form of a parody of the British Parliament.

<h2>Noyabrsk</h2>
<p>
I visited the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug a bit cheatingly: Noyabrsk, one of the two largest cities in the region, is located in the very south right on the border with Yugra and is easily accessible by rail. Along the way there are endless snow-covered forests of Western Siberia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255849777_59447e97f5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
If you ride from Surgut all night, you can get to the final passenger station Novy Urengoy - this is the largest city in the region, the capital of gas production. The capital of the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, Salekhard, is half the size of Novy Urengoy and Noyabrsk, but is also accessible by rail through Komi, although the ride is very long. Pobeda does not fly to any city in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug.
<p/>

<p>
There are two stations in Noyabrsk, Noyabrsk-2 in the city center and Noyabrsk-1 far on the southern outskirts. The train stops at Noyabrsk-1 for so long that it is often easier to get off there and take a minibus to the center.

<p>
Frankly speaking, there are few attractions in Noyabrsk. Almost the whole city looks like this.

<p>
Apparently, due to the cold climate, the houses here have a high foundation - the first floor is higher than usual.

<p>
There is an advertisement for real estate in Moscow on the building - probably because many people in Noyabrsk work seasonally and live in Moscow.

The main street. It’s not very noticeable now, but in summer it’s a wide green boulevard.
