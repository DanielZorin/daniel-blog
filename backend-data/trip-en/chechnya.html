<h1>Russia: Grozny, Argun, Shali, Khasavyurt, Makhachkala, Derbent</h1>
<i>25-28 April 2014</i>
<h2>Chechnya</h2>
<p>
One of the most important purposes of traveling to places like Central Asia and the Caucasus is to get rid of stereotypes. Russia is an isolated and poor country; most people have not been not only abroad, but outside their region. I think I won’t be mistaken if I say that no more than 5% of Russians have been outside the CIS, not at a closed resort or on an organized tour. The overwhelming majority live by stereotypes, and according to them, a trip to places like Chechnya and Dagestan does not promise anything good, because bearded terrorists live there and chaos reigns.

Such posters that hang in Grozny will make any Moscow resident laugh out loud.

<p>
Only people stuck in the 90s can say that Chechnya is dangerous. Those who follow the news even a little know that Chechnya is the calmest region in Russia with a very low crime rate. The hero of Russia, Ramzan Kadyrov, firmly holds power in the region.
<p/>

<p>
In terms of attitudes towards power, Chechnya can easily be called part of the Middle East. People here love their ruler and are not shy about hanging his portraits on the walls.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256345233_ec05de03ff_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I note that in <a href="../tajikistan">Tajikistan</a> the cult of personality is much wider. There are not very many portraits of Kadyrov at all, just like portraits of Putin. The most frequently encountered portraits are of Akhmad Kadyrov, the first president of post-war Chechnya.

Museums are named in his honor.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256344918_67db6b2675_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And museums open.
<p/>

<p>
The main streets are called.

At the entrance to all major cities there are arches with portraits of fathers.

<p>
Where there are no administrative buildings, Chechnya is visually similar to Russia and the rest of Asia.
<p/>

<p>
Classic jokes.

<p>
Chechnya is a Muslim republic, and not like Turkey, but like more conservative places. Alcohol is not sold in stores, and women wear headscarves; de facto, polygamy is even possible. Everywhere has its own standards of behavior. For example, in Spain it is normal to sunbathe topless on the beach, but in Russia or the USA this will cause shock to others. Walking in Grozny as if you were walking around a Moscow nightclub is not worth it out of respect. At the same time, guests are not generally required to observe all local traditions; no one will frown upon wearing jeans instead of a skirt. You can run a business: for example, we were in a cafe that was opened by a girl from Rostov who arrived in Grozny just a couple of months ago.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256145681_742ca2d737_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Probably the most hospitable people in Russia live in this part of the Caucasus. Hitchhiking in Chechnya is exceptional (and the roads are the best in the country).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255416587_0e5c160978_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The Russians are offended by the Chechens for endless wars, although it would seem that the Chechens did not conquer anyone; on the contrary, the Russians decided to annex the Caucasus to their country, guided by some “strategic considerations” and messianic delusions about their exclusivity.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255416632_1df7cfcd58_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Another stereotype is that nothing is produced in the Caucasus. In fact, if you walk through a grocery supermarket, you can see many goods produced in Chechnya. Meat, for example, is much cheaper in Chechnya than in Moscow: less than 200 rubles per kilogram.
But they don’t really like the local cuisine: everyone was very surprised when we ordered Vainakh dishes in restaurants; locals rarely eat them. Chechen dishes are very fatty and filling. The two of us ate our fill on this plate.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256894069_a08a3cb9d7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And of course, they make excellent kebabs in the Caucasus! The best one is prepared in the city of Khasavyurt, in Dagestan near the border with Chechnya. The cafe is located at the exit from the city towards Makhachkala. Take the mutton pistols, you won't regret it.

Grozny was significantly destroyed during the war, although some things still remain. You can see these neighborhoods if you stand on Putin Avenue and look towards the main mosque and turn left.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256893969_940c353911_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It looks something like this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257188935_3ca2e212f0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are also undeveloped areas.
<p/>

<p>
The new buildings look something like this.

If you compare Grozny with <a href="../dubai">Dubai</a>, you can find a lot in common.
<p/>

Light show. I recommend taking a walk around Grozny at night.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256893414_bac714bb35_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Due to the large spaces in the center, it seems that there are few people, although in reality there are many more than in Dubai.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257188495_bd1bcdd0be_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Plus, people here prefer to drive cars, since the roads allow it.

It seems that Putin and Kadyrov Sr. are now in the center.

I wanted to see not only the capital, so I boarded the first minibus at the bus station, which went to the regional center called Shali.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256239174_f98c6aef89_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On the square in front of the administration there is a model of the family tower.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256535420_cf1042b496_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Shali doesn't look as pretentious as Grozny.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256535460_372bc1f45e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You can even find broken tiles here if you look.

It's funny, Internet cafes used to be identified by the Internet Explorer icon, but now they are identified by the Chrome icon.

Goodbye, Grozny! One of the cities in Russia where it would be nice to live.

<h2>Makhachkala</h2>
<p>
Artemy Lebedev argued that Dagestan is not Russia, and tourists here will be looked at with suspicion. My experience does not confirm this. Yes, Dagestan is not quite Russia, but the attitude of the local residents is as welcoming as in other regions of the Caucasus. Compared to Chechnya, there is more of an oriental flavor here, which is expressed in a shabby appearance and illegal construction, collective taxis as transport and police officers patrolling the streets with a machine gun at the ready. When you enter Dagestan from Chechnya across the bridge in Khasavyurt, children from Uzbekistan are dancing lezginka, collecting alms.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255674567_a83bb900e1_h.jpg"/>

<p>
The capital of Dagestan greets you with very typical views on the outskirts.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256602338_b121192abb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The city is located on the shores of the Caspian Sea, but the coast in the city center is occupied by a railway and some industrial zones.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257150599_2b8339913f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There seems to be a beach outside the city.

More than 30 peoples live in Dagestan, so the cult of personality of local rulers does not take root. Only portraits of Putin hang.

<p>
If not for its bad reputation, Makhachkala could be a very attractive place by Russian standards.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257150974_2c5803c014_h.jpg"/>

Mountains begin above the city.

<p>
It's just outside the city. Here patrolmen with machine guns allowed me to photograph the landscape, but not them.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255674982_0b43eb001c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Although Makhachkala at first glance seems like a Soviet city, once you walk through the courtyards, it immediately becomes clear that this is already the east.
<p/>

<p>
The culture of graffiti has not yet reached Makhachkala, spray cans are not popular here, so everyone writes on the walls with chalk or felt-tip pens. It looks as if the writing on the school board hasn't been erased for a long time.

<h2>Derbent</h2>
<p>
The city is lost in time. Even fully confirmed 2500 years of history (and Derbent claims to be 5000 years old) make it head and shoulders above any of the Russian cities. The gate has been here for a couple of thousand years, cars drive through it, and there are modern houses nearby.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255326002_4fd21130f6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
These streets have clearly been rebuilt many times, but they still look as if they have been here for a thousand years.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257099345_3b1fca6757_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The streets have recently been paved. This is a residential area a little away from the center, behind a large wall.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255326307_012868d2d6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
What can we say about the wall, there are outlying residential areas with Khrushchev-era buildings with their own atmosphere.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257100075_70cec7be17_h.jpg"/>

Only in Derbent: Lenin against the backdrop of an Armenian church and an eastern castle (in <a href="../uzbekistan">Bukhara</a> there is no Lenin).

Derbent is the only city in Russia where you can find a traditional Islamic alms box on the street (if anyone doesn’t know, one of the “five pillars of Islam” is the duty of a believer to help the poor).
