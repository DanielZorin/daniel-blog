<h1>Russia: Grozny, Argun, Shali, Khasavyurt, Makhachkala, Derbent</h1>
<i>25-28 April 2014</i>
<h2>Chechnya</h2>
<p>
One of the most important purposes of traveling to places like Central Asia and the Caucasus is to get rid of stereotypes. Russia is an isolated and poor country; most people have not been not only abroad, but outside their region. I think I won’t be mistaken if I say that no more than 5% of Russians have been outside the CIS, not at a closed resort or on an organized tour. The overwhelming majority live by stereotypes, and according to them, a trip to places like Chechnya and Dagestan does not promise anything good, because bearded terrorists live there and chaos reigns.

Such posters that hang in Grozny will make any Moscow resident laugh out loud.

<p>
Only people stuck in the 90s can say that Chechnya is dangerous. Those who follow the news even a little know that Chechnya is the calmest region in Russia with a very low crime rate. The hero of Russia, Ramzan Kadyrov, firmly holds power in the region.
<p/>

<p>
In terms of attitudes towards power, Chechnya can easily be called part of the Middle East. People here love their ruler and are not shy about hanging his portraits on the walls.
<p/>

<p>
I note that in <a href="../tajikistan">Tajikistan</a> the cult of personality is much wider. There are not very many portraits of Kadyrov at all, just like portraits of Putin. The most frequently encountered portraits are of Akhmad Kadyrov, the first president of post-war Chechnya.

Where there are no administrative buildings, Chechnya is visually similar to Russia and the rest of Asia.

<p>
Chechnya is a Muslim republic, and not like Turkey, but like more conservative places. Alcohol is not sold in stores, and women wear headscarves; de facto, polygamy is even possible. Everywhere has its own standards of behavior. For example, in Spain it is normal to sunbathe topless on the beach, but in Russia or the USA this will cause shock to others. Walking in Grozny as if you were walking around a Moscow nightclub is not worth it out of respect. At the same time, guests are not generally required to observe all local traditions; no one will frown upon wearing jeans instead of a skirt. You can run a business: for example, we were in a cafe that was opened by a girl from Rostov who arrived in Grozny just a couple of months ago.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256145681_de99599f24_o.jpg">
<p>
Probably the most hospitable people in Russia live in this part of the Caucasus. Hitchhiking in Chechnya is exceptional (and the roads are the best in the country).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255416587_f5d0d7d911_o.jpg">
<p>
The Russians are offended by the Chechens for endless wars, although it would seem that the Chechens did not conquer anyone; on the contrary, the Russians decided to annex the Caucasus to their country, guided by some “strategic considerations” and messianic delusions about their exclusivity.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255416632_078ba64659_o.jpg">
<p>
Another stereotype is that nothing is produced in the Caucasus. In fact, if you walk through a grocery supermarket, you can see many goods produced in Chechnya. Meat, for example, is much cheaper in Chechnya than in Moscow: less than 200 rubles per kilogram.
But they don’t really like the local cuisine: everyone was very surprised when we ordered Vainakh dishes in restaurants; locals rarely eat them. Chechen dishes are very fatty and filling. The two of us ate our fill on this plate.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256894069_1d5d90ec17_o.jpg">
<p>
And of course, they make excellent kebabs in the Caucasus! The best one is prepared in the city of Khasavyurt, in Dagestan near the border with Chechnya. The cafe is located at the exit from the city towards Makhachkala. Take the mutton pistols, you won't regret it.

Grozny was significantly destroyed during the war, although some things still remain. You can see these neighborhoods if you stand on Putin Avenue and look towards the main mosque and turn left.

Due to the large spaces in the center, it seems that there are few people, although in reality there are many more than in Dubai.

<h2>Makhachkala</h2>
<p>
Artemy Lebedev argued that Dagestan is not Russia, and tourists here will be looked at with suspicion. My experience does not confirm this. Yes, Dagestan is not quite Russia, but the attitude of the local residents is as welcoming as in other regions of the Caucasus. Compared to Chechnya, there is more of an oriental flavor here, which is expressed in a shabby appearance and illegal construction, collective taxis as transport and police officers patrolling the streets with a machine gun at the ready. When you enter Dagestan from Chechnya across the bridge in Khasavyurt, children from Uzbekistan are dancing lezginka, collecting alms.
<p/>

<h2>Derbent</h2>
<p>
The city is lost in time. Even fully confirmed 2500 years of history (and Derbent claims to be 5000 years old) make it head and shoulders above any of the Russian cities. The gate has been here for a couple of thousand years, cars drive through it, and there are modern houses nearby.
