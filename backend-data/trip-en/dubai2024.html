<h1>UAE: Dubai</h1>
<i>8-9 July 2024</i>
<h2>Dubai</h2>
<p>
The big trip to Africa began with a transfer in Dubai. More precisely, I flew to Sharjah and flew out the next day from Dubai. The flight from Tbilisi was delayed for about three hours, so by the time I got to the center of Dubai (it's close, but there is no direct bus, you need to go with a transfer at the Sharjah bus station), it was already dark.

Of course, I stayed in Deira, where it is cheap and close to the airport. The hotel cost less than $30, gorgeous.

In Deira, they still throw business cards around the streets.

It's nice to walk in the evening.

Hairdresser. A haircut in Dubai costs only 3 dollars, you won't find it that cheap in Turkey.

It's not even 6am yet, and the Dubai metro is already packed with people.

I thought that I would get to the airport easily by metro, but it turned out that the metro goes only in terminals 1 and 3. And I was flying out of terminal 2, this is a terminal for low-cost airlines, quite small and cramped. And you can only get there by bus. However, I did not understand where the bus stop is near this interchange.

In the end, I just walked 20 minutes from the nearest metro stop.

Flying to Somalia, this is hardcore! The Somalis who fly with me are stylish.
