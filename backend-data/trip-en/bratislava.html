<h1>Slovakia: Bratislava</h1>

<h2>Bratislava</h2>
<p>
What is the difference between Czechia and Slovakia? In the Czech Republic, the person at the pedestrian crossing sign wears a jacket and hat, and in Slovakia, sweatpants and a cap.

This is all, of course, not in the historical center, but on the way to it from the station. Everything is fine in the center.

The cry of the soul on the way to the hill. By the way, I was actually wearing a suit at that moment.

A view of the city from above, I’ve already seen this somewhere: red roofs, a spire, and so on.

But here is a completely different view of the city, the opposite bank of the Danube, with residential areas. I still had some time left and free travel on public transport, so I took the first bus across the bridge for a few stops.

On buses there is a request to remove backpacks from your shoulders.

After wandering among the blocks, I came to the conclusion that this place is similar to decent residential areas of Moscow, not even necessarily with new buildings. For example, Medvedkovo now looks about the same.

Some houses are still gray commercial blocks.

But local authorities are fighting this with bright colors. Bratislava left a rather positive impression; it is clear that the city is changing for the better.
