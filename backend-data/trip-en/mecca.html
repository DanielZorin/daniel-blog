<h1>Saudi Arabia: Jeddah, Mecca, Tabuk, Al-Ula, Medina</h1>
<i>7-13 December 2022</i>
<h2>Jeddah</h2>
<p>
Jeddah is the second largest city in Saudi Arabia and the main port. Since ancient times, many trade routes passed here, as well as the Hajj route, since the holy city of Mecca is only an hour's drive from Jeddah. Jeddah is a rare city in Saudi Arabia that has preserved its historical architecture, for which it was included in the World Heritage List.

The airport is very large, and during the Hajj an additional terminal is opened no smaller than the main one.

<p>
As in other tourist places in Saudi Arabia, everything here is being urgently remodeled and reorganized. The central part of the city is partially and unpredictably closed to entry, so you have to get out of the taxi earlier.

The old city of Jeddah is famous for its buildings with carved wooden balconies. This entire old part is now uninhabited (at least in appearance), only tourists, workers, and those who take shortcuts go there.

The condition of old houses is really very sad, the materials are not very durable, and restoration is needed.

To the south of the old town is a more modern shopping area with clothing, jewelry, and souvenir shops. There is also a bus station there, and buses with pilgrims to Mecca often park in the same area, so it’s easy to buy souvenirs with the image of the Kaaba.

As a souvenir, I bought myself the typical clothes that many men wear in Saudi Arabia. Red and white scarves are a local feature; in the UAE and Qatar they are usually white.

On the edge of the old town there is a cemetery where there once was a crypt called "Eve's Tomb". Eve, the one who is the first woman on earth according to the Bible. But at the beginning of the 20th century, the Wahhabis destroyed it, and now everything there is concreted and photography is prohibited.

<h2>Mecca</h2>
<p>
Mecca is the main place of pilgrimage for Muslims. The Hajj can only be performed during one specific period of the year, and at this time, to enter Mecca you need a special visa, which is issued according to limited quotas, since there are more applicants than there are places in the mosque. The rest of the time, entry into Mecca is free, and many make the small pilgrimage called Umrah. It is much easier than the Hajj as everything can be completed in one day. First, you need to tune in and enter the state of “ihram” - this is, first of all, purity of thoughts, but there are also external rules - many things are prohibited (for example, smoking, shaving, killing animals, working). Men need special clothing, which is also called ihram - it should not have seams, so two pieces of white fabric are used: one is wrapped like a skirt, and the second is draped over the shoulders. You must enter ihram no later than a special place called miqat. Depending on which direction you arrive in Mecca from, it is marked on the roads, and it is not that close - Jeddah is already inside the miqat, so on planes flying to Jeddah you can often see men in ihram - they change clothes in advance so as not to do it on the plane.
Then the road goes to the Al-Haram mosque, and in Mecca all roads lead there - the city is built in rings around the mosque.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52582037878_223461e9c9_o.jpg">

<p>
It’s not so easy to figure it out - the mosque, and most of the area around it, is being actively rebuilt to accommodate even more people, there are fences everywhere. There are different entrances, some lead to the first floor - this is for those who want to perform Umrah; others lead to the second floor for those who just came to pray.

<p/>

<p>
And here it is - the Venerable Kaaba!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52582037808_7c8d44ec49_o.jpg">
<p>
The place is mesmerizing and a little surreal, considering the skyscrapers around.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52581521976_cff0bb466b_o.jpg">
<p>
You need to walk around the Kaaba seven times counterclockwise (this is called tawaf). In theory, you need to tie the upper part of the ihram so as to open the right shoulder, but I noticed that not everyone does this. On each circle, you need to greet the Black Stone, which is built into the corner of the Kaaba, with your open right hand.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52581522056_8ab3716fb8_o.jpg">
<p>
It is difficult to get closer, the flow is very dense. As far as I saw, at that moment it was impossible to approach the Black Stone at all, it was fenced off, but you could approach the door of the Kaaba if you pushed your way through (this can be done after the seventh circle, but not necessarily).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52581956720_109b65c8c9_o.jpg">
<p>
Opposite the wall with the door there is a small dome of Makam Ibrahim - this is the place where the prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) stood when the Kaaba was built. After seven circles, you need to perform a standard prayer (two rak'ahs), ideally in front of this place, but it can be a little further away, where it is not so crowded.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52581784634_f358001d18_o.jpg">
<p>
Next you need to drink water from the Zamzam well, it’s everywhere here in barrels like these.
<p/>

<p>
And you can move on to the next stage - sai. These are seven circles between the Safa and Marwah hills. Now these stone hills are completely inside the Al-Haram Mosque. This is Safa.
<p/>

<p/>

You need to run through a small area, which is indicated by green lights on the ceiling.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52581522281_5a43ee587d_o.jpg">
<p>
Almost all. You can take a break and look at the Kaaba from the second floor. All that remains is to shave, after which Umrah is complete. I’ve seen some people shave right in the mosque with a clipper over a trash can, but you don’t have to act so radically.
<p/>

Opposite the Al-Haram Mosque, the Abraj al-Bayt Tower was built in 2012 - currently the third tallest building in the world. Previously, there was an Ottoman fort on the hill in its place, but it was destroyed along with the hill.

There is nothing here yet, a large hill, which theoretically you can even climb, a tunnel is built under it leading to the Mina region (where they live in tents during the Hajj).

I had some more time to explore the city outside of Al-Haram Mosque. First of all, I went to Mount Jabal al-Nur. At the top of this mountain in the Hira cave, the Prophet Muhammad received the first revelation from Allah through the angel Gabriel - now this is the 96th sura of the Koran.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52581956365_6d6153820b_o.jpg">

It is possible to climb to the top, but I clearly underestimated the difficulty; according to the map it seemed that it was not such a big mountain, but I had little strength.

Mina is a region east of the center. There is a tent camp here during the Hajj, in the Muzdalifah valley you need to collect stones, and then in Mina throw them at the pillars symbolizing the shaitan (devil). During the rest of the year these places are empty:

The Hijaz Railway, connecting Istanbul with Medina, passed through Tabuk. It was planned to continue onward to Mecca, but they did not have time before the First World War, and then the Ottoman Empire collapsed. The section from Damascus to Medina was completed in 1908. Several train stations have been preserved in Saudi Arabia - in Tabuk, Medina and Al-Ula.

<h2>Al-Ula</h2>
<p>
The city of Al-Ula is now being made one of the main centers of attraction for tourists in Saudi Arabia. The Hegra Tombs are nearby, a World Heritage Site, but besides them there are beautiful landscapes and canyons. Everything is organized quite strangely and inconveniently - you have to take excursions everywhere, even if you have your own/rental car.

I arrived in the evening and tried to find a hotel on the spot, but some of the hotels marked on the map were not there, and others had no availability. I had to book through booking.com. In the morning, leaving the hotel, I saw that the city, it turns out, was located between steep cliffs, much like in the western United States.

<h2>Medina</h2>
<p>
On the last day I got very sick, and because of this I couldn’t see the city of Medina properly, I’ll have to come here again sometime. In general, people usually come to Medina after Mecca, since the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) is buried here.

To the east of it there is a cemetery where many of the Prophet's relatives and other figures from the period of early Islam are buried, including the third caliph Uthman (the first and second are buried in the mosque itself, along with Muhammad). The cemetery looks like a field because all the tombstones are destroyed so that they are not worshiped (Hanbali philosophy condemns this).
