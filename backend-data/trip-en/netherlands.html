<h1>Netherlands: Rotterdam, Delft, The Hague, Leiden, Amsterdam</h1>
<i>30 June - 4 July 2012</i>
<h2>Rotterdam</h2>
<p>
After Belgium, the Netherlands look simply crystal clean.
<p/>

<p>
Not a single butt is lying around.
<p/>

<p>
Only sparse leaves.

Here the streets are washed with water cannons.

Even dog waste is only in bronze.

<p>
Rotterdam is a large modern port.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255379526_234fcf04f6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And also a city of modern art.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254647372_1ea3cfadbb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also Picasso.

<p>
And many others.

<p>
Trains in the Netherlands are painted yellow and blue. The train is the main mode of transport in the country; buses complement the trains, allowing access to all villages. It is possible to travel between cities by bus (there is even a very cheap bus ticket for the whole day), but this requires an unrealistic number of transfers, for example, Rotterdam-Amsterdam by direct train will take 40 minutes, by bus - about 8 transfers, several hours of travel. Tickets for trains are sold in vending machines that only accept coins (the locals don’t care, they have a travel card like the Moscow “Troika” for all types of transport); at the ticket office, tickets are a little more expensive.

<h2>Delft</h2>
<p>
Visitors to the city of Delft are greeted by a breathtaking bike rack.

<p>
There are so many bicycles that they are drowning in the canals.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256252158_db91ba3c4d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I can’t imagine how you can drive a car here without falling into the canals. And most importantly, why?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256051716_2a31e598ac_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The Netherlands is a very cozy country. If you can put a flower bed somewhere, the Dutch will do it.

<p>
Square in Delft. Pay attention to the typical reddish tiles that are used to pave everything in Delft, but in other cities they are used mainly for bicycle paths.
<p/>

<p>
Tiles with the word "earth" in different languages are stuck around the city.
<p/>

<p>
A machine that gives out city maps, like in <a href="../goteborg">Malmö</a>. But here you have to pull the lever.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256800109_2d8c4e6a97_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Contemporary art has not spared Delft either.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255322497_77d2a714ff_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Delft has the best signs.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257096005_0129ad32e2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Everyone probably really likes the word huis (house) that often appears in Dutch names. Until you find out that it sounds like "hoys".
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256800029_0616400435_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Well, that’s how it happens.
<p/>

<h2>The Hague</h2>
<p>
Holland is so small that here children's playgrounds are built on the roofs of one-story houses, and trees are planted in narrow passages.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254889362_0423dd47a4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Dutch cities are so serious that street cleaners only sweep rose petals from the sidewalk.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255618696_36fa7171b7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The Dutch are so romantic that they even decorate their bicycles with flowers.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255823798_812fe2b44f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Nothing surprising.
<p/>

<p>
The capital of the Netherlands is Amsterdam, but the government and royal palace are in The Hague.

The Hague Tribunal, where war criminals are tried, is also located here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255823933_776e7de4ea_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Next to the tribunal there is an interesting installation of stones brought from each country of the world.
<p/>

As in other cities of the Netherlands, the streets of The Hague are given over to exhibitions of conceptual sculptures.

This is what a device for transferring money from a credit card to a travel card looks like. It's in a regular supermarket.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255824058_9a32a8dba3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In The Hague, there is sometimes confusion with house numbers - letter indices are added.
<p/>

<h2>Leiden</h2>
<p>
Leiden is a city in the Rhine delta.
<p/>

Like any self-respecting Dutch city, Leiden has its own coat of arms on the urns.

It seems that this is a stylization of the monument to the Bremen musicians in Bremen?
<p/>

<p>
There is exactly the same bridge in <a href="../indonesia-1">Jakarta</a>, only rusty.

<p>
At the station. As in other countries where train tickets are checked not at the entrance, but during the journey, in the Netherlands you can get off at an intermediate station, walk around and catch a later train. This allows you to save money.
<p/>

<h2>Amsterdam</h2>
<p>
What is Amsterdam usually associated with? 1. Drugs 2. Gays 3. Prostitutes. Well, let's take a closer look at these three pillars.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256015668_f8c3933df9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are not only gay bookstores, but also gay movie stores.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255816956_291e03cfae_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This place is famous as the world's first sexually tolerant cafe.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256016138_cd845ae42d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Now that area can safely be called the main area for LGBT hangouts. It is located east of the red light district.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255084822_0c08710602_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At the same time, this is a small Amsterdam "Brussels".
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255814011_420dcac3ed_h.jpg"/>
<p>
From gays we smoothly flow to sex shops.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256857945_c5b47e0a8f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Excellent shop. They even invented a word - “condomerie”.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255816826_d2e5adf75d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And we smoothly move to the red light district.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256015803_e0480db617_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Strange place. 95% of people go there to gawk. At night, I even saw a tour group of Russian-speaking women of Balzac’s age and grandmothers who also decided to look at prostitutes. However, someone periodically sneaks inside the doors. And this despite the outrageous prices of 50  euros!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255813636_f229331fba_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In general, Amsterdam is a completely unsuitable place for sex tourism. In Thailand it is much cheaper, and if you don’t like Asian girls, you can go to Ukraine/Russia/Moldova and other countries of Eastern Europe, where most Amsterdam prostitutes come from.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256016043_cf10b12644_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In addition to slender young girls, there are also offers for gentlemen with other tastes: African women, plump women, older ladies, and so on.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256565179_9238c03e21_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Finally, about drugs, more precisely about psychotropic substances (drugs like heroin are illegal in the Netherlands, as elsewhere). The situation with them is complicated, as I understand it, the legal status is very complex, on the one hand, marijuana does not seem to be sold to just anyone, on the other hand, its use and cultivation for personal purposes is not prosecuted.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256561904_ac9b479ab4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The government has long been trying to close coffee shops to foreigners, which has already been done in the border areas, where “tourists” from Belgium and Germany came.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256561879_6b1cd2d21e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The most famous pop coffee shop, on the edge of the red light district.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255084572_d51538d720_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Cannabis seeds are completely legal and are sold at the famous Amsterdam flower market.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255084257_d42885bf64_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In general, the problem with Amsterdam is that most tourists come here to get drunk and smoke marijuana. I've seen places with crowds of tourists, but nowhere has the average age been as low as in Amsterdam. The main street is filled with crowds of schoolchildren from all over Europe. Prices for beds in hostels here are sky high. Because of all this, the beautiful city has such a dubious reputation as northern Ibiza.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255816606_925e27146a_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256856980_465c7f3548_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Typical "tourist".
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255816991_095407712a_c.jpg"/>
<p>
But what about the residents of Amsterdam themselves? They rarely go to coffee shops, because they can safely smoke at home. But you can run and ride bicycles in Vondelpark, where there are no stoned tourists.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255814031_966794604c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Or lie on the grass.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255814061_975a1be1b9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At night, the wheels of the bicycles are illuminated.
<p/>

<p>
How can you miss such beauty?

An insane preaching of Christian values was going on right on the station square of the city of sins.

Strange drinking fountain. In Russia there are these in every medium or small city, but they were originally made to pour water into buckets, and not to drink from a powerful stream.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255816551_e94dbafe68_h.jpg"/>
<p>
No spam.

<p>
Behind the station there is a bay through which a free ferry runs. If you take it, you end up in a quarter for the poor.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256860320_09f897ed9e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is social housing here, mostly Turks live.

But even here everyone rides a bicycle.
