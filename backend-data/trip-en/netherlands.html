<h1>Netherlands: Rotterdam, Delft, The Hague, Leiden, Amsterdam</h1>
<i>30 June - 4 July 2012</i>
<h2>Rotterdam</h2>
<p>
After Belgium, the Netherlands look simply crystal clean.

Rotterdam is a large modern port.
<p/>

And also a city of modern art.

Trains in the Netherlands are painted yellow and blue. The train is the main mode of transport in the country; buses complement the trains, allowing access to all villages. It is possible to travel between cities by bus (there is even a very cheap bus ticket for the whole day), but this requires an unrealistic number of transfers, for example, Rotterdam-Amsterdam by direct train will take 40 minutes, by bus - about 8 transfers, several hours of travel. Tickets for trains are sold in vending machines that only accept coins (the locals don’t care, they have a travel card like the Moscow “Troika” for all types of transport); at the ticket office, tickets are a little more expensive.

Visitors to the city of Delft are greeted by a breathtaking bike rack.

I can’t imagine how you can drive a car here without falling into the canals. And most importantly, why?

The Netherlands is a very cozy country. If you can put a flower bed somewhere, the Dutch will do it.

Everyone probably really likes the word huis (house) that often appears in Dutch names. Until you find out that it sounds like "hoys".

<h2>The Hague</h2>
<p>
Holland is so small that here children's playgrounds are built on the roofs of one-story houses, and trees are planted in narrow passages.

At the station. As in other countries where train tickets are checked not at the entrance, but during the journey, in the Netherlands you can get off at an intermediate station, walk around and catch a later train. This allows you to save money.

<h2>Amsterdam</h2>
<p>
What is Amsterdam usually associated with? 1. Drugs 2. Gays 3. Prostitutes. Well, let's take a closer look at these three pillars.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256015668_e65a37bedd_o.jpg">
<p>
There are not only gay bookstores, but also gay movie stores.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255816956_994e87c52f_o.jpg">

This place is famous as the world's first sexually tolerant cafe.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256016138_5ab1d3cb3f_o.jpg">
<p>
Now that area can safely be called the main area for LGBT hangouts. It is located east of the red light district.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255084822_3e00734c1d_o.jpg">
<p>
At the same time, this is a small Amsterdam "Brussels".

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255816826_29ea994e08_o.jpg">
<p>
And we smoothly move to the red light district.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256015803_fa8fdc0b02_o.jpg">
<p>
Strange place. 95% of people go there to gawk. At night, I even saw a tour group of Russian-speaking women of Balzac’s age and grandmothers who also decided to look at prostitutes. However, someone periodically sneaks inside the doors. And this despite the outrageous prices of 50  euros!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255813636_bde625a63a_o.jpg">
<p>
In general, Amsterdam is a completely unsuitable place for sex tourism. In Thailand it is much cheaper, and if you don’t like Asian girls, you can go to Ukraine/Russia/Moldova and other countries of Eastern Europe, where most Amsterdam prostitutes come from.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256016043_c8c9958eb1_o.jpg">
<p>
In addition to slender young girls, there are also offers for gentlemen with other tastes: African women, plump women, older ladies, and so on.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256565179_e0016fa8ac_o.jpg">
<p>
Finally, about drugs, more precisely about psychotropic substances (drugs like heroin are illegal in the Netherlands, as elsewhere). The situation with them is complicated, as I understand it, the legal status is very complex, on the one hand, marijuana does not seem to be sold to just anyone, on the other hand, its use and cultivation for personal purposes is not prosecuted.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256561904_657a2bba07_o.jpg">
<p>
The government has long been trying to close coffee shops to foreigners, which has already been done in the border areas, where “tourists” from Belgium and Germany came.

Cannabis seeds are completely legal and are sold at the famous Amsterdam flower market.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255084257_834a68a285_o.jpg">
<p>
In general, the problem with Amsterdam is that most tourists come here to get drunk and smoke marijuana. I've seen places with crowds of tourists, but nowhere has the average age been as low as in Amsterdam. The main street is filled with crowds of schoolchildren from all over Europe. Prices for beds in hostels here are sky high. Because of all this, the beautiful city has such a dubious reputation as northern Ibiza.
<p/>

Typical "tourist".
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255816991_b90f79cb57_o.jpg">
<p>
But what about the residents of Amsterdam themselves? They rarely go to coffee shops, because they can safely smoke at home. But you can run and ride bicycles in Vondelpark, where there are no stoned tourists.
