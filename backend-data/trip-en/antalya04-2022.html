<h1>Turkey: Antalya</h1>
<i>22-24 April 2022</i>
<h2>Antalya</h2>
<p>
In <a href="../izmir">January</a> I liked Antalya, and I thought it would be nice to explore this city in more detail. The time for this came a little earlier than I expected. It had already become warm, the first tourists appeared on the beaches.
<p/>

<p>
Antalya consists of five large districts, the smallest in area is the center (Muratpasa). Tourists and expats live mainly in two coastal areas: Konyaalti (in the west and southwest) and Aksu (in the east, but this area also has a large area inland, which I will talk about separately). Two more residential areas are located far from the sea (where the bus station is and even further). The road to Kemer passes through Konyaalti, past the Migros shopping center.

<p>
There is an amusement park opposite it.

<p>
And at the crossroads there is an epic monument to Ataturk.

<p>
An artifact of a bygone era is the inscription “stay at home” on a red traffic light.

<p>
There is also Antalya Aquarium nearby.
<p/>

<p>
The last time I visited the aquarium was in <a href="../kuala-lumpur">Kuala Lumpur</a>.

<p>
In many ways they are similar (in terms of the range of fish). In Kuala Lumpur it’s a little bigger, but the glass tunnel is longer here.

By the way, about Ataturk. I arrived in Antalya on April 23 - a national holiday in Turkey. This is the anniversary of the national assembly that began the struggle for Turkish independence under the leadership of Ataturk, as well as Children's Day. On this day, in addition to monuments, large posters with Ataturk are hung.
<p/>

<p>
Merchants sell flags and portraits of Ataturk. There is also an interesting tradition that on this day children replace employees of various government bodies, up to the president. We had this at school on Teacher's Day, and in Turkey it is nationwide.

The ruins of the ancient city closest to Antalya are Perga (or Perge), they are located in the Aksu area on the northeastern outskirts of the city behind the airport.
<p/>

You can conveniently get there by tram. They are building a mosque at the tram station, and the flag has already been hung.

<p>
Not far from the metro station there are five or six schools/colleges nearby, and each one has a monument to Ataturk, you can take a lot of photographs at once.

<p>
The main part of the city was surrounded by walls, which are clearly visible, even some of the towers remained.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52037125568_a973f3ae40_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In front of the walls are the ruins of the stadium.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52037125633_aac23c8109_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Apparently, it was assumed that during a siege the theater and stadium could be given to the attackers.

From the higher platform you can clearly see the entire city, the perimeter of the walls and the hill on the left - this is the unexcavated part.

If you take the tram one more stop to the final one, you can visit the Expo.
<p/>

<p>
This park was built for the 2016 Agricultural Expo. The scale is smaller than world fairs, but the concept is the same. And there is even a tower in the complex (this is an Expo tradition; the Eiffel Tower in Paris was also built for the exhibition).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52036036547_4c60c90679_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It is quite far from the city center, essentially in an open field, so after the exhibition it turned out to be half-abandoned.
