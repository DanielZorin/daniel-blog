<h1>Russia: Smolensk, Talashkino, Flyonovo, Roslavl, Bryansk</h1>
<i>24-25 August 2013</i>
<h2>Smolensk</h2>
<p>
Smolensk was unlucky with its location. In addition to the fact that the city became a battle arena during all the invasions of Russia from the west, the city is located at a fairly large distance from Moscow: it’s a five-hour drive, it’s too far for a day trip. In addition, Smolensk is located away from the main tourist routes. And the city is more than worthy of a visit.

<p>
The road to Smolensk is of good quality.
<p/>

<p>
So.
<p/>

<p>
There are many steles in honor of the battles in 1941-1945.

<p>
It turns out that Russia also has its own piece of the Dnieper, which I have already seen in Ukraine (<a href="../kyiv">Kyiv</a>) and Belarus ( <a href="../belarus">Mogilev</a>). The historical center of Smolensk, surrounded by walls, stands on the banks of the Dnieper. The uniqueness of Smolensk is that only here in Russia the fortress walls enclose a very significant residential part of the city, whereas usually kremlins are small and consist of churches and museums. It’s almost as if the walls of Kitay-Gorod were completely preserved in Moscow.

The newlyweds go out to take pictures against the backdrop of the fortress.

The main street.
<p/>

<p>
The street goes across the bridge. At the intersection, when we arrived, there was a hellish traffic jam and confusion, like in some Asian metropolis. In general, drivers in Smolensk are interesting; they also take off a couple of seconds before the green light turns on.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256276309_6674bb1bf1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are stands around the city showing the nearest attractions, and even with text in English. Just like in Europe!
<p/>

<p>
By the way, this church has miraculously stood here since the 12th century. Surviving the Mongol invasion is a rarity.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256276454_777cac744b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The walls were built at the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries. Not all are still standing, but many are.
<p/>

<p>
The most famous monument in Smolensk is to the heroes of 1812. I wondered for a long time what it symbolizes. In fact, there are two eagles here fighting off a French soldier with a sword together.
<p/>

Obelisk with monograms of different emperors from different sides.

Monument to children - prisoners of concentration camps.
<p/>

<p>
A monument to an interesting personality - Nikolai Krylenko, Minister of Justice of the USSR, one of the organizers of the mass executions of 1937, who himself was executed in 1938.
<p/>

<p>
In the center of Smolensk you can clearly see the difference in the level of culture in Russia in the first half of the 20th century...
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256571590_3c0ac6cf10_h.jpg"/>
<p>
...and in the second half of the 20th century. Both houses are practically on the main street.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255732293_f160a1311f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Smolensk further from the center.
<p/>

<p>
Homeland.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255527096_231004751d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The LDPR party and its slogans are still popular here. Moreover, the local governor is from the Liberal Democratic Party.
<p/>

Monumental Soviet building.

<p>
Restaurant "Prestige", opposite the hotel where I lived. In the evening, the entire elite of the area came here, the ladies almost in evening dresses, although inside there was an ordinary disco with Russian pop music.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255731918_96838d41d8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The quality of the road surface in some places leaves much to be desired.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254796772_49adc229bf_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Smolensk has been captured by the Kozinsky Greenhouse Plant - kiosks are at every turn.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256571795_aa6bf7c240_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Bus schedules here are lovingly written out by hand.

<p>
I wonder if there really are girls and women who want to *gain* weight?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255527376_b9854bc43f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Scam. You toss a coin, you get two. With probability <50%.
<p/>

<p>
Ramp in the underground passage. There is no such thing in Moscow yet.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256276639_5d57449be9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Smolensk residents are joking. The inscription in hieroglyphs is “kamikaze”.
<p/>

<h2>Flyonovo</h2>
<p>
I found out about Flenovo by accident - I saw a board with souvenir magnets in a bookstore, one of them depicted a church that does not exist in Smolensk. Getting here is easy; local buses run along the southbound highway to nearby villages. You need to get to the village of Talashkino.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256848744_e6a8342f04_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Talashkino, like any village, is very depressing, but in Talashkino they are unexpectedly polite, apparently, the presence of tourists is understandable to them and does not cause hatred, as in an ordinary village.
<p/>

<p>
The drunkard sleeps right in the rain. A couple of people stood nearby and loudly condemned him.
<p/>

<p>
The "Products" store and the main store in any village - "Funeral services".
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256848944_da916d65c0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
More than 100 years ago, they decided to turn Flenovo into a tourist village - a center of folk crafts. Now, due to the remoteness of Smolensk, there are not very many tourists here, but there are some excursions. We met a bus with the inscription La Valle for the fourth time: first it passed by when we were hitching on the highway, then we overtook it in one of the cars, and then we met it in the center of Smolensk.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257143615_4aff2602cc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Teremok itself.

<p>
What's worth coming here for is the church. Completely non-standard architecture, breaking all the patterns of Orthodoxy so much that they didn’t even want to consecrate it for a long time.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257784560_f023336180_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Roerich's paintings inside, apparently, have practically not survived. The doors are closed, through the crack you can see that inside there is a bare floor and bare walls. From the outside you can still look into the basement, where there is also nothing.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256300833_8b0053f341_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Roslavl</h2>
<p>
One of the most disgusting places I've ever been.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255375246_ee86aeeea0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There's nothing here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255375311_65bee8ccde_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a very big difference between medium-sized regional centers and such outlying cities.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255375336_c7e671f0e0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The people here are completely different - embittered, unfriendly. There are a lot of stereotypical gopniks with knocked out teeth, black eyes, and in tracksuits.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255375271_3bab7ae6b5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is no life here, no prospects. All reasonable people from here left long ago for Smolensk.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255578048_f0f9fb188b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I left here with great relief.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255578078_c80c1cb198_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The road sign at the exit seems to indicate the direction.
<p/>

<h2>Bryansk</h2>
<p>
If Bryansk stood by the sea, it could be called Russian Rio de Janeiro. But without the sea the picture is a little different, so it would be more correct to say that Bryansk is a piece of Belarus on Russian territory.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257010415_d17cbb82f8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Firstly, the cleanliness and neatness here are at their best, and secondly, the architecture here is quite new, since the Bryansk region was thoroughly destroyed in 1941-1944.
<p/>

<p>
A place for walking is Gagarin Boulevard.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256716159_8036221976_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The monument to Gagarin is very original. The circle depicts people who influenced the development of astronautics, from Tesla and Einstein...
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256716174_dff6bf0b3a_h.jpg"/>

<p>
The main attraction of Bryansk is the hills covered with greenery. This is what the panorama looks like in the center of the city.
<p/>

<p>
On the slopes there are villas mixed with apartment buildings.

<p>
And village houses.

<p>
Let's go down the hill.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256167883_859542fa33_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Just like the favelas in <a href="../rio-de-janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>.
<p/>

<p>
The stairs are falling apart, walk carefully.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256167978_f14c20432a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
All these street-paths have names, but it’s difficult to figure them out.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256168023_ae282b0121_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Somehow you can even get there by car.

Outskirts of the city, new residential areas.

<p>
In the center of Bryansk there is a clear shortage of cafes and restaurants; there are very few of them. So, whoever wants to start a business, go for it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4574/26588938339_35ffc8bee9_c.jpg"/>
<p>
But there is a store with a great name.
<p/>

<p>
Bryansk's main rival is neighboring Oryol.

<p>
I'll have to come here again.
