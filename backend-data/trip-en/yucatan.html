<h1>Mexico: Cancun, Chechen Itza, Valladolid, Merida, Monterrey, Nuevo Laredo</h1>
<i>20-23 November 2014</i>
<h2>Cancun</h2>
<p>
Cancun is a resort for American package tourists, like Sharm el-Sheikh, so hotel prices are much higher than average in Mexico. Since I arrived in Cancun late in the evening, I decided to stay in a hostel. The plane was also delayed, so I finally got there at about two in the morning. All the administrators were asleep, but fortunately the door was open, so I collapsed on the first available bed. Perhaps this hostel holds the record for the number of beds in one room.

<p>
Cancun is more polished than other cities in Mexico.

<p>
However, not everything is perfect in the city center. Only a few package travelers dare to go outside their hotel.
<p/>

<p>
The thing about Cancun is that the resort area is located on a long and narrow strip of land, with the sea on one side and a lake on the other. There is a road along this strip.
<p/>

<p>
There are big and angry crocodiles in the lake.

<p>
The weather was bad, so the idea of swimming in the Caribbean Sea was dropped. But you should at least look at it.
<p/>

<p>
Here is the beach closest to the city, where I walked in the rain.

<p>
And here is the main beach.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256742339_2b2aa1fed6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The water here is really an unusual light blue color.

The minimum goal in Cancun was thus completed.

<h2>Чичен-Ица</h2>
<p>
This is one of the new "seven wonders of the world". After everything I've seen in Mexico, it's not that impressive.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257062165_7571522820_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Half of the tourists take pictures near the pyramid and leave without even bothering to explore the rest of the archaeological zone.

<p>
The most distinctive feature of Chichen Itza is the incredible number of souvenir vendors.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256018371_cb83cf136c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In <a href="../jordan">Petra</a>, for example, there is only one souvenir shop, although it is full of donkey drivers.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255288417_eaea02f5fc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
By the way,if you speak Spanish, the price of souvenirs immediately drops by half.

<h2>Valladolid</h2>
<p>
Yucatan is easy to fly from Europe, but in terms of attractions, this region is very much inferior to central and northern Mexico. I would advise that even if you fly to Cancun, get on a plane after a couple of days and go to Mexico City or Guadalajara, otherwise you will miss 99% of the beauty.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254952007_39aea79f5a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On the day I was in Valladolid, there was a holiday in Mexico - the day of the Revolution. On this occasion, portraits of Villa, Zapata, Madero and other heroes were hung along the streets. I wanted to take photos of them the next morning, but they were quickly removed. Only in Russia New Year’s greetings hang for months. A rally was taking place in the central square, where a bored girl stood with a poster: “It is better to die standing than to live on your knees.”
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255681291_a39e59a3cb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Valladolid has its own sinkhole (cenote).
<p/>

<p>
Streets are simply named by numbers.

Interesting chairs for a rendezvous in a local park.

Otherwise everything is as usual.

<h2>Merida</h2>
<p>
Just a couple of months before, I had already been to the city of Merida, but in <a href="../badajoz">Spain</a>. Mexican Merida looks like a microcircuit from above.
<p/>

<p>
I checked into the luxurious hotel "Century II" opposite the bus station.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257532409_216c0e9520_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The room cost $9, the cheapest I've lived in Mexico. The room had a shower, which was larger than the room itself.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256057827_a6516ea1ec_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Only a few people get to Merida from Cancun. Compared to Cancun, there is, of course, more beautiful architecture here, but honestly only the main square is good.
<p/>

<p>
Then a market like this begins.

<p>
"Everything for 4 pesos" store.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255706377_845ea66fe1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
For a Mexican city, Merida is very monochromatic, with white predominating.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256435276_a8a0dfe7aa_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Tourists are transported on horse-drawn carriages.
<p/>

<p>
Street sign. Here, too, all the streets are numbered.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255706287_310a67f688_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Interestingly, the public toilet business is booming in Mexico. On the streets, you can see signs like this in large numbers, calling for you to visit the toilet for 5 pesos in this particular establishment.
<p/>

<h2>Monterrey</h2>
<p>
The third largest city in Mexico is not spoiled by the attention of tourists. I ended up here because it was much cheaper to get from Cancun to Texas by domestic Mexican low-cost airline to Monterrey, from there 3 hours to the border, then another three hours to San Antonio. At the same time, I stayed an extra night in a hotel in Mexico, saving some money on it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256647773_77bee154a0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Monterrey is called MONTErrey for a reason; the mountains are already visible as you approach. By the way, in America there is a fairly popular resort with a very similar name near San Francisco, called Monterey (with one “r”).
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255719102_fc60154e8a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a cool view from any more or less open area.
<p/>

<p>
Open spaces are great in Monterrey - they have the largest plaza in Mexico, the Macroplaza.

Central Street. Monterrey is a relatively young city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256447726_f7926cfeaf_h.jpg"/>
<p>
One chic-looking restaurant clearly stands out on this street, which at the same time faces a narrow alley.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257536124_3390df4c59_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I had 8 hungry days ahead in the USA on a diet from McDonald's, so I decided to finally go out to the restaurant, taking two servings at once to fill myself up. On the left is the Mexican "torta" burger, on the right is the regional dish "Tex-Mex". Lunch cost around $12.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257490420_0151b953f3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Monterrey has a small historical center, but no one walks there because all the restaurants and shops are in the block across the street.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256647628_adae425fad_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The main local feature is that all windows and doors are behind iron bars.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256647703_46128c66b2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The places here are not the calmest, the border is close, drug lords divide spheres of influence. In the state of Nuevo Leon there is nothing yet, but in neighboring Tamaulipas, which includes a part of the border, something terrible is going on. There was a famous massacre of more than 100 people when bandits hijacked buses full of illegal immigrants from Central America who wanted to cross into the United States without paying local authorities, and staged a “Hunger Games” (San Fernando Massacre) among the hostages.
<p/>

<p>
Monterrey has the third metro in Mexico, two lines. The fare is only 4 pesos, already for two trips the discount is 7 pesos. The ticket is in the form of a plastic card, and after use the turnstile takes it away, as in <a href="../guangdong">China</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256647418_5f7b7c2c6a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The station near the bus station looks ultra-modern.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256647393_5320ef5dee_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Some kind of celebration was being prepared in the city, and I observed rehearsals and preparations in several places.

<p>
The bus to Nuevo Laredo at the border was the best of all in Mexico: huge soft chairs, power sockets, internet. At the same time, I traveled completely free of charge. The fact is that the VivaAerobus airline has a special offer: when arriving at some airports, you can travel for free by bus to nearby cities by presenting your boarding pass at the ticket office at the bus station (you can also travel in the opposite direction, before departure). However, not all bus companies participate in this, so I had to wait until 9 pm, although buses to Laredo run quite often.
<p/>
<h2>Nuevo Laredo</h2>
<p>
Of all the cities in Mexico, only Nuevo Laredo gave me real concern. Somewhere I read very cool stories about the fact that there, almost like in the notorious Ciudad Juarez, drug lords fight and cut each other’s heads. I arrived after midnight, and the idea of walking for the first time did not seem so attractive to me that I took a taxi, which usually happens to me extremely rarely. In fact, it was possible not to take a taxi, but to stay in a hotel near the bus station, and take a bus to the border in the morning, but then I would not have walked around the city center. The administrator of the Two Laredos hotel, located right at the border crossing, charged as much as 25 dollars for a room. It was impossible to bargain at two in the morning, so I took the most expensive room in the entire Mexican trip. When I entered the room, I simply could not help but laugh heartily, after a long and difficult day.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256779318_d91cda4cec_h.jpg"/>
<p>
To be fair, although the room had not been renovated for a very long time, it had almost everything you needed: shower, hot water, toilet, sockets, comfortable beds. Only there was no Wi-fi.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257001803_0e134dd31c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The United States of America is visible from the window. I wonder who lives in this huge hotel on the other side? There the rooms are at least $100, but on this side this one will cost a maximum of 50.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257620710_27bda63d77_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At 8:40 I had to be at the bus station on the American side to leave for San Antonio. Although it was Sunday and there were no large queues expected at the border, just in case, I woke up at 6 am and went for a walk around the city, at the same time spending the remaining Mexican coins at the kiosk. The danger of the city on the Internet is somewhat exaggerated; at least, 24-hour shops operate quietly there (even without the typical Russian trade through bars), and music from a disco was playing under my windows all night.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257620910_f73867d76e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The city center is dull, even Tijuana is more cheerful.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257620800_8bc151f0f8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are suspiciously many empty houses here, with only bare walls.

<p>
Crossing the Mexico-US border along the Rio Grande River passed without much incident. The Americans charged me 13.5 dollars - 6 for entering the country (at the land border they still issue migration cards, which were abolished at airports a year and a half ago) and another 7.5 fee for two bottles of tequila. In principle, luggage was not scanned, i.e. I could have become a smuggler, but I didn’t risk playing tricks with the American customs officers.
The border terminal is very colorful, the whole room is filled with Mexicans, many sleep on the floor, spread out bedding and covered with blankets. Apparently, these are those who are not allowed into America.
The border guard girl spoke to me in Spanish and was surprised when I said that I prefer English.
