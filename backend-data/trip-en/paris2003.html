<h1>France: Paris</h1>

<h2>Paris</h2>
<p>
In February 2003 I visited Paris. Like the previous trip to the UK, this was a reward for winning school competitions. This time we stayed in a hotel in the center of Paris, not far from the opera.

There was a small diplomatic program - a visit to a French school (Lycee Buffon)

We were also inside the Paris City Hall.

We went to Disneyland one day - I wasn’t particularly inspired by it, but in the end I liked it. The place is really pleasant, although I don't like the rides (and didn't like them even in 2003).

It was snowing that day, which is why some of the rides were closed. There were few visitors, since it was winter, 2003, and there was snow. But we still had to stand in line for a while.

The rest of the days the weather was good. Quiet street in Montmartre:

That time I was at the top of the tower, next to the gargoyles.
