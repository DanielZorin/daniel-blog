<h1>Denmark: Copenhagen, Roskilde, Elsinore, Hillerød</h1>
<i>24-26 April 2012</i>
<h2>Copenhagen</h2>
<p>
Denmark, how long have I wanted to go there. Maybe because I like the name of the country (in Russian it sounds like my name). Maybe because as a child I really loved Lego constructors. I left Denmark for dessert and came here last, having traveled by bus over the strait along the Malmö-Copenhagen bridge. So, Copenhagen.
<p/>

<p>
I thought Denmark had colorful houses like they were made from Lego. This turned out to be partly true.

<p>
Not only this popular Nyhavn embankment is built this way, but also some other streets.
<p/>

<p>
Even like this.

<p>
On the boulevards the flower beds are bursting with flowers.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255302972_60473e9221_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Those streets where the houses are not colorful are similar to Swedish ones with a lot of dark red shades.
<p/>

<p>
Although if you look from above, it looks like Stockholm.
<p/>

<p>
Copenhagen looks much more lively than all the cities in Sweden and Norway. The city does not die in the evening; crowds of cyclists and cars race through the streets.
<p/>

<p>
The star-shaped fortress surrounded by a moat, which looks beautiful on the city map, is in fact fortified with earthen ramparts instead of walls.
<p/>

<p>
Next to it, the cherry blossoms are in full bloom.
<p/>

<p>
Street sign, similar to the Norwegian one.
<p/>

<p>
Original solution.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257076585_a7581a0c25_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Fence around road repair.
<p/>

<p>
Another greeting from Norway.

<p>
In Danish cities there are kilometer posts indicating the distance to other cities.
<p/>

<p>
An interesting feature: on the monograms of the Danish kings, the numbers are not Roman, as is usually used when numbering monarchs, but Arabic.
<p/>

<p>
The metro in Copenhagen is pretty pointless and consists of essentially one line. It seems that it is called a metro for show, so as not to be inferior to other cities where there is a metro. One line would look logical if construction had just begun, but in reality there are about 10 electric train lines running near Copenhagen, and the entire transport system is integrated, with a single plan.
<p/>

<p>
The famous Christiania is easily identified by its painted fences and waving flag.
<p/>

<p>
As everyone knows, you can’t take photographs inside, which is hard to forget, since the entire main street is painted with huge graffiti depicting crossed out cameras from different angles. The central street resembles a bazaar, where instead of vegetables there is marijuana on the shelves. There are several summer cafes where you can try the purchased goods.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256032921_74df9db082_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Outside Pusher Street, Christiania is an unpleasant slum of rickety wooden houses. This is what the back of it looks like.
<p/>

<p>
Residents of the surrounding areas know a lot about cynicism.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256781194_26dad5f149_h.jpg"/>
<p>
What else? Oh yes, the Little Mermaid.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256735016_3f2d5a6c5a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Well, yes, something like that.
<p/>

<h2>Elsinore</h2>
<p>
Everyone knows that something is rotten in the Danish kingdom, and the Danes killed their prince Hamlet. This happened in the city of Elsinore.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256288338_46afe09cd5_h.jpg"/>

<p>
Elsinore is a beautiful city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256836409_e2b524a34d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It's like the Nyhavn promenade from Copenhagen, but spread over several blocks.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257131545_602748138e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Nice.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257131560_3b88ea016e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This alley, by the way, has its own name.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256836764_c51cce714e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Only cars spoil the view. Why would residents of downtown Elsinore park their cars outside their homes? Are you too lazy to walk a block?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257131650_4f1845e7a6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The Elsinore traffic light is a miracle of optimization. There's a red light.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257131640_e8394f14b3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here's the yellow one. If none of them are lit, it means green. It turns out that some percentage of energy is saved.
<p/>

<p>
The castle where Hamlet takes place.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255358477_3ab98ebfcb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Inside the castle there is a playroom for children, which, of course, contains a box of Lego bricks.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255358492_c471879e0b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The castle guard fires a volley of cannons.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256288528_0d6159b3b2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
By the way, they don’t skimp on shells: about 10 guns were fired quite a few times.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257131735_12814b0572_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The shadow of Hamlet's father lives in the dungeons.
<p/>

<p>
I love places where it is completely dark, and you can navigate by taking pictures in front of you with a flash and looking at the photographs.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255358627_6ab94c9df5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Sometimes interesting discoveries happen.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255358577_df0e3b4dad_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Just before leaving, I came across an orchestra of girls in cute uniforms playing the trumpet.
<p/>

<h2>Roskilde</h2>
<p>
The weather was not conducive to long walks.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255577813_7e55fe88fd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here the streets are lined with signs advertising nearby shops.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257019713_383829e0ef_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The main purpose of visiting here is the cathedral where the kings of Denmark are buried. I saw the graves of the rulers of England, Spain, Portugal, Russia, China, but in Sweden I did not get inside the corresponding cathedral.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256418315_de03a8c6a8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The tombs there alternate, like the kings in Denmark for almost five centuries: Frederik - Christian - Frederik - Christian... The chain was interrupted only by the current queen Margrethe II.
<p/>

<h2>Hillerød</h2>
<p>
Danish trains have beautiful and comfortable soft benches.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255450312_c83a8cce66_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a royal palace in Hillerød, but it was already closed at five o'clock in the evening.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256927864_97df47ee66_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A long winding street lined with shops leads to the palace. The rest of the city consists of small private houses.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256927829_c455fe9bc8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But the rain stopped and it was possible to walk around the park, not without pleasure.
