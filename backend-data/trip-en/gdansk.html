<h1>Poland: Gdansk</h1>
<i>4-5 January 2017</i>
<h2>Gdansk</h2>
<p>
Wizz Air and Ryanair flights connected successfully in Gdansk, I had a night for a transfer. It's always a pleasure to visit such a beautiful city like Gdansk again.

The airport is simply gigantic for such a relatively small city, although Wizz Air has many flights from here. It was built for the 2012 European Football Championship.

Since the flight from Finland was delayed, I was in the city center after dusk.

A lot of time was spent trying to check into the automated hotel, where one of the combination locks refused to work. After this, the only strength left was for the march to Biedronka.

It's hard to resist stocking up when it's cheap.

The next morning the flight was at about 9 am, so we had to take the first train to the airport at about 7. During the night it got very cold and a snowstorm began.

Empty sleepy streets were covered with snow.

It’s good that Zabka stores open at 6 am, you can warm up there.

The pigeons hid from the cold in the underground passage near the station.

I made it to the airport, but due to a snowstorm the flight was delayed for three hours, and I was late for my connection in Milan.
