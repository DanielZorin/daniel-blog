<h1>Brazil: São Paulo, Santos</h1>
<i>2-4, 25-27 March, 16 April, 1-9, 18-22 May, 1-4 June 2021</i>
<h2>São Paulo</h2>
<p>
No less than eight years have passed since my first trip to South America. First, I methodically traveled around Europe, then Asia, then Oceania, with periodic visits to North America, which is easier and cheaper to get to. The time has come to begin a thorough study of this part of the world, and the closest and most accessible country is Brazil. All roads in Brazil lead to São Paulo, especially now that there are almost no international flights from other cities. As a result, I was in São Paulo a whopping 6 times in three months, for a total of almost 20 days.

<p>
I stayed at the Calstar Hotel, the price (100 reais for a double, 70 for a single), quality, excellent breakfast and location suited me completely, so I stayed there every time. This is the historical center - not the cleanest and safest area, but conveniently located and inexpensive.
<p/>

<p>
On the street next to the hotel there were prostitutes every evening, and exclusively transsexual ones. I have not seen them anywhere else in São Paulo or in other cities, although I have been to other areas that are considered red light districts, in particular on Augusta Street, which leads directly from my hotel to the Paulista district.
<p/>

<p>
I walked up and down the center of São Paulo. It can be roughly divided into two parts, separated by the former bed of the Anhangabau River, which now flows underground. On one side is the historical center with skyscrapers (Called Se = Cathedral), on the other is a shopping area with pedestrian streets and shops (Called Republica after Republica Square). Republica Square:

<p>
In Brazil, buildings often have names. Building "Italy":
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51321085217_89ffd39848_o.jpg">
<p>
Main pedestrian street. I never remembered its name because it is long (Barão de Itapetininga).

<p>
This is the main barometer of anti-coronavirus measures. At the end of March, almost everything was closed, but in April trade was already in full swing, although restrictions had not yet been officially lifted. This is April 16th:

<p>
And this is a Friday evening in early May, in theory there should be a curfew at 9 pm.

<p>
Sign of the times: street vendors are selling masks. In Brazil, most people wear reusable masks rather than surgical ones. There are masks with different designs, logos, anime characters, etc.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51321095352_770516ca31_o.jpg">
<p>
Another sign of the times: distribution of food to the poor in public squares, and a huge queue.

<p>
Santa Ifigenia street, where electronics are sold. Promoters walk around with boxes of remote controls. I stayed there 8 years ago; this area, although not far from Republic Square, is worse in terms of security.
<p/>

<p>
If you reach the end of this street, you will find yourself in the most dangerous area of ​​São Paulo, popularly called “crackland” (cracolândia), after the name of the substance that the residents of the streets there use. Walking there even during the day is super dangerous - much worse than in the favelas. So I was a little freaked out when I took a taxi from the airport at 3am and the driver coolly drove through the area (even though he could have driven around it and it wouldn't have even been longer). An ambulance and police were standing on one of the corners, and someone was lying on the ground, perhaps no longer alive.

There is also Park da Luz nearby. It seems that in the evening you can pick up a girl or a tranny there for 50 reais, but I didn’t check this, since the place is uncomfortable even during the day.

From the side, the Banespa Tower looks higher. The secret here is that Mirante do Vale stands at the bottom of the valley, and the Banespa Tower is on a hill.

I always went to the historical center of São Paulo for lunch at the restaurant Bovinu's, which was open only at lunch on a per kilo basis, 70 reais by default, and a 20% discount after 2 PM.

The real modern center of São Paulo is Paulista Avenue, south of the historical center. Between them lies a Japanese quarter and a hilly area with expensive real estate. In Japantown there are round lanterns everywhere.

<p>
It turns out this is an unusual concept. Typically, in all museums, paintings are arranged in chronological order, from the early Renaissance to Cubism and Socialist Realism. But here, on the contrary, the farther from the entrance, the further you go into the depths of centuries. All the paintings are in one large hall in rows, and not hanging on the walls. So this one hall has a number of paintings equivalent to ten halls of an ordinary museum.

There is also no division by country; the works of Brazilian artists are on a par with foreign ones of the same era.

Here you can also see what is on the back of the paintings. And there are a lot of stickers that are attached when a painting is sent to another country for an exhibition.

In São Paulo, I traveled to some areas outside the center, but not as much as in other big cities (for example, <a href="../tokyo">Tokyo</a > or <a href="../oxford">London</a>). It is convenient to travel in São Paulo by metro, which has many lines. Moreover, they belong to three different companies, plus the suburban trains are essentially also part of the metro system. Some lines run somewhere on the outskirts, allowing you only to transfer to the line leading to the center.
<p/>

<p>
One day there was a strike in the metro: trains on three lines ran only in the center area, turning around 5-7 stations before the end of the line, and another line was closed. At the same time, the lines of other companies worked. The strike lasted one day.

Let's look at São Paulo from above. Since I've flown through local airports many times, there have been good views at times during takeoff and landing.

There are three airports in São Paulo: international Guarulhos, domestic Congonhas and low-cost Viracopos (which I have not been to). Guarulhos is formally a separate city.

<p>
To Guarulhos, the main airport of the country, buses run once an hour, and trains also run once an hour (after the train you still need to take a shuttle to the main terminal). At the same time, train and bus schedules are such that there are 10 minutes between their departures, and if you are late, you have to wait 50-60 minutes.

I went to the observation deck. I was there back in 2013, but it has changed since then. Previously, entry was free, and there was a long queue. Now it costs $4, and the observation deck itself has been redone - it is now not at the very top, but several floors below, and not 360 degrees, but two balconies, where the glass also makes it somewhat difficult to take photographs.

Santos stands on a peninsula and has two centers - the old one on the northern shore near a narrow bay and the new one on the southern shore with access to the ocean.
