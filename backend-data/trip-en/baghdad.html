<h1>Iraq: Baghdad, Samarra, Babylon, Hilla</h1>
<i>26-28 October 2023</i>
<h2>Baghdad</h2>
<p>
Iraq has been an extremely isolated country for many decades - wars, sanctions, terrorist attacks. Everything changed in 2021, when visas began to be issued upon arrival. Over the past couple of years, travel around the country has become easier, and the number of checks at checkpoints has decreased. Now you can easily move around the country that was cradle of several ancient civilization.

Cheap hotels in Baghdad are located in the area between Tahrir and Firdos squares. Firdos Square was right next to me. This place is famous for the 2003 video of the demolition of the monument to Saddam Hussein on the day of the fall of Baghdad.

<p>
The monument stood in the middle of this circle. Judging by the blogs, in 2012 the pedestal and the remains of the legs still stood.

There is also a beauty salon with real flamingos on the square.

The hotel is ok. Cost 40k dinars ($25 if exchanged at the black market rate).

Let's go for a walk around Baghdad. It's quite good here. Poster girls advertise Coca-Cola.

Tahrir Square can be considered the central square of Baghdad.

As in Iran, portraits of fallen military personnel are often hung on the streets in Iraq, especially since Iraq had a large-scale war with ISIS in 2014-2017, and there are many veterans. The man in the middle with glasses is especially common - it's Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who died along with Iranian General Soleimani in 2020.

<p>
On the poster above is Ali al-Sistani, the spiritual leader of the Shiites in Iraq. Below is Muqtada al-Sadr, who became famous back in 2003-2004 as the leader of the “Mahdi Army,” which staged an uprising against the American occupation in southern Iraq. Now the very aged, gray-haired al-Sadr (although he is less than 50 years old) is the leader of one of the largest parties and is fighting battles in parliament. The transition of political struggle to an unarmed form is reassuring.

<p>
But most often on the streets of Iraq (the southern half) you come across a portrait of this man, who at first glance looks like Jesus Christ. This is Imam Ali, the fourth caliph and heir of the Prophet Muhammad from the Shia point of view. In general, images of people are not welcome in Islam; for example, you will not find portraits of Muhammad in any mosque. Sunnism as a whole presupposes reverence for Allah first of all, and the most radical form of Sunnism (Wahhabism) even approves of the destruction of graves so that they are not worshiped. In Shiism, on the contrary, the role of martyrs for the faith is very important, similar to the veneration of saints in Christianity. In Iran they still don’t hang portraits, but in Iraq they are everywhere. This is probably a unique Muslim country in this regard.

A couple of kilometers north of Tahrir Square is the oldest part of Baghdad.

Now, apparently, they have started a large-scale restoration there to make the area attractive to tourists. Not many old buildings have survived here.

Iraqis love very sweet tea, and add sugar a lot. The cups are similar to Turkish ones.

The most visible element of the landscape in Iraq, which distinguishes it from other countries, is the concrete slabs used for fencing. They look like pieces of the Berlin Wall scattered around Berlin. Here they played an important role in ensuring security in those days when terrorist attacks occurred almost daily. Not only government institutions are fenced with concrete blocks, but also large mosques, which have also been targets of terrorist attacks, as there is a confrontation between Shiites and Sunnis.

On the western bank of the Tigris River is the Green Zone, a government area. During dangerous times, few foreigners in Baghdad (mostly diplomats) lived only there, and the rest of Baghdad was a red zone. Nowadays it is still impossible to get there on foot, but the roads have recently been opened to car travel to relieve congestion on city highways. So I took a taxi there a couple of times, and was able to see local monuments that cannot be reached on foot. In general, the green zone looks like this:

The Swords of Qadisiyah is a double arch erected by Saddam to commemorate his "victory" in the war against Iran. Let me remind you that in 1980, Iraq attacked Iran and occupied the border areas with predominantly Arab population. A couple of years later, the Iranians liberated their territory and launched a counterattack on Iraqi territory in order to overthrow Hussein and organize an Islamic revolution. After another 6 years, the Iraqis were able to push the Iranians back beyond the old border, and as a result, both countries declared victory.

<p>
In Iran, this war is called the "eight-year sacred defense." In Iraq in the past it was called "Saddam's Qadisiyah" - in honor of the Battle of Qadisiyah, when the Arabs defeated the Persians in the 7th century and annexed Persia to the Caliphate.

You are not allowed to bring any electronics inside, not even phones. This is the only mosque with such measures that I have visited in Iraq. That's why I can't show you any photos from the inside.

<h2>Samarra</h2>
<p>
Samarra is a city north of Baghdad where the Malwiya Minaret, a World Heritage Site, is located. Getting there is not easy, since tourists are not allowed into the city freely, only with an escort.

A dome is visible in the distance - that is the al-Askari mosque. Two Shia imams are buried there. Since the region north of Baghdad is generally Sunni, this city is apparently guarded so heavily. Once there was a terrorist attack right in this mosque about 15 years ago. The taxi driver refused to take me there, even for an extra charge, unfortunately.
