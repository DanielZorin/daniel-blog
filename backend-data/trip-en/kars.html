<h1>Turkey: Doğubayazıt, Iğdır, Kars, Ani</h1>
<i>1-5 September 2022</i>
<h2>Doğubayazıt</h2>
<p>
Doğubayazıt is the closest city to the Iranian border, but also interesting in itself, since here was one of the most important fortresses in the east of the empire, which was besieged during almost every Russian-Turkish war. Historically, the city and fortress were located on the mountain, but were destroyed in 1930 during the suppression of the Kurdish uprising, which made Bayazit the capital of the proclaimed Kurdistan. After this, a new city was built in the valley and named Doğubayazıt (eastern Bayazit).

<p>
Bayazit turned out to be a rather large and rather lively town.
<p/>

<p>
It is interesting that during the Russian-Turkish War of 1877-78, Russian veteran soldiers, who also witnessed the Crimean War of 1853-56, noted that Bayazit had become greatly impoverished during this time. The reason for this was the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, after that the flow of goods by land fell sharply.

On the mountain near the city are the remains of the old Bayazit fortress, as well as the palace of Ishak Pasha (the local governor of the late 18th century)

<h2>Iğdır</h2>
<p>
Iğdır is a regional center in the very east of Turkey. It’s also close to the tiny but very important border between Turkey and Azerbaijan for two allied countries. This city became Turkish only in 1921 under the Treaty of Kars; before that, for almost 100 years it was part of the Russian Empire, and until 1828 it belonged to Persia. Thus, Iğdır was Russian much longer than neighboring Kars, but nothing remains from this period, apparently because it was a very small county town in the Yerevan province.

There is one unusual, one might say scandalous, attraction in Iğdır. This is a monument to the victims of the genocide of the Turks by the Armenians.
<p/>

<p>
Downstairs there is a small museum with memories of those times. In short, the point is that there was ethnic (more precisely, rather religious) cleansing, but somehow the event to which it was a reaction was ignored.

<h2>Kars</h2>
<p>
Kars is one of the largest and most interesting cities in the far east of Turkey. Its peculiarity is that from 1878 to 1918 it was part of the Russian Empire, and unlike Iğdır, it was the capital of the Kars region, and was built in accordance with a master plan similar to other Russian cities of that time. Therefore, in Kars you can see a lot of things that will remind you of a provincial city in central Russia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52419218194_aa1f98472d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the center of Kars there is a picturesque castle on a hill. As I understand it, the historical Turkish part of the city was on the slopes of this hill, as well as on the site of that large square where the inscription “Kars” stands, but it has not been preserved.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52419375600_01d37618d7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Two dozen busts were placed in bulk on the square.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52419375460_01a37b70d5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
If you get closer, you can see the remains of foundations on the slopes.
<p/>

<p>
The Armenian church has survived.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52418427232_067dcf3a63_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Entrance to the castle is free.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52418427172_2d357d3113_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You can even go by car.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52419374100_aae55c3273_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At the very top is Ataturk’s profile and the inscription “The Motherland is grateful to you.”
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52418426907_ca0f3f8b53_h.jpg"/>

The area along the river where the old part of the city was. From it to the south there are three straight parallel streets with historical Russian buildings.
<p/>

<p>
On the other side the city ends. A crowd of geese are being chased along the river.

<p>
Along the hills you can see other small forts, most likely built in the 19th century for defense.

<p>
At the foot of the castle there is a pedestrian street with restaurants. Several years ago, Kars became very popular among Turkish tourists who came by night train (Ankara - Kars is the farthest route of Turkish railways). The railroad company even made additional tourist trains.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52419374410_ad6d646257_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Turkish tourists are attracted not only by the remoteness of the city, but also by the “Russian” flavor. Now there is a cafe "Raskolnikov".
<p/>

<p>
In Moscow, I have never been to the Pushkin cafe (<i>it's a notoriously expensive place</i>), but at least I did in Kars! The local specialty is roast goose.

They also make cheese in Kars; there are many cheese shops here.
<p/>

The central streets of Kars were built under Russian rule, and the architecture here is easily recognizable.

Away from the main street there are houses completely in ruins, just like in some Saratov or Nizhny Novgorod.

For some reason in Turkey it is called "Baltic style".
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52418427617_2820da204d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Many "Baltic" houses are dark in color, so they look more like Armenia than central Russia.

The monument to Ataturk on the square in the old city, I wouldn’t be surprised if Alexander II originally stood on this pedestal (if Kars had not gone to Turkey, Lenin would have been placed there).

<p>
Of course, it was an Orthodox church, then a gym, and closer to our time they built a mosque.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52418941241_ad140fa9aa_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Next to the mosque there is an alley of busts of the great Turks - the founders of states. It is not clear, however, how Batu (Batu Khan) got in there; it seems that Mongols and Turks are not the same people.

<h2>Ani</h2>
<p>
Ani is an ancient Armenian city, the capital of the Armenian state of the 9th-11th centuries. In my opinion, this is one of the most interesting archaeological zones, even by the standards of Turkey that is filled with ancient Roman and Greek ruins.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52418449202_1568014407_h.jpg"/>

<p>
Ani is an hour's drive from Kars, right on the border with Armenia (which has been closed for 30 years). Once a day a bus runs there from the center of Kars especially for tourists. The road is on a plain, this is the Armenian highland.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52419398925_6638352392_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Near Ani is the modern village of Ocakli.

The fortress wall at the entrance. The city has a triangular shape, it is surrounded on two sides by the Akhuryan River, along which the border runs, and on the third by this wall.

<p>
When you pass through the walls, you find yourself in the territory of the former city. It is a rare case that the outer walls, and not just the military citadel, have been preserved, so that one can appreciate the size of the ancient city (another similar example: <a href="../sanliurfa">Diyarbakir</a>). According to historians, 100-200 thousand people could live in the city.

It can be seen that wheel tracks lead to it, and before my eyes people were driving up there.

Ani was destroyed in the 14th century and completely abandoned in the 18th. During the Armenian-Turkish War of 1918-1921 they even wanted to completely demolish it and caused great damage, and for decades the condition of the monuments was poorly monitored for obvious reasons. Due to the proximity of the border, entry was limited for a long time; only in 2004 Ani was opened for tourism, and it began to be restored with the help of UNESCO.
