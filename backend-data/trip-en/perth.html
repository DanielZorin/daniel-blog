<h1>Australia: Perth, Fremantle</h1>
<i>23-26 April 2018</i>
<h2>Perth</h2>
<p>
Perth is the capital of Western Australia and the most remote city in the world with a population of over 1 million people. Three quarters of the population of a state half the size of Europe lives in this city. Much of Western Australia is a hot desert, with only a corner of the southwest around Perth enjoying a refreshing Mediterranean climate.

Perth city center is beautiful.

The whole rather large block is completely pedestrian.

The post office in the central square has been converted into H&M. This chain's stores in Australia like to occupy historic buildings.

The London courtyard is a kind of design inspired by English architecture of the 16th-17th centuries, built in 1937.

Suburban trains. The system is not bad, several lines, they run frequently. The ticket is the same as the buses; it is best to buy a day pass.

Familiar design? Yes, this is the Australian Burger King. It is called differently because in Australia there was already a restaurant called "Burger King", so the new name remained.

In Perth I spent a lot of time getting to know the Australian fauna. To begin with, I went to Pinnaroo Valley Cemetery, which can be reached by train.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256634136_d4202725ac_o.jpg">
<p>
The cemetery itself is interesting. Instead of tombstones, there are flat memorial plaques located in rows along the paths.

<p>
But most importantly, there are just crowds of kangaroos living here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257380859_95429337c1_o.jpg">
<p>
The kangaroos here are wild, which means they are shy, but still not as wild as in other places.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255905707_269ae0716b_o.jpg">
<p>
If I stand, then the kangaroos also stand and watch.

But when you start moving towards them, they run away.

It is much more difficult to meet other living creatures right on the street, so I went to the zoo. Many native animals are rarely found in zoos in other countries, so you can only see them here (or in other Australian zoos). Here is the echidna - a long-nosed marsupial hedgehog that lays eggs.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256835603_7156b4de0c_o.jpg">
<p>
In principle, it is possible to meet echidnas in the wild outside large cities, although they try to hide. The platypus, related to echidnas (but visually not similar at all), is much more difficult to find - not only does it live in water, it is also active mainly at night. Platypuses also do not live well in captivity; only in Sydney they were able to build a suitable environment for them at the zoo with an improvised river.

Emu. There was even a “war” with these birds in 1932, due to the fact that they greatly harmed farmers.

Finally, I met another representative of the Australian fauna - the black swan. They are now found in Europe and America, but they originated from Australia and are simply taking root well in other countries.

Swans can easily be found in Perth's city parks near ponds and lakes.

Last time I walked through the Aldi store, and now I will talk about the most common store in Australia - Coles. This particular Coles is small and located in the heart of Perth.
If in Brisbane bananas cost almost 5 dollars, then here they cost 2.90.

Bread. In Australia, as in Asia and America, there is almost no bread, except for toast bread. They actually sell baguettes here, at a normal price of 1.50. Other types of fresh bread, if found anywhere, are very expensive, about 5 dollars each.

As a result, prices at Coles are a little higher than at Aldi, by ~10 percent, but the store is easier to find, and there is more choice (especially meat).

<h2>Fremantle</h2>
<p>
Fremantle is a port suburb of Perth, the first settlement in Western Australia. Fremantle definitely feels like a separate full-fledged city, and not a residential area. The historic center here is one of the most beautiful and best preserved in Australia.

<h2>Rottnest Island</h2>
<p>
Rottnest Island, off the coast of Western Australia, was once a prison, then a military base, and is now a resort visited by 500,000 people a year. The ferry from Fremantle takes 40 minutes and costs 50 Australian dollars (35 USD), half of which is a fee for entering the protected area.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256103611_2eec6e1268_o.jpg">
<p>
There is almost no permanent population on the island, except for hotel staff. In the village near the ferry terminal there are mainly restaurants and former administrative buildings.
