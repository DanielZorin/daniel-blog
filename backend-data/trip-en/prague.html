<h1>Czech Republic: Prague, Pilsen, Kutna Hora, Cesky Krumlov, Brno</h1>
<i>30 November - 4 December 2018</i>
<h2>Prague</h2>
<p>
The first time I was in Prague was back in 2009. Then I spent about a week in the city and explored it quite well. The main disadvantage of Prague is that there are too many people in the center, more than in <a href="../paris">Paris</a> and comparable to <a href="../venice">Venice</a>. It's probably better to walk at night, like in Venice, so that there are no crowds.
<p/>

<p>
The central square is literally bursting with crowds, and this is normal time, although the Christmas trade is going on, but on the calendar it is only December 1st.

I climbed onto a small platform for the panorama.

Charles Bridge looks something like this.

You can't see from the outside.

<p>
Prague Castle. Security measures at the entrance are increased - people are screened with x-rays.

<p>
In this part of the city you don’t have to wait very late for the crowd to clear up - there are no bars or restaurants (inside the castle at least), so few people come here in the evening.
<p/>

Golden alley. At night it looks quite nice and cozy.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256664936_bebea66107_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It’s better not to go here during the day - besides the fact that the entrance is paid, there is a crowd here during the day, and there’s not much to do here except look at the facades - the entire street is souvenir shops.

<p>
The architecture of Prague as a whole looks something like this, it has many similarities with other cities of Austria-Hungary, including <a href="../vienna">Vienna</a> and <a href="../budapest">Budapest</a>.

From time to time, Gothic architecture is visible (mostly churches).

Prague has a gigantic train station, the most interesting part of which is the dome above the entrance, which you might not notice unless you look for it.

The main entrance to the station is now not through the historical facade, but directly into the underground passage under the tracks.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257411374_266d55f5f9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The main entrance is separated by a busy road, and few people use it.

I lived some distance from the center, it was a 40-50 minute walk, or a tram ride. What's good about Prague is that all tourists are in the center, and outside the center everything is good and inexpensive. A good hotel costs less than $30.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255936652_90b20caf42_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The architecture in this area is also great.

In the Czech Republic, almost all churches (with the exception of the most famous ones, where admission is paid) are closed; they are apparently opened only once a week during services.

Outside the center, eating even in a restaurant is inexpensive. A large dinner with pork knuckle as the main course cost $20. Beer is ridiculously cheap - from $1.
<p/>

<p>
Another interesting fact about Prague - there are a lot of authentic Chinese restaurants here, run by the Chinese, and everything there is like in a real Chinese restaurant, right down to the menu design above the counter. They are found both in the historical center and in my area. In no other city in Europe have I seen so much authentic Chinese food, so, paradoxically, in Prague it is worth eating not only knucklebones and dumplings, but also noodles with rice.
<p/>

One dish costs 3-5 dollars.

<h2>Pilsen</h2>
<p>
Pilsen (Plzen) is a large city in the west of the Czech Republic. I actually planned to use it as an intermediate stop between Karlovy Vary and Prague, but due to bad weather the plane from Moscow was landed at Prague airport, so I didn’t go to Karlovy Vary, so I went to Pilsen there and back. One of the most picturesque train stations in Europe was discovered in Pilsen.

<h2>Kutna Hora</h2>
<p>
Kutna Hora is a small ancient city an hour's drive from Prague.

I came to Kutna Hora by bus, and decided to go back by train, and the station is far from the center, it took an hour to walk.

<p>
If you don't know in advance, you might not realize that this is one of the most unusual and impressive places in Europe. At the end of the 19th century, Prince Schwarzenberg (one of the main noble families of Bohemia/Czech Republic) ordered the ossuary (bone storage) in the basement of this church to be restored. The storage of bones in itself is not a rare phenomenon, although usually they are not public (but it happens the other way around, for example, <a href="../paris">in Paris</a>), but the local carving master Frantisek Rint showed remarkable creativity and used bones to decorate the church.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255597307_db5f58bd29_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are similar places in Europe, at least the chapel of bones in the Portuguese city <a href="../lisboa">Evora</a>, which I did not get to due to restoration, and the Capuchin crypt in Rome.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257074649_cdf1836dff_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here the author went a little further, since not only the frame of the altar and the “drawings” on the walls, but even giant chandeliers were made from bones.

Once upon a time, this outskirts of Kutná Hora (Sedlec) was an independent important city, so it also has its own Gothic cathedral.

<h2>Cesky Krumlov</h2>
<p>
Cesky Krumlov is one of the most beautiful cities in the Czech Republic; It takes three hours to drive from Prague, but it’s worth it (especially since bus travel in the Czech Republic is not particularly expensive).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256200443_741c6a42a6_h.jpg"/>

<p>
On the steep bank of the river stands the Schwarzenberg castle.
