<h1>Malaysia: Kuala Lumpur, Malacca</h1>
<i>11-14, 18-20 April, 2-3 May 2023</i>
<h2>Kuala Lumpur</h2>
<p>
I haven't been to the eastern part of Asia for three years - for more than two years this part of the world was almost completely closed off due to Covid. I wanted to see the familiar beloved places, check how years without tourists had affected them, and eat durians and mangosteens. When I saw a two-way ticket from Istanbul to Kuala Lumpur for $475, I thought that was fateful.

Accomodation in KL, and in Malaysia in general, has become significantly more expensive over the past three years. You can’t rent an apartment for $20 near KLCC any more; it’s more likely closer to $30. I splurged on the 17th floor apartment with a view and a rooftop pool. View from my balcony:

View to the south. By 2023, the Merdeka 118 tower, the second tallest building in the world, has been almost completed, but the observation deck there has not opened yet. Now it is visible from anywhere along with the TV tower.

On the top floor, where the pool, gym and cafe are, you could walk around the perimeter of the building and see all the panoramic views.

This building (The Colony by Infinitum) was built recently; in 2020 it did not exist at all. They did not have time to remove the plywood in the elevators to protect them from construction dirt.

A pedestrian bridge was built near KLCC connecting the area in front of the Petronas Towers and the Kampung Bahru area (previously they were separated by a river and a highway). The bridge has also become a landmark of the area.

There are no Covid restrictions in Malaysia, but you can still meet people wearing masks (especially in the subway there are quite a few of them). The last time I saw people wearing masks was almost a year ago during my trip to the Caribbean. There are still pandemic-era announcements posted in many places.

It is forbidden to fold things in the laundry room - take them home and fold them there.

The closest shopping center to me was Quill Mall - I went there often in 2019. It seems that more than half of the retail space is empty, with life only on the lower floors.

I don’t know what was here before, but now a large square has been built, skyscrapers and an interchange hub are appearing around it (there is already a metro station on the new line, but there aren’t too many people, since almost everything is unfinished).

Although I lived in Kuala Lumpur, albeit for a short time, I traveled the city far and wide, but nevertheless, when planning my trip, I easily threw in a lot of places where I had not been - those that are not very convenient to get to, those that opened in the last three years, and ones I didn't go to because I didn't want to spend money or have been to similar places in other cities in Malaysia. So the program in Kuala Lumpur was very rich, and not just walks through markets and restaurants. The first such place is Tianhou Temple. It is located south of Chinatown and east of KL Sentral deep in residential development.

In the three years that I have not been to Malaysia, a new metro line has been opened in Kuala Lumpur - Putrajaya Line. Another new line has already been drawn on the maps, it will mostly run in the suburbs of <a href="http://goo.gl/5fx83T">Klang and Shah Alam</a>, although it will not open until 2024. Well, the Putrajaya line, as the name suggests, goes to the formal capital of Malaysia, but in a different way than the previously existing railway (Airport express). As usual, I went along the new line, photographing through the windshield.

The new line is MRT, just like the Green Line. The pink and orange lines are considered LRT, although in fact both are metro, not trams. Perhaps the MRT has longer trains.

While living in Turkey, I began to visit museums more often, since they are free. Because of this, I began to visit museums more often in other countries. In particular, in Malaysia, I have not been to the central museums, and this time I also visited them, fortunately they are located closely in the area of ​​​​the national mosque.
