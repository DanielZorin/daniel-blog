<h1>Jamaica: Kingston, Spanish Town, Montego Bay, Negril</h1>
<i>14-19 May 2022</i>
<h2>Kingston</h2>
<p>
Although Jamaica has a certain romantic Rastafarian aura, its crime rate ranks second in the world, exactly between <a href="../el-salvador">El Salvador</a> and <a href="../honduras">Honduras</a>. Crime is traditionally mainly concentrated in the capital of the country - the city of Kingston, so I explored this city with extreme caution. There weren’t even any airbnbs or cheap hotels in the city center, everything was further away from the seashore towards the hills - all because the center is a poor area, only the slums to the west are worse.

<p>
Visually it looks more like Latin America than the Caribbean.

<p>
If you walk a couple of blocks away from the central square, it’s a bit empty.
<p/>

<p>
There are a couple of high-rise buildings closer to the seashore.

They stand somehow alone, and there is nothing special between them.

Most of the seashore is occupied by some factories.

Many local buses, including those to the airport, start from the central square.

There are posters all over Jamaica telling people not to drink and drive.

I rented a room through AirBnB on the northern outskirts of Kingston, which turned out to be a good, prosperous area.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52091190311_1427466c69_o.jpg">
<p>
It’s just like America here - everything is designed for cars, a one-story area, the streets are very long and there are almost no intersections, which is why I had to walk more than 2 kilometers to the nearest square, although in a straight line it would have been a maximum of 500 meters.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52091436379_372e26418b_o.jpg">
<p>
The actual area. There are a couple of dirty, lame fast food places on it. In general, food in Jamaica is as bad as other Caribbean islands.
<p/>

On the second day it was a damn Sunday, as always nothing was going anywhere, I took a taxi (luckily Uber works in Kingston) to New Kingston - the second center of the city.

Since it was Sunday, it was very empty, and I didn’t feel very safe, although the streets were mostly occupied by homeless and beggars, but still I didn’t hang around there for long.

Supermarket. It looks stylish, but in fact the prices there are no higher than in ordinary unpresentable stores.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52090159282_a907b0d8b1_o.jpg">
<p>
The currency of Jamaica is the Jamaican dollar, the exchange rate to the American dollar is approximately 1 to 150. Therefore, prices with dollar signs and huge numbers look funny. Wine for $2000.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52091432139_5efe7bd33a_o.jpg">
<p>
But in general, Jamaica is very expensive, just like other Caribbean islands. Life is apparently not easy for the locals, with an average salary of $500 and food prices higher than New York. One apple costs a dollar.

Intercity bus terminal. It's funny that on the map the terminal is marked in one place, I ordered a taxi there, but the taxi driver said that there are no buses from there, since it was built far from the center (in fact, about a kilometer on foot, but through a desolate area), so there is just a huge field with platforms and almost no buses.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52091668955_6d0ae1ab84_o.jpg">
<p>
Buses in Jamaica are packed to the brim, as in other impoverished countries. They even put folding seats in the aisles.

Kingston Airport is located very interestingly on an island connected to the main part of Jamaica by a long and narrow spit of natural origin. When landing, the plane made a circle over the city, so I could see everything clearly.

At the end of the spit, a built-up area is visible - this is the city of Port Poyal, which was the main center of piracy in the Caribbean in the 17th century, but was destroyed by an earthquake in 1692.
<p/>

Busts of presidents at Kingston Airport. There are a lot of busts, but there is no working ATM at this airport, and SIM cards, as I was told at the information desk, are sold only on departure after control (when no one needs them anymore). The exchange rate at exchange offices is also extortionate, I exchanged 10 dollars to get to the center.
<p/>

But first I went in the other direction, to Port Royal, since bus travel costs only 60 cents.

The Blue Mountains begin on the northeastern outskirts of Kingston, I lived there, and minibuses went to the mountains from the nearest square (but not on Sunday).

<h2>Spanish Town</h2>
<p>
Spanish Town was the former capital of Jamaica until the second half of the 19th century. It is now a suburb of Kingston. From the name it is clear that this is a city founded by Spanish colonists, not English.

<h2>Montego Bay</h2>
<p>
Montego Bay is the second city of Jamaica, located on the northwest coast. It has its own airport, which is much larger and more civilized than Kingston, since this is where 99% of tourists from the USA arrive. Also, cruise ships call at Montego Bay, not Kingston, so it's a very different Jamaica than the capital. Or not really?
<p/>

<p>
The journey across the island was surprisingly fast, despite the old, crowded bus. To get to the northern coast, you need to drive through the pass.

I rented an apartment on the heights above the city (as usual, there was nothing in the center). A cruise ship is visible in the distance, a rare sight in the Caribbean these days.
