<h1>Ethiopia: Jijiga, Harar, Dire Dawa, Adama, Addis Ababa</h1>
<i>11-16 July 2024</i>
<h2>Jijiga</h2>
<p>
Somalia borders the Ethiopian province of Somalia (formerly Ogaden) to the west. The capital Jijiga is very close to the border on the road to Hargeisa, so it was my first stop.

<p>
Though, at first I spent half a day at customs, waiting for them to fill out my customs declaration. In the end, I didn't need it on my way out.

<p>
During 40 km to Jijiga we had to get off at checkpoints several times, once they even searched my things.

<p>
I was planning to arrive in Jijiga at 10am and then go on to Harar that same day. But I ended up arriving at 5am and spent the night in a hotel. There are two long, wide streets in the city that intersect at the central square.

Central square:

<p>
For some reason, there are men with shovels and picks on this square, apparently wanting to get hired to work in the mine.
<p/>

<p>
There are quite a lot of hotels for such a non-touristy city. It seems that other Ethiopian cities had fewer hotels.

<p>
It's interesting that they are inspecting only the minibus itself. No one inspected passengers or their luggage, you just sit on the side of the road and wait, then your minibus pulls up, you get in, and go on.
<p/>

Altars are starting to appear along the roads, just like in Greece. Ethiopia is a mostly Christian country.

<h2>Harar</h2>
<p>
Harar is a historic city in eastern Ethiopia, one of the few cities in Africa listed as a World Heritage Site. Inside the fortress walls, the historical architecture has been completely preserved, including about 100 mosques.
<p/>

Only a few central streets are for cars, the rest are pedestrian.
<p/>

<p>
Parallel to the pedestrian entrance to the city, on this side is the market.

As in Arab countries, only the walls face the street, and the houses are inside the courtyard. Here the city is very dense, and in each courtyard there are several separate houses.

<h2>Dire Dawa</h2>
<p>
Dire Dawa is one of the largest cities in Ethiopia, and one of three that have the status of a full-fledged region (like Addis Ababa and Harar). The city is young, founded in the early 20th century around the railway station. At that time, the road from Addis Ababa to Djibouti was being built, Harar was on the way, but it is on a high hill, so the station was built below. And now it has grown into a full-fledged city. However, there is nothing special to see here, except for the train station.
<p/>

<p>
While looking for a place to stay in the center, at first I came across inns at bars. The rooms there were so-so, and I expected a lot of noise in the evening. In the end I wandered into a more respectable hotel, only the most expensive suite was available, although it cost only $25, so I was happy. Though, they hadn’t had time to clean it up after the mephedrone party of the previous guests.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945047262_6948da0c53_o.jpg" >
<p>
More precisely, it was probably a party with khat. I saw other hotel guests with those brooms later. But it's funny anyway, we're used to the fact that when someone throws a party, there should be bottles of alcohol or beer cans left behind. And here we have only the purest drinking water.
<p/>

While waiting for the room to be cleaned, I had lunch with a dish called "tibs" - fried pieces of meat with rice.
<p/>

For some reason, everyone buys from this woman, although there are several others sitting nearby, and you can buy from them without waiting in line. Probably the most powerful weed.

<h2>Train ride</h2>
<p>
There aren't many places in Africa where you can take a passenger train, so I wanted to try the Ethiopian railways. The line from Addis Ababa to Djibouti is the only one that works in Ethiopia. It was built by the French in the early 20th century (Djibouti was a French colony), and modernized by the Chinese in the 21st. The train takes two days, the first day from Addis Ababa to Dire Dawa, the second day from Dire Dawa to Djibouti (and back again, two days). As a result, departures in each direction are not every day, but every other day. A ticket to Adama costs about $11, half as much for locals. The ride is supposed to take about 7 hours...

Everything would have been fine if it weren't for the stops. Not the ones at the stations, but between them - the train could stop somewhere and stand for 30 minutes. Or 60. And we even left with a delay of about an hour.

The train was supposed to arrive in Adama at 3 o'clock, but it arrived at 10 o'clock, 7 hours late! I didn't count on that, and arrived very hungry and exhausted. Usually, when I travel, I eat one big meal a day - dinner. In the morning, 90% of restaurants are closed anyway, and it's easier to eat a couple of cookies or fruits - that's about all I had, and I had to stick to it until late in the evening, since nothing was sold on the train at all.

<h2>Adama</h2>
<p>
I learned about the city of Adama while researching what cities are within a day trip radius from Addis Ababa - Adama is essentially the only large one. Wikivoyage claims that Addis Ababa residents come here on weekends, but what they do here is not very clear.

<p>
I arrived by train late in the evening, randomly poked at a cluster of hotels on the map, and asked a tuk-tuk driver to take me there. Many hotels here, like in other cities, have no signs and are combined with clubs/bars. I checked into the first one I came across, because I had no strength at all. The hotel was just awful - the water didn't work at all, and in the first room they gave me, the sockets didn't work either. At least I had my own unlimited Wi-Fi.

Let's start with the Piassa area (from the Italian Piazza - "square"). In this part of the city, the old architecture of the late 19th century was preserved the longest, but they say that by the beginning of 2024 it was finally demolished. They've already managed to re-lay some of the streets:

Addis Ababa has a metro (officially Light rail, but it seems to go on overpasses everywhere, so it's not just a tram). The metro opened in 2015, initially there were two lines, but now the system has degraded, and only one line works, since the trains broke down and were not repaired in time. And on that one line, trains leave every 20-30 minutes. I went to the final station, and at first we stood in a long line in front of the platform. But when the train pulled up, everyone quickly ran inside.
