<h1>Russia: Zaraysk</h1>
<i>25 July 2012</i>
<h2>Zaraysk</h2>
<p>
Zaraysk is a city of emotional appeals.
<i>Gentlemen! Please don't leave your trash behind, the trash cans are near! Don't make a shithole out of your home town! We live in this town and our children will live here! Love Zaraysk and be proud of it! We are a great nation, we are not pigs! Thanks for understanding!</i>

<p>
The streets are actually quite clean.

<p>
There are untouched meadows in the Zaraysk Kremlin. The gates are not closed, people come here as if they were entering a park. When will they do this in the Moscow Kremlin?

<p>
There is also parking for bicycles in the Kremlin.

Several cats live here. One of them was clearly not averse to selling herself to the State Department and happily rubbed herself against my backpack.

In some places the landscapes are reminiscent of Suzdal.

But still, most of the houses in the center here are not private, but belong to several families. Here, for example, is the entrance to a small two-story house, apparently, entry is free, which means different people live on the floors.

But in this house, part of the walls were lined with brick, and part remained wooden.

<p>
A little further away, completely idyllic landscapes begin.

Let's look into another courtyard.

<p>
Even further from the center, impenetrable jungle begins. The streets are narrow and winding.

<p>
The water in the river is clean. Nobody swims because the beach is not equipped.

<p>
In Zaraysk, house number signs are mostly Soviet black and white, but they also have the street name written in small letters.

Newlyweds hang locks on a bridge near a spring. There is plenty of space on the railings, but some people use the space under the bridge.

<p>
Near the spring there is a striking sign in three directions, on which nothing is written.

<p>
The announcement was repeated seven times for those who were particularly dull. Or maybe this is a subtle advertisement for a photocopy service for 5 rubles?

<p>
A car service center made swans out of tires for advertising.

When I left, I didn’t have the slightest reason to feel like a mongrel, a bastard or a pig. The city is great.
<i>The sign says: Gentlemen! Don't leave trash, don't make a dump out of your city! It's our city, we and our children are going to live here. Love Zaraysk, be proud! Don't be mongrels, bastards and pigs! Thanks for understanding!</i>

<h2>Lukhovitsy</h2>
Two main attractions of the city are here. The cucumber monument, which turned out to be quite small.

<p>
And poems on the banner. <i>Russia has three capitals: Moscow, Ryazan and Lukhovitsy</i>

I can leave with peace of mind
