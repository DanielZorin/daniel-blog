<h1>Turkey: Istanbul, Kayseri, Göreme, Nevşehir</h1>
<i>12-19, 25-26 December 2021</i>
<h2>Istanbul</h2>
<p>
I explored Istanbul in some detail in 2014, but 8 years have passed since then, a lot has changed, and <a href="../istanbul">the post</a> in my style at that time came out quite short. Istanbul was a very expensive city then, but in 2021 it is quite cheap. I lived in Sultanahmet, in the very center, closer to the attractions, although probably if I come again, I will choose something in the Taksim area, like in 2014, purely to make it easier to find food that is not overpriced.

By the way, Istanbul was officially called Constantinople until the 1930s. The name "Istanbul" existed before the conquest of the city by the Turks and comes from the Greek words "to the city."

Last time I sailed along the Bosphorus on ferries, and now I had the time and desire to go on a small “cruise”. Such cruises cost pennies, approximately 2-4 dollars depending on the route. I start in the area of ​​the Galata Bridge.

One of the main attractions of Istanbul outside the center are the fortress walls that once protected Constantinople from enemies. Constantinople was a really big city, even now it’s about 10 stops by tram to get to the walls. However, in 1453, when the city was captured by the Turks, most of the territory inside the walls was just fields, as the city was severely depopulated as the Byzantine Empire declined, especially after the sack by the Crusaders in 1204.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51782676237_3e5955f3e7_o.jpg">

Next to the walls there is a museum "Panorama 1453".

<p>
The museum tells in detail about the fall of Byzantium. Unusually for us, the story is told from the Turkish point of view, which is very different from what is written in our school textbooks. Here are a couple of interesting perspectives on the situation.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51783491476_9b3c8de128_o.jpg">
<p>
The capture of Constantinople was in the long term a blessing for the city, since a dying city in a weak state turned into the brilliant capital of one of the greatest world powers.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51783491446_c083d72d71_o.jpg">
<p>
The situation with religious tolerance improved with the arrival of the Turks, as the Sultan abolished the Union of Florence (the actual subordination of the Orthodox Church to the Pope, which the Byzantine emperor agreed to in an attempt to gain support from the West), and the inculcation of Catholicism, which caused protests from the local population, stopped.

In Istanbul there is one very interesting area very far from the center - the Princes' Islands. These are four small islands in the Sea of ​​Marmara, not far from the Asian coast, consisting of old villas, a sort of mini-resort in a metropolis. You can get there directly from the center, but ferries rarely run, the schedule is constantly changing, and you can’t rely on it, and it takes an hour and a half to sail. It is more convenient to take the Marmaray train to the pier in the Asian part, from which the trip is less than 30 minutes, and ferries run every hour. Well, to make it more interesting, I didn’t immediately take the train in the European part, but first moved to the Asian part by ferry to see one of the main local areas - Kadikoy.

<h2>Kayseri</h2>
<p>
I flew to the city of Kayseri to visit the famous Cappadocia. It takes about two hours by bus from Kayseri; usually no one stays in this city, but I, of course, did not fail to explore it, especially since it was the first non-capital city on this trip. Kayseri has almost a million inhabitants, in the top ten largest Turkish cities. The name, surprisingly, actually comes from the word Kaiser/Caesar, since it was once the Roman city of Caesarea.

Armenian Church. It is surprising that it exists, since most Armenian churches were destroyed during the 1915 genocide, especially those far from the eastern regions. Now there is a library in this church.

If you look at the map, it is easy to see the outlines of the historical center, as in any old European city that was surrounded by fortified walls - now it is limited by three major streets. But the center looks something like this:

<h2>Göreme</h2>
<p>
Somehow it happened that it is in Cappadocia, and not anywhere else in the world, that you can easily fly in a hot air balloon. Usually you can fly in hot air balloons either at some festivals, or far from the city in splendid isolation, but here things are streamlined, there are a lot of tourists, therefore there are a lot of balloons at once, and the most beautiful landscapes below.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51784131864_cb8717cedc_o.jpg">

<p>
A hot air balloon flight costs approximately 60 euros. All the balloons take off near Göreme (the main city of Cappadocia, with the most hotels) early in the morning at dawn, some a little earlier, some a little later, thanks to this an epic picture is created with a large number of balloons.

The fog is falling, we made it in time. In general, in winter there is quite a big risk that flights will be canceled due to the weather, so it is better to budget 3-4 days in Cappadocia and book the flight for the very first one.

In the historical center there is a huge underground city on a hill. These are many dwellings made right in the rocks. Some go outside, but some may be deep in the hill without windows.

<h2>Uçhisar</h2>
<p>
3-4 kilometers south of Göreme is the town of Uçhisar, approximately halfway to Nevşehir. It is similar in architecture to Göreme, but more residential rather than touristy. Uçhisar is located on a hill, after which the road sharply descends into the valley to Goreme, so this is where the widest panoramic views are.
