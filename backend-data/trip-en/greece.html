<h1>Greece: Corfu, Ioannina, Meteora, Athens, Rhodes</h1>
<i>25-27 October, 29 October - 4 November 2016</i>
<h2>Corfu</h2>
<p>
I was in Greece in 1997, at the age of 7. But this doesn’t count, so I traveled like the first time. Wishing to see different parts of the country, I started the route from the western edge - the island of Corfu. This is the most “non-Greek” part of Greece, because while Greece was under Turkish rule for 400 years (from the 15th to the 19th centuries), Corfu belonged to Venice from the 13th century until its division between Napoleonic France and Austria, and after the war for another 40 years managed to be a possession of England. Therefore, Corfu in terms of architecture has more in common with the coastal cities of <a href="../croatia">Croatia</a> and <a href="../slovenia">Slovenia</a>, although the main language here has always been Greek.

<p>
The main city of Corfu (aka Kerkyra) is all like this, in soft pink and yellow tones.

The narrow streets are a bit reminiscent of <a href="../milan">Genoa</a>.

There is a huge Venetian fortress near the seashore.

I caught some kind of small celebration. People danced all sorts of dances in traditional costumes.
<p/>

<p>
It seems that this is sirtaki. Interestingly, this dance was invented in the second half of the 20th century for a Hollywood film.

<p>
The old town is full of tourists and souvenir shops. There are signs in Russian: they are selling fur coats. For some reason, in Russia it is believed that Greece has good fur coats. It’s unclear why the Greeks started making fur coats in the first place; not only do people in Europe generally not appreciate this type of clothing because it’s not environmentally friendly, but in Greece no one needs them because of the warm climate.

<p>
But here is a purely Asian place - a pool with fish, where you can put your feet so that they bite your skin. There are these in all night markets in Cambodia, and in Corfu too.

<p>
Corfu airport is very close to the city, upon arrival I even walked to the center. Behind the landing strip there is a bay above which there is a low concrete dam from which you can watch the planes. Though, they don’t land very often, you’ll have to wait a long time.

<p>
I checked into a hotel in the town of Benitses, about 10 kilometers from Corfu town. The fact is that in the center of Corfu hotels are always expensive, and Benitses is a resort village where November is low season and housing costs pennies.
<p/>

Although some even swam in the sea, mostly Russians.

For some reason, there are a lot of abandoned buildings in this one of the main resort villages of Corfu.

As in Thailand and Cambodia, in Greece small altars are placed along the roads, only here they are Orthodox and have the shape of a church.

<h2>Ioannina</h2>
<p>
Greece is primarily a country of beach holidays; cities on the mainland (except Athens and Thessaloniki) are quite rarely visited, and especially the Epirus region on the border with Albania. The ancient Greeks almost did not explore it due to the colder climate. The city of Ioannina appeared on the borders of Byzantium only at the end of the 9th century, but Epirus was soon captured by the Crusaders, then the Venetians, and returned to Byzantium only briefly in the 14th century, soon passing to the Serbs, and then to the Turks, who held it until the Balkan Wars of 1913 of the year.
<p/>

<p>
In Ioannina, the walls around the entire central part of the city are well preserved.

<h2>Meteora</h2>
<p>
Exactly between Ioannina, Athens and Thessaloniki are the Meteora monasteries - the main attraction of Greece. The nearest town is called Kalambaka, from there you can walk to the monasteries. From the photographs it seems that they are standing on the tops of steep cliffs, like in <a href="../luoyang">Zhangjiajie</a>, but in fact on the other side the cliff is far from being so steep, there is a road.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255706832_2063606512_h.jpg"/>
<p>
First you need to go from Kalambaka to the village of Kastraki, the last one before the ascent.
<p/>

<p>
Along the way, the first monastery is Nikolaos Anapavsas. It stands separately from the others; a staircase in this rock leads to it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256435531_93b57b9b9b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I’m moving towards the main monastery of the Great Meteor. You can walk along the road, but it's faster through the forest.

The climb is not very long, about 30-40 minutes. Leads almost immediately to the Great Meteor.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256635388_3b2208d2dd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Entrance to each monastery costs 3 euros. On each day, one of the six is ​​closed to visitors (each has its own day off). I went inside the Great Meteor.
<p/>

<h2>Athens</h2>
<p>
Athens sounds interesting, but in reality it is one of the most uninteresting and unattractive capitals in Europe. If in <a href="../rome">Rome</a> in addition to the Colosseum and other ruins of Ancient Rome there is a lot of stuff built in later eras, then in Athens there is nothing to see except the ruins of the Acropolis: since ancient Greece times, the city fell into disrepair, and in the 19th century it was a village of 4,000 people, where the capital of newly independent Greece was moved as a sign of continuity. As a result, most of the city is built up with monotonous white cubes covered with ugly graffiti. One day is enough to explore this capital.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255109492_46cdac5fc9_h.jpg"/>

<p>
The ancient city center was located on a high cliff, dramatic. Now it is a museum. The Parthenon can be seen from afar.
<p/>

At the foot of the Acropolis was the main square of the Agora, and, in general, most of the ancient city. Large chunks of the excavations now lie between modern shopping streets. Walking along the perimeter, you can basically see everything, even better than at the Forum of Rome, which is less tightly integrated into the modern city.

<h2>Rhodes</h2>
<p>
The trip began on the western edge in Corfu and ended on the eastern edge - on the island of Rhodes. This island became part of modern Greece later than all others: since it is near the coast of Turkey, it had the largest Muslim population and a naval base, the war for Greek independence did not reach here. In 1912, Rhodes passed to Italy after Turkey's defeat in the Italo-Turkish War, and was Italian until the end of World War II, after that the British handed it over to Greece.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255959012_91e0a5f1af_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Before the capture of the island by the Turks at the beginning of the 16th century, the Order of Hospitallers was based here, which later moved to <a href="../malta">Malta</a> and became <a href="../smom">Maltese</a>. Fortifications have been here since those times, and the city of Rhodes is probably one of the largest and best preserved fortresses I have seen in Europe.
