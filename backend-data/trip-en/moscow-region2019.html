<h1>Russia: Lyubertsy, Odintsovo, Khimki, Pushkino</h1>
<i>26 August, 26 December 2019, 4, 6 January 2020</i>
<h2>Lyubertsy</h2>
<p>
The city of Lyubertsy is adjacent to Moscow from the southeast. Traditionally considered one of the worst suburbs, in the 80s "Lubers" were synonymous with scum/gopniks. But those days are long gone; now it is a completely ordinary city in the Moscow region. Now the easiest way to get to Lyubertsy is by metro, since Kotelniki station on the purple line is located right on the border.

<p>
The center of Lyubertsy, however, is quite far from the metro and closer to the train station, so you still need to walk through residential areas.

<h2>Odintsovo</h2>
<p>
In November 2019, two lines of the MCD, the Moscow city train, opened. Trains began to run on existing electric train lines without breaks at short intervals, and it became possible to pay with a Troika card. If previously most trains to Krasnogorsk went from Rizhsky station, and only a few from Podolsk, now all MCD trains pass through the whole of Moscow. I was in Krasnogorsk and Podolsk, so I went along the MCD-1 route to the city of Odintsovo, adjacent to Moscow from the west, to get acquainted with the MCD.

Since the MCD coincides with the Aeroexpress route to Sheremetyevo, some trains from Odintsovo go not to Lobnya, but to the airport, turning into an Aeroexpress after the Belorussky station.

<p>
Of all the cities neighboring Moscow, Odintsovo is the most prestigious and expensive in terms of housing. Probably, the proximity of Rublyovka, Barvikha and other VIP villages, which belong to the administrative territory of the city of Odintsovo, has an effect.

This station is located in the village of Vnukovo, not very close to the airport of the same name. On the other side of the railway behind the Minsk highway there will be Odintsovo, but I went to the village of Vnukovo, where there is actually a normal exit. Like this:

<h2>Khimki</h2>
<p>
The city of Khimki is located north of Moscow. All Muscovites have seen it many times on the way to the IKEA store or to Sheremetyevo airport; the Leningradskoye Highway passes through Khimki, until recently it was the main road to St. Petersburg, and was constantly stuck in traffic jams. Along the highway in Khimki there are mostly large shopping centers, and the city itself is a few hundred meters further.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257309580_670d204367_o.jpg">
<p>
The historical part of Khimki is located east of the Leningradskoye Highway, very close to the Moscow Ring Road. Almost immediately beyond the Moscow Ring Road there is the Khimki Arena, from which the central park begins.

I went to the northern part of Khimki, where there is another monument to Lenin, but I took the wrong turn and ended up in a complete hole. All around were rickety rotten wooden houses and impassable dirt, as if I had driven into a village. The most interesting thing is that this is not even Khimki, but Moscow itself.

This is the Molzhaninovsky district, which, together with neighboring Kurkino, forms a kind of outgrowth beyond the Moscow Ring Road in the northern part of Moscow.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256467113_024ea5c352_o.jpg">
<p>
Molzhaninovsky district is the area with the smallest population and the lowest density (in terms of area it is in the top 5). This is also the only area where there are no hospitals, entertainment centers, post office, banks (only one ATM) and public transport.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256269091_9c3aa5217f_o.jpg">
<p>
It’s interesting that in the early 90s, Sheremetyevo Airport was annexed to the Molzhaninovsky District, which was de jure illegal. On many old maps of Moscow, the exclave Sheremetyevo is visible next to the outgrowth of the Molzhaninovsky district. But in fact, the airport has always been in Khimki, and in the 2010s the conflict was eliminated, and the airport finally remained in the region.

<h2>Pushkino</h2>
<p>
One not very pleasant winter day, I got into the car and drove to the city of Pushkino, located outside Mytishchi. This was my first time going on a relatively long trip (not in my area) by car alone, the goal was to practice before traveling to the USA and evaluate the pitfalls. It turned out that it is not easy to drive through unfamiliar territory when the navigator is only on your phone, and there is no one to correct it. A couple of times I drove past the necessary turns, and then drove into a street that ended in a dead end, but the navigator thought otherwise. This street was also a hockey field.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257714720_2ee7a31b1c_o.jpg">

It happened in the Mamontovka microdistrict of the city of Pushkino, which mostly consists of private houses.

I went into these wilds for a reason, because, in addition to Pushkino, I also wanted to see the village of Akulovo. This unusual place is a tiny exclave of Moscow in the Moscow region. Akulovo belongs to the Eastern Administrative Okrug (although geographically closer to the North-eastern one, which is still 13 kilometers in a straight line), to an area also called Vostochny (Eastern). This area consists of two exclaves - in addition to Akulovo, there is also the village of Vostochny in the Vostochny district of the Eastern Administrative Okrug. These two villages are needed to service the beginning and end of the Eastern Water Canal. The village is not closed, you can come there freely. There is public transport from the city of Pushkino. I parked at the local school. The three nine-story buildings ahead are not included in Akulovo, although they are located directly next to it. It’s probably a pity for their residents to be without Moscow registration.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255944092_7c16978ea1_o.jpg">
<p>
But the school itself is part of Akulovo! It turns out that Akulovo consists of a main exclave and a mini-exclave along the borders of the school yard.
