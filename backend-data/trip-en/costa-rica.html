<h1>Costa Rica: Liberia, La Fortuna, San Jose, Cartago, Heredia, Alajuela, Limon, Puntarenas, Quepos</h1>
<i>31 October - 5 November 2021</i>
<h2>Liberia</h2>
<p>
Crossing the border, I found myself in Costa Rica, the most popular country in Central America. My plan was to go first to the Arenal volcano, and then further south to San Jose. According to the schedule, there are two buses from the border directly to my destination, at 6-30 in the morning and in the afternoon. Since the Nicaraguan border guards were interrogating me again, I left the border at 6:40 and was waiting for a bus to the nearest city of Liberia, when at 7:00 the bus I needed to San Carlos passed me, and I did not have time to react to it. I wasn’t going to wait half a day at the border; instead, I decided to try a route with three transfers, which was recommended by the website with schedules: border - Liberia - Cañas - Tilaran - La Fortuna. The first two sections did not promise any difficulties, as they go along the main highway (Pan American).

<p>
The northwestern corner of Costa Rica is called Guanacaste, a relatively flat region.

<p>
There are abandoned cars along the roads here.

<p>
The town of La Cruz near the highway, as usual, with the name of the town in the square.

<p>
Liberia is the second largest city in Costa Rica, if you count all the cities adjacent to the capital as one large city. But Liberia's population is only 35 thousand.

<p>
After previous poor countries it looks civilized.

<p>
It was Sunday, the streets were empty.
<p/>

All shops are closed.

<p>
Name of the city and church. In Costa Rica, churches are often not of classical architecture, like in Brazil.
<p/>

<p>
I bought a SIM card and went to the next city, Cañas. Pan Americana Overpass:

<p>
Bus station. Buses to Tilaran go quite often, even on Sundays about once every hour and a half. In Costa Rica the buses are like this, not the American school buses like in previous countries.

<p>
The most dubious section was the last one, since buses from Tilaran only go once a day, but it turned out that the schedule was slightly changed and a second bus was added, so I was on time. At the station, the old announcement is laconic: “The 9:30 bus is cancelled. Reason: COVID-19.”
<p/>

At the pick-up they offer to get the Pfizer vaccine.

Tilaran is already in a hilly area. Near the town there is a hill with a cross on top.

<h2>La Fortuna</h2>
<p>
The road from Tilaran to La Fortuna is very beautiful, as it goes around half of Lake Arenal.
<p/>

At the beginning of the 21st century, this volcano was very popular as it was possible to watch the eruption, but it ended about 10 years ago.

In Costa Rica, it’s a real treat to the eye when you drive - all the villages and towns are very well-groomed, there are flowers and hedges everywhere.

<h2>San Jose</h2>
<p>
The capital of Costa Rica is criticized by many, but it seems that the matter is in the experience. Coming from Panama, San Jose will seem much worse. But if you come from the north like I did, the city will seem just great. It’s quite civilized here and quite safe, I even walked the streets in the evening, which is definitely not something you should do in Honduras and El Salvador.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51736351544_c793bd0179_h.jpg"/>

<p>
The area with hotels north of the central square is still considered slightly unsafe. There really are homeless people asking for cigarettes on the corners.
<p/>

There is some architectural beauty in San Jose too. Here is the post office building.

<h2>Cartago</h2>
<p>
Four cities are located closely in the metropolitan valley: San José, Alajuela, Cartago and Heredia. Each of these cities is also the capital of a province, which includes a large area far from the capital. Cartago is the historical capital of Costa Rica, and the guidebook promised some architecture. Between San Jose and Cartago there are residential one-story areas.

There really isn't a lot of colonial architecture in Cartago, about the same as in San José and Alajuela.

The ruins of the Spanish cathedral remain in the central square, apparently this is what distinguishes Cartago from neighboring cities.

<h2>Heredia</h2>
<p>
The city of Heredia is located between San Jose and Alajuela. I went there mainly to say I visited all the provinces of Costa Rica, since it only takes about 30 minutes to get there along the way. At the same time, I tried out a train in Costa Rica - almost the only passenger railway in Central America.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51736590980_83b0e76e6b_h.jpg"/>

<p>
The train looks like this. The fare is less than a dollar.

<h2>Alajuela</h2>
<p>
Alajuela is a neighboring city to San Jose and has the airport. The province of Alajuela includes the entire northern central part of the country, including the Arenal volcano, which I had already visited. And also near Alajuela there is one of the most easily accessible national parks in the country - Poas Volcano.

It turned out that the bus to Poas National Park runs once a day only on weekends, so I had to take a taxi, and the ride there was about 20 kilometers, so I paid 40 dollars for the trip there and back according to the meter. You need to buy a ticket to the park in advance on the website for a certain time, but if you arrive earlier, there is no need to wait - no one inside is watching, although tourists are allowed to the volcano in groups, one at a time, every 15 minutes. They even give out helmets to wear when going to the volcano.

<h2>Limon</h2>
<p>
In Costa Rica, I visited the shores of both oceans for the first time. The Caribbean coast, like Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala, was not particularly colonized by the Spanish, and was settled mainly from the Caribbean islands. Until the mid-20th century, residents of the Caribbean region were not even allowed to move freely to the rest of Costa Rica. Only at the end of the 19th century a railroad was built from San Jose to the coast to access the Atlantic. The road ended in the city of Puerto Limon. The road there descends from the mountains into the jungle.
<p/>

The journey took much longer than I expected due to traffic jams and constant repairs in different areas.

After San Jose and Limon, I went to the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. The largest city and capital of the province is called Puntarenas.

Puntarenas has a very unusual shape. It stands on a very long (5 kilometers) and very narrow (500 meters) straight peninsula. When looking at the map, I first thought that this was some kind of artificial peninsula, because it was very smooth, but it was too large to be artificial.
<p/>

Unfortunately, at the border I was given only 7 days to stay in Costa Rica, and I didn’t have time to see this part. In general, there are a couple of places where tourists go, and judging by the distance from civilization, there may be really beautiful beaches there.

The clouds are gathering. On the way from the ferry terminal to the hotel, I was completely drenched in rain and had difficulty drying my boots overnight (but the next day it rained again).

In the evening I had dinner at the hotel restaurant, for less than $15 they gave me a huge plate of seafood, including even lobster.

<h2>Quepos</h2>
<p>
People come to the town of Quepos to visit Manuel Antonio National Park - one of the most popular in Costa Rica. Quepos is located next to the Pacific coast on the Pan American Highway.

From Quepos, you can take a local bus to reach in about 20 minutes the village of Manuel Antonio, which is separated from Quepos by a mountain.

Like Poas Volcano, you need to buy a ticket to Manuel Antonio National Park in advance on the website of all parks in Costa Rica, for a certain time (but no one limits you inside, you can walk as you wish). The part of the park accessible to tourists is small and can be easily explored on foot at a leisurely pace in 2-3 hours. This is a tropical forest with paths through it.
<p/>

<p>
Reminds me of Malaysia (probably because it was in this country that I walked through such forests most of all; in general, Indonesia also has something similar, and Brazil too).

Some of the paths go near the sea, there are beaches here, even relatively secluded ones (maybe because the weather was bad, there were fewer people).

While I was photographing a huge lizard from afar, I didn’t notice how another wave covered the beach and completely soaked my barely dry shoes.

Monkey. Apart from monkeys, birds and one lizard, I didn’t see any animals in the park, although in general you can see here, for example, sloths in the trees.
