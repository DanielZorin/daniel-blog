<h2>Budapest</h2>
<p>
Budapest still stands on the banks of the Danube.

I visited this city for the fifth time, thereby making Budapest equal to <a href="../bilbao">Barcelona</a>.

This time I was passing through one evening, the next day there was a flight at 6 am, i.e. I had to get up at 3 am to catch the bus. Yes, in Budapest buses run all night. Moreover, when you go to the airport, you need to change at a stop near the penultimate metro station, Hatar utca. So, in this residential area near the metro there is a stall with vegetables and fruits open around the clock!

Every time I stay in different places. This time it was a hostel for a ridiculous 4.5 euros near Calvin Square. What's great about Budapest hostels is that you can look into the courtyards that are closed from the street.

This house had a gorgeous spiral staircase.

Walked through the streets. It’s a mystery to me why sometimes in Budapest the street name is crossed out in red, and the exact same one hangs below.

For some reason, many souvenir shops like to prohibit photos.

Near the store with McLenin, which I photographed on one of my previous visits, a mannequin wearing a Guy Fawkes mask appeared.

In one of the alleys a bar with Lenin was found.

And in another alley a monument to Lenin was being sold. I saw Lenin - the day was not in vain.
