<h2>Yekaterinburg</h2>
<p>
Six years later, I came for the second time to <a href="../siberia">Yekaterinburg</a>. It turns out, again at the end of a catastrophic year - that time it was 2014, now it’s 2020.
<p/>

<p>
I stayed in an apartment hotel in the very center, from the hallway window there was such a panoramic view.

<p>
I wanted to go to the observation deck at Vysotsky, but again, like last time, I couldn’t - on the day I was going to do it, there was a blizzard and poor visibility.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256508299_fbc18192a4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Only towards evening it calmed down, but still the visibility was far from ideal as the day before.

Last time the Yeltsin Center was still under construction, but now it is open.

<p>
At the beginning of the museum they show a film about how various rulers of Russia (Catherine II, Alexander I, Alexander II, Khrushchev, Gorbachev and others) tried to liberalize the country and make it freer, but it only worked under Yeltsin.
<p/>

<p>
The museum tells about the history of the 90s, quite interestingly, although most of it was familiar to me, because I read books about this period, including from direct participants in the events. You can feel nostalgic for all sorts of artifacts.

The Iset Tower opposite the Yeltsin Center was completed in 2016. It was the northernmost skyscraper in the world before the Lakhta Center in St. Petersburg became taller.

On this trip I visited not only the center of Yekaterinburg, but also some interesting places further away. For example, on the eastern outskirts there is a nice park called Stone Tents.

It so happened that Yekaterinburg was probably the first city where I visited all the metro stations. There are still many subways whose lines I have traveled completely, but nowhere else have I gotten off at every station, and in EKB there are only 9 stations, and they all have beautiful, interesting interiors. The first station "Prospekt Kosmonavtov".

The earliest cars were very large (nowadays they would be almost limousines) and looked like carriages.

Ford Model T is the most popular car of those times. Nearly 2 million of these were produced in 1925, and they cost $260—adjusted for inflation, that's about $4,000 today.

There are three pedals already familiar to us. It turns out that the design of cars has not changed for 100 years, with the exception of the appearance of an automatic transmission.

The “workhouse” advertisement, as I understand it, is for those who find themselves in a difficult situation - without documents or dependent on drugs. They pay suspiciously a lot - it comes out to 15-22 thousand a month, including free accommodation and food, this is much higher than the average salary in this city.

<h2>Nizhny Tagil</h2>
<p>
Nizhny Tagil is an industrial city that has become a kind of meme because of the TV series “Our Russia” (itself an adaptation of "Little Britain"). There is also Verkhniy (Upper) Tagil, which is 30 times smaller than Nizhny Tagil and does not have passenger rail service, while Nizhny (Lower) Tagil is now even served by high-speed Lastochka trains.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255842827_dcd3ce54d6_h.jpg"/>

<p>
I love traveling to Nizhny Tagil.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255842837_e95d468374_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Nizhny Tagil welcomes you with public transport, represented mainly by these coffins on wheels, which you need to climb into while bending over. Previously, I had encountered such inconvenient transport only in the outback of Indonesia.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255842932_6cf6853a82_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Nizhny Tagil is quite large in area. There are many large factories here, and in Soviet times they tried to build residential areas closer to them. Therefore, there is such a layout - a factory, and next to it there is a lot of houses, it turns out to be an agglomeration of several cities. From the station I traveled 7-8 kilometers by minibus; half the way there was a forest on one side and a factory on the other. As a result, I came to Uralvagonzavod.
<p/>

<p>
Oldfags remember how in 2011 a worker from this plant promised Putin to come to Moscow to disperse the rallies. This worker was later made a plenipotentiary representative in the Ural Federal District. But those times are in the past.

<h2>Verkhoturye</h2>
<p>
The main goal of this trip to the north was the city of Verkhoturye - one of the few remaining unvisited historical cities in Russia. This is one of the oldest cities in the Urals (founded in 1598); initially, the main road to Siberia went through it.
<p/>

From Nizhny Tagil it takes three to four hours to get here by train. View along the way:
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255907448_1dcf2eb025_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Verkhoturye is a very small city, less than 10 thousand inhabitants. But the station is located just outside the city; you need to travel 7 kilometers by bus. I wanted to take a taxi (so as not to wait), but I couldn’t - I couldn’t find one. I called all the numbers that I found on the Internet, and the phones that were posted in advertisements at the bus stop, but all of them did not answer, either they no longer belonged to taxis, or they belonged to taxis in another city. About 40 minutes later the bus arrived.
