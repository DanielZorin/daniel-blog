<h2>Yekaterinburg</h2>
<p>
Six years later, I came for the second time to <a href="http://goo.gl/haaDNQ">Yekaterinburg</a>. It turns out, again at the end of a catastrophic year - that time it was 2014, now it’s 2020.
<p/>

I stayed in an apartment hotel in the very center, from the hallway window there was such a panoramic view.

I wanted to go to the observation deck at Vysotsky, but again, like last time, I couldn’t - on the day I was going to do it, there was a blizzard and poor visibility.

Only towards evening it calmed down, but still the visibility was far from ideal as the day before.

At the beginning of the museum they show a film about how various rulers of Russia (Catherine II, Alexander I, Alexander II, Khrushchev, Gorbachev and others) tried to liberalize the country and make it freer, but it only worked under Yeltsin.

The museum tells about the history of the 90s, quite interestingly, although most of it was familiar to me, because I read books about this period, including from direct participants in the events. You can feel nostalgic for all sorts of artifacts.

It so happened that Yekaterinburg was probably the first city where I visited all the metro stations. There are still many subways whose lines I have traveled completely, but nowhere else have I gotten off at every station, and in EKB there are only 9 stations, and they all have beautiful, interesting interiors. The first station "Prospekt Kosmonavtov".

The “workhouse” advertisement, as I understand it, is for those who find themselves in a difficult situation - without documents or dependent on drugs. They pay suspiciously a lot - it comes out to 15-22 thousand a month, including free accommodation and food, this is much higher than the average salary in this city.

<h2>Nizhny Tagil</h2>
<p>
Nizhny Tagil is an industrial city that has become a kind of meme because of the TV series “Our Russia” (itself an adaptation of "Little Britain"). There is also Verkhniy (Upper) Tagil, which is 30 times smaller than Nizhny Tagil and does not have passenger rail service, while Nizhny (Lower) Tagil is now even served by high-speed Lastochka trains.
<p/>

Nizhny Tagil welcomes you with public transport, represented mainly by these coffins on wheels, which you need to climb into while bending over. Previously, I had encountered such inconvenient transport only in the outback of Indonesia.

Nizhny Tagil is quite large in area. There are many large factories here, and in Soviet times they tried to build residential areas closer to them. Therefore, there is such a layout - a factory, and next to it there is a lot of houses, it turns out to be an agglomeration of several cities. From the station I traveled 7-8 kilometers by minibus; half the way there was a forest on one side and a factory on the other. As a result, I came to Uralvagonzavod.

<h2>Verkhoturye</h2>

The main goal of this trip to the north was the city of Verkhoturye - one of the few remaining unvisited historical cities in Russia. This is one of the oldest cities in the Urals (founded in 1598); initially, the main road to Siberia went through it.

<p>
Verkhoturye is a very small city, less than 10 thousand inhabitants. But the station is located just outside the city; you need to travel 7 kilometers by bus. I wanted to take a taxi (so as not to wait), but I couldn’t - I couldn’t find one. I called all the numbers that I found on the Internet, and the phones that were posted in advertisements at the bus stop, but all of them did not answer, either they no longer belonged to taxis, or they belonged to taxis in another city. About 40 minutes later the bus arrived.
