<h1>Netherlands: Maastricht</h1>
<i>2 August 2016</i>
<h2>Maastricht</h2>
<p>
Being at the junction of the borders of Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, I could not help but visit all three countries. I was in the Netherlands once before more or less thoroughly <a href="../netherlands">in 2012</a>. As soon as the bus crosses the border (and at this point the border with Germany runs through the middle of the small town), clearly recognizable Dutch architecture appears all around.

Although Maastricht is located at the very edge of the country, it is only two and a half hours by train to Amsterdam, although the ticket costs 25 euros.

Surprisingly many tourists, despite the bad weather.

The signs are duplicated in the local language - Limburgish.

In Maastricht there is a church converted into a bookshop.

<p>
This is unusual, but when you have been to many places, everything repeats itself in a circle. I quickly remembered that I had already seen a church converted into a bookstore - in <a href="../porto">Obidos</a>.

On the mailbox, everyone marks whether they want to receive advertising leaflets (on the left) and newspapers with free advertisements (on the right). Newspapers with advertisements are called huis-aan-huisbladen ("house-to-house newspaper") in Dutch.

And the chair was chained to the piano so that it wouldn’t be taken away.
