<h1>China: Chongqing, Guiyang</h1>
<i>11-17 April 2015</i>
<h2>Chongqing</h2>
<p>
I fell in love with Chongqing when I accidentally ended up there <a href="../sichuan">in 2013</a>. This is a city where old quarters that miraculously survived all the general secretaries and multi-level overpasses built right above them combine; it is a mixture of eccentric architecture and gorgeous natural landscapes. The former capital of China, the city of the most beautiful girls and the hottest food - Chongqing.

<p>
In 2013, I only saw a small part of the city - the central pedestrian area and the cable car, as well as the metro route to the airport. Now I had enough time. First, you should take a walk along the Yangtze embankment.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256222428_0dbf56f0fb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The embankment is laid out on both sides.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256222368_73f42bcf30_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On the northern shore, where the city center is, there is a long park where people play mahjong and drink tea. There is even Wi-Fi attached to the stalls.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256770579_c45ba2cb52_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This way you can reach the confluence of the Yangtze and the Jialingjiang River.
<p/>

<p>
Most tourists in Chongqing are passing through, because cruises along the Yangtze through the Three Gorges to the city of Yichang start here. It seems that these people are sent from the plane directly to the ship along with their luggage.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256770754_ca86a46c46_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Well, at least they’ll have time to look at the confluence.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256022261_7144f28623_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Skyscrapers on all sides.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256222583_e9bd005b12_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Actually the area above the confluence, on the roof of the cruise terminal.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256770834_a6e2c1941b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Behind it, a huge space has been dug up; a new Manhattan will be built there. Next time I come, I won’t recognize Chongqing.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256222648_10c1304f0f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There used to be a funicular here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256004277_5c45fb14e4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I was here, but it's hard not to be tempted to take photos.

Apple store.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256733046_25dd08ad6b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A little further is the government building.

<p>
The southern side of the Yangtze is also worth a visit, if only for the view of the center. You can also take a ride on the cable car.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256772924_736b6c00e7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here are those “golden Petronas Towers” up close.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257775815_92d3621208_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It's actually the Sheraton Hotel with the golden lions.
<p/>

<p>
The Chinese believe that Chongqing has the most beauties. This is a monument to commemorate this fact.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256225143_a83e428811_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You should definitely visit the south coast in the evening.
<p/>

<p>
Truly it is written here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256225108_2a937adfb9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here is what I like.
<p/>

<p>
A cottage community somewhere on the outskirts.

<p>
When you take the metro towards the airport, at some point you pass a block built in a “European” style. In 2013 I photographed it from the window, but this time I arrived by train and found myself right in it. It took two hours to unsuccessfully try to find a hotel. There are a huge number of hotels there, but alas, they have agreed not to accommodate foreigners anywhere - a traditional problem of large cities. But in the process of searching, I discovered that you can go into one of the high-rise buildings and just take the elevator to the top, and there:
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256223753_0752bf504d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Chongqing North Station.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255293302_ede2f89e66_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This building has one corridor across the entire floor, with entrances to all apartments.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257478619_6cd89f8b30_h.jpg"/>
<p>
View of the courtyard.
<p/>

<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257067030_b99711cdba_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Crossroads.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256223818_cb1f19c7b4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The quarter looks unusual for China, but at the same time it is very lively. In the evening, when it gets cooler, there are fruit carts at all intersections, and all the first floors are filled with restaurants.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256223878_17e2ce442a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Absolutely Chinese atmosphere. People eat hot pot.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256223843_2cc468e535_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Hot pot is the most famous Chongqing dish. This is when you get a soup and cook whatever you want in it. Typical Chongqing very spicy soup is on the right, on the left is an ordinary fish soup.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257068550_864937ffba_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The range of ingredients is large. To avoid it being spicy, you need to dip it in oil.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255294762_1ff8ed6226_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Menu and my order. All the fun cost about 60 yuan.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257775970_ecf3f17baa_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In Chongqing, there are still traditional porters who carry things on a bamboo stick.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256022211_d1945ea2f8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
However, they also use backpacks here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256222738_4e083a6800_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is even a monument to the backpack.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257066175_a57c75a04d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Why do they make bars on balconies in China? To store all kinds of rubbish.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256022216_83d91f5bbf_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Monument to Winnie the Pooh.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256222663_8a6063da7b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Salon. I got a great haircut here for 26 yuan ($4).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257066270_2c4c71335a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are also hot springs in Chongqing! Though most of them are in expensive hotels, and the entry there is expensive, but if you go to the “southern hot spring”, then it will be inexpensive.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255294792_354f0872c7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The place is colorful.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257068590_dc00d7f02b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A great way to relax.

<p>
Chongqing is famous for its cosmic transport interchanges. If you want to look at a fantastic city of the future, then this is the place for you. Unlike, for example, Moscow, where large interchanges are located on the Moscow Ring Road far from the main residential area, in Chongqing overpasses can run directly between houses and end up in a tunnel under a hill.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257067790_f9569c8670_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This place is located near the main station.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256770439_948812446f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Another cool place is located very close to the central square and the liberation monument. On the southern slope.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255292567_8921657548_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is a long pedestrian crossing on very high columns
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257478384_284da6a5f5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It leads to one of the floors of an ordinary residential building.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256933623_720e9a66f1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It must be inspiring to leave such a house for work.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256023981_72ae7a647d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The metro also runs on overpasses in many places. At the junction above, by the way, there is also a metro bridge.
<p/>

<p>
Another interchange. This is away from the center, east of the arrow.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257066290_1119470786_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In general, almost any large bridge will have a similar interchange, the main difficulty is to get there closer on foot.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256022576_ea3442668d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Let's move on to the bridges. There are many bridges and they are varied.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255292292_0415e0103b_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>

<p>
There is a cable car nearby. In 2013 I looked from above, and now - from below.
<p/>

<p>
A metro bridge, and under it some vegetable gardens.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255291982_a6269c4901_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Some people even drive on these islands by car.
<p/>

At night.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255291907_eee8d66042_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Finally, the oldest bridge across the Yangtze, built under Mao.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257065575_b17027124d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are even sculptures in the style of socialist realism along the edges.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256933933_c03fb45131_h.jpg"/>
<p>
By the way, there is also an interchange under the bridge.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256024751_97b8818995_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It’s worth walking across this bridge; from there you have a gorgeous view of the entire city center.
<p/>

<p>
Chongqing may seem like a city of skyscrapers, but in fact there are a surprising number of old neighborhoods preserved between the skyscrapers. For example, near the station. I lived here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257477889_a948b867e6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Old neighborhoods remain along the hillsides. There are winding staircases along them.
<p/>

Strengthening the slope.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257065795_80dfa3fe69_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also a full-fledged “old city” in Chongqing; it is quite far from the modern center. Everything is in the best Chinese traditions: there are a lot of souvenir shops.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256023521_b4db2d9725_h.jpg"/>
<p>

We have to go up.

<p/>

<p>
In every block there is a sign with the photo and phone number of the local police officer, and even a QQ number (a Chinese application like ICQ).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255293602_0ef6e97217_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Finally, we climb to the very top.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255293637_713f0199a3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And there...
<p/>

<p>
Vegetable gardens.
<p/>

<p>
Lots of confusing passages and stairs.

In China, graffiti on the scale that exists in, say, London is prohibited. Maybe some blank wall in the yard is painted, and the walls of kindergartens are painted with cartoon characters. But there is one place in Chongqing where graffiti is allowed, and all the houses there are painted. This is the neighborhood around the local arts university.

How to find this place? Here is a landmark: this is what the area is called. If you type into Baidu map, it will show the correct location, south of Chongqing South Railway Station.

There is an amusement park in Chongqing called "Foreigners Street" (Yangrenjie). This is a real kingdom of kitsch and trashy architecture. A sort of <a href="../kazan">Yoshkar-Ola</a> in miniature.
<p/>

At the entrance you are greeted by a crowd of girls with balloons.

In the background, a new bridge is being built over the Yangtze.

From above there is a panoramic view of this building. This is the world's largest public toilet.

I've never seen a Gaudí style toilet.

It's not very comfortable from the inside.

Just some kind of Park Guell.

<p>
Go ahead. There is a mountain with the inscription Love. There were once plans to make a sex-themed park here (like Love Land in South Korea), but the public was outraged and the project was closed.
<p/>

<p>
There is a wooden church on the hill.

I didn’t understand what they wanted to write above the entrance.

The interior of this church would give any Russian orthodox a shock.

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256223668_0c156df76e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Among all this kitsch stands a building that looks like a German or Scandinavian church.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256223538_2f688d0033_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is really a church, there aren't even flashy posters or attractions inside. But amid the surrounding madness, it looks like postmodern banter at kitsch. Really, the Chinese have nothing sacred.

<h2>Guiyang</h2>
<p>
Guiyang is the capital of Guizhou Province. The province is bad by Chinese standards, one of the last places in terms of salaries. If you wish, you can find something to see in this region. There are many mountains, beautiful scenery and several old towns, but all this can also be found in the neighboring regions of Hunan and Guangxi, and it is more accessible and cheaper there because it is not so far to travel. That’s why Guizhou province ended in Guiyang for me.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257199230_36ab3a0398_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Guiyang is immediately greeting with chaos. The station square is in complete chaos.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256903994_ce7ecd5740_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Cars, buses - all in one pile.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256155781_ae4d94a4a8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The station is located on a hill, right from there you can go down one floor, and there will be an area with cheap canteens and hotels. Guiyang is the first city in China where I saw prostitutes standing openly on the street (the second would be Shanghai).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256355428_8a69f2b83f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is an interesting self-service dining format here: for only 10 yuan!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256903894_98eed83c09_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You throw whatever you can in your plate. Not much meat - a lot of fat and bones. Everything is very spicy. But it's 10 yuan.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256903964_67fdc475f9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In general, the main feature of Guiyang turned out to be that for some reason everything here is very expensive. Maybe because the first hieroglyph in the name of the city means “expensive”? Pineapples on a stick cost 5 yuan, although throughout the country they cost 2, maximum 3 yuan.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256904494_a4300b372e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are also traffic jams here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256904379_fddb976433_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Stickers on the asphalt are suddenly not advertising prostitutes.
<p/>

<p>
Among the attractions there is a good embankment.

<p>
Everywhere in China they dance in parks, and in Guiyang they sing. When you stand between two pavilions with singers, you hear a cacophony.

Pavilion. Oddly enough, entry inside is free.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256904229_9b0df08bb3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Having nothing better to do, we arranged a photo shoot on these pretentious antique chairs. There are tourists in Guiyang, however, what they do there is unclear, but they are taken on an excursion to the pavilion.

There is a monument to Mao Zedong in the central square. Long time no see!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257494489_835f0a27f6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
To make it less boring, they placed a golden flying saucer in front of Mao.
<p/>

<p>
And that’s basically all I can say about Guiyang.
