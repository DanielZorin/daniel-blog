<h1>China: Chongqing, Guiyang</h1>
<i>11-17 April 2015</i>
<h2>Chongqing</h2>
<p>
I fell in love with Chongqing when I accidentally ended up there <a href="../sichuan">in 2013</a>. This is a city where old quarters that miraculously survived all the general secretaries and multi-level overpasses built right above them combine; it is a mixture of eccentric architecture and gorgeous natural landscapes. The former capital of China, the city of the most beautiful girls and the hottest food - Chongqing.

<p>
In 2013, I only saw a small part of the city - the central pedestrian area and the cable car, as well as the metro route to the airport. Now I had enough time. First, you should take a walk along the Yangtze embankment.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256222428_aaf75c66cc_o.jpg">
<p>
The embankment is laid out on both sides.
<p/>

<p>
On the northern shore, where the city center is, there is a long park where people play mahjong and drink tea. There is even Wi-Fi attached to the stalls.
<p/>

<p>
This way you can reach the confluence of the Yangtze and the Jialingjiang River.
<p/>

<p>
Most tourists in Chongqing are passing through, because cruises along the Yangtze through the Three Gorges to the city of Yichang start here. It seems that these people are sent from the plane directly to the ship along with their luggage.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256770754_c51eed3a24_o.jpg">
<p>
Well, at least they’ll have time to look at the confluence.
<p/>

Skyscrapers on all sides.

<p>
Actually the area above the confluence, on the roof of the cruise terminal.

<p>
Behind it, a huge space has been dug up; a new Manhattan will be built there. Next time I come, I won’t recognize Chongqing.
<p/>

There used to be a funicular here.

I was here, but it's hard not to be tempted to take photos.

A little further is the government building.

<p>
The southern side of the Yangtze is also worth a visit, if only for the view of the center. You can also take a ride on the cable car.
<p/>

<p/>

It's actually the Sheraton Hotel with the golden lions.

The Chinese believe that Chongqing has the most beauties. This is a monument to commemorate this fact.
<p/>

You should definitely visit the south coast in the evening.

<p>
When you take the metro towards the airport, at some point you pass a block built in a “European” style. In 2013 I photographed it from the window, but this time I arrived by train and found myself right in it. It took two hours to unsuccessfully try to find a hotel. There are a huge number of hotels there, but alas, they have agreed not to accommodate foreigners anywhere - a traditional problem of large cities. But in the process of searching, I discovered that you can go into one of the high-rise buildings and just take the elevator to the top, and there:
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256223753_368536814f_o.jpg">
<p>
Chongqing North Station.

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255293302_eb019b9272_o.jpg">
<p>
This building has one corridor across the entire floor, with entrances to all apartments.

<p>
Crossroads.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256223818_abb2afd391_o.jpg">
<p>
The quarter looks unusual for China, but at the same time it is very lively. In the evening, when it gets cooler, there are fruit carts at all intersections, and all the first floors are filled with restaurants.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256223878_473df8bc97_o.jpg">
<p>
Absolutely Chinese atmosphere. People eat hot pot.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256223843_6dc891e82f_o.jpg">
<p>
Hot pot is the most famous Chongqing dish. This is when you get a soup and cook whatever you want in it. Typical Chongqing very spicy soup is on the right, on the left is an ordinary fish soup.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257068550_7189dd40b6_o.jpg">
<p>
The range of ingredients is large. To avoid it being spicy, you need to dip it in oil.
<p/>

<p>
Menu and my order. All the fun cost about 60 yuan.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257775970_c8c8933ca3_o.jpg">
<p>
In Chongqing, there are still traditional porters who carry things on a bamboo stick.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256022211_66cff2e5aa_o.jpg">
<p>
However, they also use backpacks here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256222738_957c105b7a_o.jpg">
<p>
There is even a monument to the backpack.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257066175_3efa0a822b_o.jpg">
<p>
Why do they make bars on balconies in China? To store all kinds of rubbish.
<p/>

<p/>

<p>
There are also hot springs in Chongqing! Though most of them are in expensive hotels, and the entry there is expensive, but if you go to the “southern hot spring”, then it will be inexpensive.
<p/>

<p>
The place is colorful.

Chongqing is famous for its cosmic transport interchanges. If you want to look at a fantastic city of the future, then this is the place for you. Unlike, for example, Moscow, where large interchanges are located on the Moscow Ring Road far from the main residential area, in Chongqing overpasses can run directly between houses and end up in a tunnel under a hill.

<p>
Another cool place is located very close to the central square and the liberation monument. On the southern slope.
<p/>

This is a long pedestrian crossing on very high columns
<p/>

<p>
It leads to one of the floors of an ordinary residential building.

It must be inspiring to leave such a house for work.
<p/>

<p>
The metro also runs on overpasses in many places. At the junction above, by the way, there is also a metro bridge.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257066290_5679937bd7_o.jpg">
<p>
In general, almost any large bridge will have a similar interchange, the main difficulty is to get there closer on foot.

Let's move on to the bridges. There are many bridges and they are varied.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257065575_93e4e4e524_o.jpg">

There are even sculptures in the style of socialist realism along the edges.

<p>
It’s worth walking across this bridge; from there you have a gorgeous view of the entire city center.

Chongqing may seem like a city of skyscrapers, but in fact there are a surprising number of old neighborhoods preserved between the skyscrapers. For example, near the station. I lived here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257477889_1f1b851c07_o.jpg">
<p>
Old neighborhoods remain along the hillsides. There are winding staircases along them.

There is also a full-fledged “old city” in Chongqing; it is quite far from the modern center. Everything is in the best Chinese traditions: there are a lot of souvenir shops.

In China, graffiti on the scale that exists in, say, London is prohibited. Maybe some blank wall in the yard is painted, and the walls of kindergartens are painted with cartoon characters. But there is one place in Chongqing where graffiti is allowed, and all the houses there are painted. This is the neighborhood around the local arts university.

How to find this place? Here is a landmark: this is what the area is called. If you type into Baidu map, it will show the correct location, south of Chongqing South Railway Station.

There is an amusement park in Chongqing called "Foreigners Street" (Yangrenjie). This is a real kingdom of kitsch and trashy architecture. A sort of <a href="../kazan">Yoshkar-Ola</a> in miniature.

Go ahead. There is a mountain with the inscription Love. There were once plans to make a sex-themed park here (like Love Land in South Korea), but the public was outraged and the project was closed.

Among all this kitsch stands a building that looks like a German or Scandinavian church.

<p>
This is really a church, there aren't even flashy posters or attractions inside. But amid the surrounding madness, it looks like postmodern banter at kitsch. Really, the Chinese have nothing sacred.

<h2>Guiyang</h2>
<p>
Guiyang is the capital of Guizhou Province. The province is bad by Chinese standards, one of the last places in terms of salaries. If you wish, you can find something to see in this region. There are many mountains, beautiful scenery and several old towns, but all this can also be found in the neighboring regions of Hunan and Guangxi, and it is more accessible and cheaper there because it is not so far to travel. That’s why Guizhou province ended in Guiyang for me.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257199230_8d9656e15d_o.jpg">
<p>
Guiyang is immediately greeting with chaos. The station square is in complete chaos.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256903994_7075abfea6_o.jpg">
<p>
Cars, buses - all in one pile.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256155781_1bda90c1d2_o.jpg">
<p>
The station is located on a hill, right from there you can go down one floor, and there will be an area with cheap canteens and hotels. Guiyang is the first city in China where I saw prostitutes standing openly on the street (the second would be Shanghai).
<p/>

There is an interesting self-service dining format here: for only 10 yuan!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256903894_1e31c8b97f_o.jpg">
<p>
You throw whatever you can in your plate. Not much meat - a lot of fat and bones. Everything is very spicy. But it's 10 yuan.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256903964_5f1147274f_o.jpg">
<p>
In general, the main feature of Guiyang turned out to be that for some reason everything here is very expensive. Maybe because the first hieroglyph in the name of the city means “expensive”? Pineapples on a stick cost 5 yuan, although throughout the country they cost 2, maximum 3 yuan.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256904494_3216da3254_o.jpg">

There are also traffic jams here.

Everywhere in China they dance in parks, and in Guiyang they sing. When you stand between two pavilions with singers, you hear a cacophony.

<p>
Having nothing better to do, we arranged a photo shoot on these pretentious antique chairs. There are tourists in Guiyang, however, what they do there is unclear, but they are taken on an excursion to the pavilion.

To make it less boring, they placed a golden flying saucer in front of Mao.
