<h1>Western Sahara: Laayoune</h1>
<i>26-28 September 2012</i>
<p>
The Spanish colonized Western Sahara in the 20th century, apparently landing from the Canary Islands. Natural conditions are not conducive to long-term residence, so the population there was small. When the Spaniards left in 1975, neighboring Morocco and Mauritania wanted to indulge their imperial ambitions and at the same time seize phosphate deposits. In response to this, local independence fighters launched a guerrilla war in the desert. Mauritania got scared and ran away, but in Morocco the king turned out to be a good guy, he adopted the best technologies of the Evil Empire and built a wall across the entire country. In subsequent years, the Great Moroccan Wall was completed, fencing off more and more new areas, as a result, by the time the Berlin Wall fell, almost the entire territory of Western Sahara was fenced with a wall, and the rebels were thrown into the distant desert on the Algerian border. Now there is only a small area on the border with Mauritania after the border post, controlled by al-Qaeda bandits and rebels, from where it is theoretically possible to drive beyond the Wall.

On most maps, Western Sahara is marked as at least a separate territory, but in fact this country only exists on the maps. The Moroccan government decided to integrate Western Sahara into Morocco, as a result, now on all Moroccan maps they are drawn as one country, and even without an eastern border with Algeria. Entry from Morocco is completely free, but passports are still checked. Most of the foreigners are UN soldiers and their relatives.

The Moroccan occupiers decided to bring typical imperial pathos to Western Sahara. Oddly enough, in the capital, Laayoune, it looks decent and does not cause gag reflexes.

The first episode of Star Wars could have been filmed in the central square.

To the side of the pink space rockets is a structure that looks like a futuristic bus stop.

<p>
In fact, of course, this is not a stop at all, if only because there are no buses in Laayoune. This is a monument to the unification of Morocco and Western Sahara. On the stone in the middle there is something written about it and a sovereign map is drawn.

Another example of space architecture is water towers.

<p>
Since there is desert around, many small buildings have egg-shaped roofs to prevent sand from accumulating.

<p>
The old quarters, built under the Spanish in the 1930s, already look shabby.
<p/>

<p>
The Spaniards also left a Catholic cathedral of unimaginable shape, similar to a factory.
<p/>

<p>
The round roofs make the local market look like a bazaar located under an ancient Roman aqueduct.

<p>
The new areas are quite similar to the old ones, with only 25% more pathos and pretentiousness.

About 30 kilometers from Laayoune there is the Port of Laayoune, which on Google maps for some reason is called Laayoune Beach, although the locals do not understand this name. The city makes a depressing impression compared to Laayoune. They replaced the pink color with white and blue, and everything that was hidden immediately became visible.
<p/>

Only individual houses look decent.

There are also bars on the windows.

<p>
It seems that the city tried to build something like a large hotel for tourists, but abandoned it.
<p/>

The city was surrounded by a wall with holes, like Timbuktu.

And of course, in the middle of all this disgrace, they erected a triumphal arch!

The population of Western Sahara consists predominantly of Moroccans, although more conservatism is noticeable than in Casablanca.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255602772_3cf30d4da8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At the same time, there are quite a lot of people who look like people from more southern countries like Mauritania. Somewhere in the middle are the Sahrawis.

The latest Western Saharan fashion is to wear huge hipster glasses right over the burqa.

The population of Laayoune is about 200,000 people. From one end of the city to the other, it is two and a half hours from west to east and no more than an hour from north to south. There is no public transport in Laayoune; everyone takes taxis instead. This is convenient, since a trip to anywhere in the city costs 5 dirhams per person ($0.6).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256333316_afe69c9b6d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are intercity buses with a schedule that is not very clear. Apparently, all buses pass through here and tickets are not sold in advance. The stop is located on one of the squares.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257080279_df880c6d21_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A more realistic way to travel to another city is a Grand Taxi. This is a white Mercedes, into which six (!) people are packed, not counting the driver: two in the front seat and four in the back. In order for the car to move, six seats must be paid for, that is, theoretically, you can rent the entire car for yourself, the prices are fixed. Getting to the port (half an hour in a straight line) costs 54 dirhams ($7) for 6 seats. The taxi rank is located on the outskirts of the city behind the military base. Taxi drivers look colorful in white robes and turbans. I was able to communicate with one of them in Spanish instead of my very broken French.

<p>
Although there has been no military action for more than 20 years, there are still checkpoints on the roads. Having learned about this, I even prepared a piece of paper with my passport number and other information in advance, but it was not needed. The checkpoints look completely different from how I imagined them, more like a traffic police post: a booth and a couple of people in uniform stand by the road and slow down cars. Passport numbers are copied into a notebook. The check, as it turned out, was random. There are at least two checkpoints on the road to the port, one near Laayoune and one near the port, but I was only checked once on the way there.

Stones with distance signs are placed along the roads.

<p>
Traffic around the city is very brisk, especially in the evening. This is difficult to imagine in a Russian city with a population of 200 thousand. There are traffic police booths at intersections, but the policemen themselves are still usually right on the road.

Navigating the city is surprisingly easy even without a map, fortunately the streets are well marked. The signs are similar to those in Rabat with coats of arms.

Further away, in residential areas, the streets are either numbered or named with letters.
<p/>

<p>
The entrances to the houses are tiled.

In some places there are reminders of Spain in the form of inscriptions. Plus, Spanish is relatively popular here compared to English, although less than French.

<p>
An excellent hotel costs only $20 per day. There is even Wi-fi, which cannot be said about many Russian, and not only Russian, hotels for twice the money. For some reason, the location is usually defined as Agadir.

<p>
Unlike Morocco, I would love to return to Western Sahara someday for a week, live a quiet life in Laayoune or get a car (costs about 20 euros per day). This is probably one of the very few countries where a car can be really useful, because the wait for a Grand Taxi can be long, and you won’t be able to drive it into the desert. And the desert, as well as the coast, is definitely worth a visit.

Everyone is sure that the Sahara Desert looks something like this:
<p/>

<p>
Of course, such places do exist, but you have to look for them. Most of it consists of approximately the following landscapes:
<p/>

<p>
Near Port Laayoune there is the best beach I have ever seen. Huge, sandy, and completely empty. The complete opposite of Crimea and Egypt. On such a beach it’s not a sin to relax and lie around.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256862408_4d12cf583a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At the same time, you can go and see the local beauty, leaving your mark in history along the way.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255933322_8a7f7b6f27_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Some people even live far from the beach.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257408604_645bcc6c95_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Even further there is an abandoned warehouse
<p/>

<p>
Flocks of seagulls sit right on the shore, but when they see a person they fly slightly to the side.
<p/>

<p>
Further from the coast there is a desert with small thorns.
<p/>

<p>
Along the road there are sometimes almost canonical desert landscapes with mountains of sand and a complete absence of vegetation.
<p/>

<p>
But the most incredible beauty is to the north of the city. The Seguiet el-Hamra River flows here (or rather stands).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257374475_d5ab845908_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a small oasis around the river, and right behind it the dunes begin.
<p/>

<p>
In some places the river has almost dried up, leaving only wet sand and foam on it.
<p/>

Indescribable beauty, and no one around.

Why isn't this place a popular tourist destination? Let's give the floor to the people of Western Sahara.
