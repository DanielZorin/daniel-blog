<h1>Kyrgyzstan: Bishkek, Cholpon Ata, Osh, Jalal-Abad</h1>
<i>29 April - 4 May 2013</i>
<h2>Bishkek</h2>
<p>
Bishkek is more of a transit point for tourists, since there is nothing outstanding in the city. However, it is a very large city, with a population of one million, and rapidly developing. Now there is a boom in post-industrial society - office workers are needed.
<p/>

<p>
The office recruits young and ambitious people.

<p>
The central part of the city consists of two streets - Chuisky Prospekt and Frunze Street.

Behind these streets are private houses.

Those who are richer build modern luxury houses.

And someone still lives in an old house near the central square.

The Soviet symbols are gradually being driven out of sight.

<p>
Lenin used to stand on the other side of this building, on the central square. Now Manas, the legendary Kyrgyz hero, stands there. After decolonization in 1991, the countries of Central Asia found heroes in ancient history who they made their new idols. In Kyrgyzstan - Manas, in Uzbekistan - Tamerlane, in Tajikistan - Ismail Somoni.

A monument has already been erected in honor of the 2010 revolution.

<p>
On the fence of the White House, the walls of which were repainted to remove bullet marks, there is a memorial plaque that says something about the overthrow of the totalitarian regime and the advent of democracy. After the overthrow of Bakiyev, the constitution was changed in Kyrgyzstan so that the country became a parliamentary republic, and one president could not seize unlimited power.

<p>
There are still soda fountains left from the USSR. Some of them work. It is interesting that in the USSR, water with gas cost 3 kopecks, and with syrup - 5 kopecks, but now the same prices are in soms, and coins with an unusual denomination of 3 soms are in use.
<p/>

Typical houses in Central Asia are decorated with national patterns. In Russia, a zigzag pattern is usually drawn.

Monument to Kyrgyz academicians. There is also the name of Askar Akayev, the first president overthrown during the 2005 revolution.

The prices in the restaurants are very attractive. $1 = 20 som.

An unusual local expression is "Loading units". This means topping up your mobile phone account. In the Internet cafes here they like to download abstracts. Later in Tajikistan, in a similar cafe, I even helped people search for abstracts on Google.

It is customary to ride standing in minibuses in Bishkek. There is a terrible crowd there, you have to stand in strange crooked positions and also hold on to something so as not to fall off when turning. Intercity minibuses are more civilized; everyone at least sits in them, although some people board along the way to travel a short distance; they can also travel standing.

At the beginning of May it is a little cold around Issyk-Kul, the season begins in June. I was the only tourist in the whole town. It was not possible to swim; you could only go into the icy water up to your ankles.
<p/>

Walking along the shore of the lake is problematic, since parts of the beach are fenced off by local sanatoriums, and they are completely fenced off, so you can only swim around the fence.
<p/>

Many inscriptions are duplicated in English.

As in other beach resorts in the CIS, almost every house has rooms for rent. Patriotic gate.

There are radicals in Kyrgyzstan too, but not many.

The food in Kyrgyzstan is divine. I went into restaurants and took all kinds of dishes with unfamiliar names. Never disappointed. This dish is called lagman (in Uzbekistan - lagmon).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255290702_a9774669a7_o.jpg">
<p>
The dish in the center is the leader of the hit parade, “Ashlyan-fu in Karakol style.” Served mainly in the north of Kyrgyzstan (Karakol is a city on the shore of Issyk-Kul). In the distance is a dish called "kuurdak".
<p/>

A visit to Issyk-Kul would be incomplete without a walk through the surrounding mountains.

Chingish, Ahmed and Beksultan helped me with this. Here they are near a stone that looks like a house on a slope.

Near the lake the mountains are low, and a little further there are snowy peaks. Behind them is Kazakhstan.

<p>
By the way, the guys explained to me that in Russian the correct word is “Kirgiziya”, and in Kyrgyz (they say “in Kyrgyz”) - “Kyrgyzstan”. In this regard, the opinion of residents of Kyrgyzstan is not similar to the opinion of residents of Ukraine and Moldova/Moldova on similar issues.

On the other hand, you have to walk over piles of stones.

<h2>Osh</h2>
<p>
The city of Osh is known mainly as the cradle of the 2005 Kyrgyz revolution, the center of the 2010 counter-revolution, and as the site of massacres between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks in 1990 and 2010. The mechanics of such events remain a mystery to me. Everything seems to be calm in the city, life is in full swing, no tension is felt in the air. And when the food runs out, a war begins, and for some reason the neighbors are to blame.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256599206_76037876f9_o.jpg">
<p>
Nowadays, the only reminders of the events of 2010 are the posters that are hung quite often stating that this or that building is under armed guard. This is the door of the Alai Hotel, where I lived (single rooms for $13, there are cheaper ones without a toilet). In 2010 there were barricades and gunfire here.
<p/>

<p>
The huge bazaar of Osh stands near a stormy dirty river, and from there it looks like the memorable slums of <a href="../indonesia-1">Jakarta</a>.
<p/>

The main road in the middle of the bazaar is littered with piles of stones.

Nevertheless, cars manage to drive on it.

<p>
You can buy everything at the market and very cheaply. I bought a deck of cards for 7 rubles, a hat for 100 and a set of safety pins for 3.

Somehow very little is written about Osh in guidebooks on the Internet. I learned about the main attraction of Osh - Mount Suleiman-Too - from the magazine of the Kyrgyzstan airline, which I read on the plane on the way to Osh. The flight took place over beautiful mountains. If you go from Bishkek to Osh by car, you can see it all up close, but it is very tiring - at least 9 hours of travel.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256800643_aa885ab63d_o.jpg">
<p>
Suleiman-Too ("Suleimanka") is a favorite vacation spot for townspeople. Entrance costs a ridiculous 2 rubles ($0.05).

<p>
There are many caves in the mountain. One of them is equipped with a museum, which was not open that day. You can crawl inside if you lie on your stomach. Higher up there are large caves, or rather, just depressions in the rock. There is a road around the mountain with stairs and railings, but you have to climb into the caves along steep paths.
<p/>

Interestingly, modern passports in the form of ID cards have already been introduced in Kyrgyzstan. At the Kazakh border, most showed these to the border guard. Meanwhile, in the great and rich Russia, people still walk around with ugly books consisting of 25 empty unnecessary pages.

Topping up a mobile account in Osh, unlike in the north of the country, is called “Web-cash”.

<h2>Jalal-Abad</h2>
<p>
To be honest, I went to Jalal-Abad because I liked the name of the city. Taxi drivers at the station, by the way, simply say “Jalabad”. As it turns out, there's not much to see here. At the entrance to the city there is an arch and a monument, and there seems to be a large sanatorium. The central street is Lenin Street.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255495482_cbd04b9cdf_o.jpg">
<p>
In 2010, as in Osh, there were pogroms here, however, even without pogroms it’s not fun here. Some kind of half-abandoned military base behind a fence with barbed wire. There are still soldiers with machine guns standing on the towers around the perimeter.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255495642_3ebf9d68fb_o.jpg">

In Jalal-Abad, both the Osh “Web-cash” and the Bishkek “Loading units” are in use.

After six hours, you can only leave Jalal-Abad for Osh by taxi. I managed to snack on the last remaining kebabs in a diner with typical Central Asian tables.

Suddenly, in a taxi, I met a compatriot from Kolomna, who was born in Kyrgyzstan, but came to visit these places for the first time since 1991. He was very surprised that I decided to travel around the Fergana Valley, and advised me to be careful.
