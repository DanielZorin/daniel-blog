<h1>Turkey: Istanbul</h1>
<i>4-7 May 2023</i>
<h2>Istanbul</h2>
<p>
During the transit through Istanbul, I decided to stop in the city for a couple of days, instead of immediately flying on. Each time the city becomes more and more familiar, especially since I constantly live and walk in approximately the same places from Taksim to Fatih.

<p>
There was a great view of Istanbul from the plane.

<p>
In the spring of 2023, a metro line to the new airport opened (and at the same time another line to Sabiha Airport). The station is a short distance from the airport and offers panoramic views.

<p>
The ticket costs a little more than on regular metro lines and buses: 12.70 liras versus 9.90. The line was not completed to the end, because of this, now it is necessary to transfer to the pink line, and from the pink to the green, which already reaches the center. The Istanbul metro is gradually beginning to resemble a transport system, and not a collection of branches hanging in the air, almost in no way connected with each other. Transfers are organized in the most strange way - everywhere you need to leave one line and go through the turnstiles to another, a lot of walking and stairs. Moreover, from 2023, in order for transfers to be free/cheap, the travel card must be linked to a Turkish ID, that is, tourists pay the full price for each transfer. The most annoying thing is that even though I have an ID, but due to the fact that I linked the card to the Covid QR code in 2021, now I can’t relink it, I need to go somewhere to complain, write applications, etc. I should have bought a new card, but I was too lazy - it would only pay off on a hypothetical future trip.
However, even with payment for all transfers to the center by metro, it turns out to be less than 33 liras, which is half the price of even a bus, not to mention a taxi.

At the end there is a Telegram advertisement on the ceiling.

Opposition coalition candidate Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu uses the slogan “You have the floor!” This poster promises to abolish the sale of Turkish citizenship by investment. At the moment, you can obtain Turkish citizenship if you buy real estate for 450 thousand dollars. In general, it is twice as expensive as on the Caribbean islands, and Turkish citizenship is not very convenient for travel - you need to get a Schengen visa, and it is hard to get. But this is the only country that still sells citizenship to Russians, so there is demand.

Concerts of Russian-speaking musicians and actors are now constantly in Turkey.

<p>
Since January, everything has become more expensive, in my favorite restaurant Ortaklar, an adana kebab now costs 105 liras (it was, it seems, 80 or 85), and in other places in the center it’s at least 150, or even 250.

I devoted one day to a walk around the Fener district. This is an area on the banks of the Golden Horn away from the center, but inside the walls. Historically, this is the Christian (Greek) area of ​​Istanbul. Getting there is not very convenient, since the tram line running along the shore of the Golden Horn is for some reason literally a kilometer short of connecting with the main tram line passing through the center, so the closest option is to get off at the Halic metro station, on the metro bridge, and walk from there.
