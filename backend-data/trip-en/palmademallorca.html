<h1>Spain: Barcelona, Palma de Mallorca, Soller, Girona</h1>
<i>24-30 March 2018</i>
<h2>Barcelona</h2>
<p>
Four years have passed since my <a href="../bilbao">last visit to Barcelona</a> and 7 whole years since <a href="../barcelona">the first</a> (and by far the longest) visit. I got a ticket for some charter for 2,500 rubles ($40), I quickly found tickets from Girona to Lithuania in a week for some ridiculously small money, and together with the cheap Kaliningrad train, the total two-way fare came out to much less than $100.

<p>
The most noticeable thing that has changed in Barcelona during this time is that housing has become more expensive. In 2013-2014, I went to booking and booked a room near the center in a hotel for less than 20 euros, and a place in a hostel where I once stayed cost 5 or 6. In 2018, a place in a hostel cost more than 20 euros , and the hotel is closer to 60, although the end of March is far from peak time. You could find it cheaper for one day, but you can’t move for 6 days in a row every day, right? Even on airbnb, although I found housing for $35, I still had to move on the last day, since it was not possible to book for all the days. Most of the time I lived near the Sagrada Familia. It's not that close to the old town, so I've only been to this area before on my very first trip, and never made it here while transiting through Barcelona.

<p>
The Sagrada Familia is slowly being finished, it’s not clear when it’ll be ready. They promise for Gaudí's centenary in 2026.

<p>
There was also this skyscraper (Agbar Tower) within walking distance from the apartment; previously I had only seen it from observation platforms.
<p/>

<p>
Not far from the skyscraper, a tent city was discovered under the overpass.

The most interesting thing about it is the roof.

The reflections in it turn out to be pretentious due to the large number of glasses with different angles.

In the fall of 2017, a referendum on the independence of Catalonia was held, which was not recognized by the Spanish authorities. Its organizers fled the country or went to prison, but weekly protests on the streets continued for a long time, including in March 2018.
<p/>

I just happened to attend one such rally.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256099988_fb96b13b0f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The main slogan was “Freedom for political prisoners!”
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256099953_ba0352dbf6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It was the most massive event I have ever seen; not a single music festival came close, not to mention the rallies in Moscow even in 2011.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256100008_4e33c3f3bb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
People walked like this for about 30 minutes, and this was only the beginning, and the main mass was further along.

What else has changed in Barcelona - ticket prices for most attractions have increased 2-3 times, much higher than inflation. Here Mila's house, for example, is already about 25 euros.

Since I came to Barcelona for a substntial amount of time, I visited many attractions that are far from the center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255898316_b22eb4b5ff_h.jpg"/>

<p>

<p>
Interestingly, entrance to it also became paid - 7 euros. Most of the park, however, is free.

There is a poster on the subway against manspreading - this is when you sit with your legs spread wide apart. It’s also interesting that it turns out that you can’t take photographs in the Barcelona metro; at least at one of the stations the cops forbade me.

On the last day I moved to another apartment, in the west of the city, near the Montjuic hill. On this occasion, I walked along this hill and adjacent places.

And on the far side of Montjuic from the center there is a large cemetery. I came across it by chance, I didn’t know about it before, and this became the main discovery of this trip to Barcelona.

From a distance it may seem that its contours resemble a Soviet residential area, but in fact these are multi-story columbariums.

We can see similar places in many cemeteries in Europe, but usually it is one columbarium corner with several blocks, but here it’s practically an entire city. Incredible place.

<h2>Palma de Mallorca</h2>
<p>
My plans at that time did not include moving within Spain; I wanted to base myself in Barcelona. Thinking about where I could go for one day without an overnight stay, I chose an unexpected option - the island of Mallorca. The flight took less than an hour, and round-trip tickets cost only about 40 euros - no more expensive than going to <a href="../andorra">Andorra</a>. Mallorca is another region of Spain, the Balearic Islands (the other two large islands are Menorca and Ibiza).

The bus from the airport arrives at a bus station deep underground; on the floor above there is a metro, which I did not take because it goes to the outskirts.

<h2>Soller</h2>
<p>
After exploring Palma, I decided to take a ride around the island itself. All the most interesting things are there in the northwestern part, where a small mountain range is located. The most easily accessible destination is the city of Soller and its port (Port de Soller).

In addition to the bus, Soller is served by an old tram, one of the oldest in Spain, along with the Tibidabo tram in Barcelona.

<h2>Girona</h2>
<p>
I stayed in Girona for one night to catch an early flight from the airport (some low-cost airlines fly here as an alternative to Barcelona). I was already <a href="../girona">passing through this city in 2013</a>.
<p/>

<p>
That time, however, I did not reach the city walls, mainly due to bad weather. This time there was no rain; on the contrary, the weather was beautiful.
