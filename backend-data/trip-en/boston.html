<h2>Boston</h2>
<p>
Boston is home to two of the three most famous universities in the United States: Harvard and MIT. Let's start with the second one, especially since it is more in line with my profile. MIT's main building is designed in the style of ancient Roman temples and palaces.

At MIT, there are quite often “lounges” where you can hang out during a break and discuss calculus.

In addition to the president, Massachusetts was holding a local referendum on four issues that day, including number 4, the legalization of marijuana. Unlike the presidential election, this one went well for this blue state.

Formally, MIT and Harvard are not located in Boston, but in the neighboring city of Cambridge, which can be reached by crossing to the other side of the river (or by taking the subway). Cambridge is obviously named after the city of the same name in England, where one of the two most famous British universities is located.

Harvard even conducts tours for tourist groups, so visitors are treated much less friendly here than at MIT. Entry into all buildings is officially restricted to students and staff only.

From here I turned back south. Let's look at prices in New York. A rickshaw puller earns $4 per minute, compared to less than $1 per hour in India. I also want to earn $240 an hour, who is last in line? Otherwise, like a sucker, I work as a programmer for a salary that is 10 times less.

Prices at the hairdresser. Haircut - $35, manicure - $25. For comparison, in Moscow, approximately 1000 and 500 rubles, respectively (if you don’t look for the cheapest place). It’s even strange that it’s only twice as expensive.

Buffet for $22. In theory, there are several cheaper buffets in Chicago, even less than $15 - a very tempting offer, but they are all incredibly far away - you not only have to take 20 subway stations, but then another 10 by bus. Well, or by car, 40-50 minutes one way. And it is like this almost always in this country. Imagine that in Moscow, in order to eat for less than $100 or go to the supermarket, you would have to go at least to Biryulyovo, or even to Lyubertsy.
