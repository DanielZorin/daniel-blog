<h1>Ukraine: Feodosia</h1>
<i>July 2005</i>
<h2>Feodosia</h2>
<p>
The next summer I found myself in Crimea again. This was six months after the first (Orange) revolution. Oddly enough, the owner of the house did not have views typical of Crimea, and told how he went to the Maidan in winter. Otherwise, nothing much has changed there. Except that I had a film camera and saved a few photographs.
