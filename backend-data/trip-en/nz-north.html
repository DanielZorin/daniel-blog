<h1>New Zealand: Wellington, Taupo, Tongariro, Rotorua, Auckland, Bay of Islands</h1>

<h2>Wellington</h2>
<p>
Wellington is the capital of New Zealand, but not the largest city. The capital was moved here so that it would be in the middle of the country, and not on the northern edge.
<p/>

<p>
Wellington is known for its extreme climate with very strong winds. The local airport is one of the most difficult to land. Luckily the wind was moderate when I was in town.
<p/>

<p>
The city center is quite densely built up, something I have never seen on the South Island.

The New Zealand Parliament building, known as the beehive. I think I saw something similar in an old computer game.

<p>
From here trains depart a couple of times a day across the island to Auckland and there are many commuter trains. Platform 9 and 3/4 is somehow between 6 and 7.

<p>
There are high hills on all sides, followed by steep serpentines leading to residential areas. According to the map, I lived only 2 kilometers from the railway station, but I traveled by bus because the elevation difference was something like this:

Let's look at a supermarket in New Zealand. This is a Countdown store in Wellington. Countdown is the most frequently encountered chain; among the larger ones there is also Park'n'Save (analogous to Auchan), but the prices there are not much lower, only the range is smaller.
New Zealand is not the cheapest country, let's see what you can buy here. Prices are in New Zealand dollars, 1 NZD = 42 rubles, or 0.70 US dollars. Let's start with vegetables and fruits. They are all quite expensive, like in America. Apples - 2.50 NZD. The cheapest fruit.
<p/>

A whole chicken costs $9, which is three times more expensive than in Russia. Interestingly, the chicken says Free Range, which means it was not raised in a cage. The same inscriptions canbe found on the eggs.
In the center is $13 rack of lamb in a sweet marinade, my favorite dish from New Zealand.

Just like in the US, in New Zealand people doesn't eat fresh bread. Even in this store - not a discounter - there is no bread, only toast. Bread can only be found in rare bakeries.

What can I say, grocery shopping in New Zealand is not cheap; most goods are much more expensive than in Europe or Australia. While in Australia I could easily pick up a bunch of groceries for cheap in relatively large portions, here there are almost no such options, and very few promotions. What I remember most was the rack of lamb.
<p/>
<h2>Taupo</h2>
<p>
The town of Taupo stands on the shores of the lake of the same name, which is actually the mouth of a huge volcano. Its last eruption was around 180 AD, and it is one of the largest eruptions in the last 2000 years.

<h2>Tongariro National Park</h2>
<p>
Tongariro National Park is the main park of the North Island, popularly best known as the prototype of Mordor in the movies "The Lord of the Rings". This is a high mountain area in the center of the island with several active volcanoes. Basically, everyone walks along the Tongariro Alpine Crossing track, which is about 18 kilometers long, possible to complete in one day. The track starts and ends in different places, so even if you drive your own car to the start, you will still need a shuttle from the end point. I took the bus from Taupo (70 NZD round trip), there are also shuttles from the closer town of Turangi for 55 NZD.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256684940_8b75b3b267_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The shuttle arrived at the entrance site just before dawn. There seemed to be quite a lot of people, but after the start of the mountain sections everyone dispersed, there was no longer a crowd.
<p/>

Mount Ruapehu is visible in the distance.

<p>
The first 4 kilometers the road goes through a volcanic valley with a very small elevation difference.

<p>
Then the climb begins to about 400 meters.

A few years ago you could go up to its crater (and throw a ring there), but now this is prohibited under the pretext that it is sacred. Too many people threw rings?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256388584_bbff0b34b9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The second climb is shorter, but technically more difficult. If it had rained, climbing these rocks would have been a bit daunting.
<p/>

<p>
But the weather was so perfect that with such a clear sky it didn’t look much like Mordor.
<p/>

<p>
This is the top point of the route, from here the road is mostly downhill. Quite a lot of people relax here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255639251_5f13e4395c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
From the side you can look at the red crater.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255639366_7df5054f26_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Then the most fun part is the sharp descent down into the valley on the other side of the crater. There is no path here, only loose volcanic ash, and you slide down like on sand. In some places the ground is really hot, you can cook food by burying it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254910127_6e838b7396_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is what the descent looks like.
<p/>

<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254910182_08c3c5a4a5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are several volcanic lakes below.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255844098_d0eb521ab1_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255844143_b2f577f1c0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It’s surprising that no more than 10% of people come closer to the lake, although this is a detour of only 100 meters.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256389009_e9fdd61f64_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Then cross another valley, a small climb to a blue lake.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254910352_03784d49ca_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The descent was in the distance to the left, where there was smoke.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254910387_2cf49eee5c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And beyond the pass there is a long road down.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256685685_dea62366ca_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It’s just a long serpentine road for about 10 kilometers. You can see Lake Taupo in the distance, and another lake closer.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256389164_291d7f1d40_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256389194_db3a3b902c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are traces of eruptions on the slopes.
<p/>

<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255639696_e9fab4836d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In some places the outer slopes are also smoking, there may be hot springs, but there doesn’t seem to be a road there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255639721_4af5fa331d_h.jpg"/>

<p>
In principle, you can walk the track in the opposite direction, it is more difficult because the end point is lower than the starting point, which means the climb will take longer.
<p/>

But the main tourist spot in Rotorua is the Valley of Geysers. There is one valley, and two parks, on different sides of the main geyser. The entry price for them is approximately the same - more than 50 NZD. I went to Te Puia Park, from where you can see the geysers closer.

In Te Puia you can also see the kiwi - the symbol of New Zealand. Kiwis are nocturnal birds, so special enclosures are made for them, where it is dark and infrared lighting is on. Of course, you can't take photographs. Kiwis are fun and a lot bigger than I thought - about the size of a chicken rather than a kiwi fruit.

<h2>Auckland</h2>
<p>
Auckland is New Zealand's largest city by a wide margin. Formally, it is 5 times larger than Wellington, but they feel about the same size, apparently, it’s just that in Auckland the area of ​​​​one-story districts is much larger, because the area around is almost flat.

If you look towards the outskirts, you can see that there are also similar smaller volcano hills around.

Most migrants in New Zealand stay in Auckland, where there is most work. Since most migrants are from Asia, Auckland is a very Asian city. There are signs in Chinese and Korean everywhere.

Auckland has double-decker buses. Travel is expensive - for cash 3.50 only in the first zone, and my house was in the second (although it was possible to get out 700 meters earlier, still the first zone). With a travel card, one zone costs a little less than $2, although the card itself costs $10 and the deposit is not refundable. It still pays off quickly.
<p/>

<p>
There is also a system of commuter trains, which is useful for tourists mainly to get to the airport (you still have to travel a short distance by bus). The metro is under construction.

<h2>Bay of Islands</h2>
<p>
The last trip in New Zealand was to the very north of the North Island, to the Bay of Islands. The site has some historical significance as it is where Captain James Cook first met the Maori and where the Treaty of Waitangi was signed, under which New Zealand became a British colony.
<p/>

<p>
Bay cruises depart from Paihia. You can get there either by regular bus or by excursion bus. I went there on a regular route and back on a tour, so I had time to walk around the city before the cruise.

The village of Waitangi, where the treaty was signed, is located across the river, about 30 minutes’ walk from Paihia.
<p/>

<p>
Unexpectedly, it turned out that the site of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi is almost the most expensive attraction in New Zealand; admission costs more than $50! For the first time I see that the price does not correspond so much to the interestingness of the place. To be honest, I was sure that admission was free, as is usually the case in such places of historical events.

I ended up walking around the perimeter. Judging by the photographs, the inside is just a field and one long Maori house with a triangular roof.

Welcome back to Paihia. It's time to get on the ship.
<p/>

<p>
First, the ship crosses the bay, on the other side of which is the city of Russell. Some passengers sit there.
<p/>

<p>
You can get to Russell by ferry from Paihia for $7, or by car, but it's a long detour.

Cruise ship captains already know well where to look for them, so we go to the dolphins almost immediately.

Below is the lighthouse keeper's house. Now no one lives there because the lighthouse is automatic. The house has been converted into a backpackers' hostel, one of many similar ones on New Zealand's hiking trails.

The weather that day was good, before approaching the rock there was almost no rocking, which made me very happy (I don’t tolerate rocking very well). It seems that if there are no waves at all, the ship can pass under the rock.
