<h1>France: Orleans, Blois, Angers, Paris</h1>
<i>6-9 March 2014</i>
<h2>Orleans</h2>
<p>
The city of Orleans is associated primarily with Joan of Arc, who won her most famous victory here (and became known as the <i>Maid of Orleans</i>). It is also the capital of the unassumingly named "Centre" region of France, also known as the Loire Valley (Val de Loire, not to be confused with the neighboring Pays de la Loire region).

<h2>Blois</h2>
<p>
<i>In mid-May 1660, at nine o'clock in the morning, when the sun, which had already begun to get hot, had dried the dew on the gesso of the castle of Blois, a small cavalcade, consisting of three nobles and two pages, drove across the city bridge, without making much of an impression on the walkers along the embankment...</i>
Sorry, I got distracted. So, in Blois there is a castle where some French kings lived, where the Duke of Guise was killed and where the action of Dumas' novel “Ten Years Later” begins.
<p/>

<p>
The castle is known for having been completed in different styles by different owners, which makes it look strange.

<h2>Angers</h2>
<p>
I was in Angers going to the ICORES 2014 conference, which stands for “operations research conference.” Operations research is one of the branches of mathematics. The conference took place at ESEO (Ecole Supérieure des Engineeringes de Ouest, France), whose premises are located just outside the city.
<p/>

<p>
The average person, far from science, knows about it only from rare media reports about breakthroughs such as the discovery of the Higgs boson or the proof of the Poincaré hypothesis, but it is still impossible to understand the content of the discoveries without proper preparation. One may get the impression that scientists are a narrow group of thought giants who come up with some breakthrough discovery every few years. This was the case in the nineteenth century and earlier, but now the vast majority of scientists are engaged in applied problems and this is how they earn their bread and black caviar. Fundamental science is financed by grants, the availability of which depends on the welfare of the state, while applied research is financed by business, which undoubtedly reduces bureaucratic barriers.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256568114_b3935927d0_o.jpg">
<p>
Accordingly, a conference is not a meeting of people who deal with the same issues (unlike conferences of politicians or businessmen), but a platform where everyone talks about their achievements. The main goals of scientific conferences are to learn about what types of problems colleagues in other cities and countries are working on (both the formulation and the methods of solution can be interesting in themselves), as well as to communicate with each other and, possibly, with potential customers. There are also mercantile goals - publications and reports are needed to maintain the citation index. Russian institutes and universities became concerned about this relatively recently; before that, Russian scientists considered themselves self-sufficient, published only in Russian, and then wondered why Moscow State University was at the bottom in the rankings, which primarily because of zero citation rates.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255089852_895b4f6c0c_o.jpg">
<p>
To participate in the conference you need to pay a fee, which on reputable forums averages 500-700 euros. As a rule, trips to conferences are paid for by the employer as business travel. For your contribution you receive a badge, conference materials, often also a backpack or briefcase to go with them, and the opportunity to attend meetings. In reality, if it’s not happening in Russia, where institutes have access control, no one really monitors it, so you can just listen without registration. Lunch, banquets and excursions around the area are also often included, but these may come at an additional cost. At Russian conferences, fees are much lower.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256022073_ea8d343a59_o.jpg">
<p>
The conference usually has several plenary sessions, where everyone gathers in a large hall. The report lasts 40-60 minutes. Invited speakers, reputable scientists, speak at plenary sessions; their participation is paid for by the organizers, and they do not have to write abstracts and an article for their report in the general manner.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256567789_2140d828c9_o.jpg">
<p>
Most reports are presented in sections limited to narrower topics. The list of sections is known in advance; when you submit an article for review, you indicate a specific section, although the organizers can place the report in another section at their discretion. Often several sections run in parallel. There were only two sections at ICORES: “Methodologies and Technologies” and “Applications”, and I did not notice any significant difference between them: both had theoretical and purely applied reports. There were two sessions in parallel. In general, this conference is not very large; out of ~100 papers, about 30% were accepted after peer review. Though, at the same time as ICORES, two more conferences were held in the same building: on artificial intelligence and image recognition. But the definite advantage was that everyone was given 20-30 minutes to present, and not 5-10, as usual. In 20-30 minutes you can speak in sufficient detail and clearly, and other people’s reports are also perceived much better.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255820006_b0952199f6_o.jpg">
<p>
A certain number of articles that were not included in the main conference program are accepted as “posters”. In this case, instead of an extended version of the article, you need to make a poster with illustrations. At the poster session, posters are hung on boards and you can chat with the authors.

<p>
The cooler the conference, the greater the presence of participants from other continents. People usually come to local conferences only from surrounding countries (for example, most Russian conferences are called “international” because there are a couple of participants from Belarus or Ukraine). There were people from America and Japan at ICORES, although there were more French, Germans, Italians and Spaniards. There were two Russians besides me.

I also walked around the ESEO building. The floors without conference meetings were empty because there was a vacation at the beginning of March.

Advertising: “I have the brains to study to become an engineer. What about you?” It is signed that the photo is a 1st year student. I wonder why feminists haven’t blown up the institute yet, because according to their concepts, such a poster is typical oppression and sexual exploitation of women?

Angers is located in the historical province of Anjou, where Angevin wine, D'Artagnan's favorite wine, is made. Now it is a relatively large, well-equipped French city.

The conference participant's kit included a tram pass to make it more convenient to travel to the institute on the outskirts of the city. In general, one trip costs 1.40 euros, 10 - 11.50 euros. A monthly pass costs about 40 euros, for people under 25 years old - about 30 euros, for pensioners over 65 - 6 euros. The tram runs approximately every 10 minutes during the day, less frequently on weekends and in the evening.

<h2>Paris</h2>
<p>
I was passing through Paris on my way to Angers. French railways can claim to be the worst in Europe (and maybe even the world). Firstly, their prices are very high, comparable only to Switzerland. An hour's trip on a French regional train costs as much as 20 euros (on a high-speed train - twice as much, but you can still buy it cheaper in advance online). But in Switzerland, at least local residents get a 50% discount, and in France, discounts are only for schoolchildren, pensioners and some other preferential categories of citizens. Secondly, trains rarely run. This is not Germany, where trains connect with waiting intervals of 5-10 minutes. I missed the train I needed from the airport, and the next one was only two hours later. And that was lucky, because after that there was a break of about four hours. In general, it is much more convenient to travel around France by car.
In two hours I managed to visit the Carrefour store, buy cheese, wine and a baguette, and also walk to Place de la Bastille, where I had never been before.

And here the Louvre and the Tuileries are already nearby. In the evening there is almost no one there, because... The park is closed, and you can’t really take a walk near the pyramid. But the entire axis of Paris is visible from the pyramid to the Arc de Triomphe. By the way, the <a href="../paris">Ferris wheel</a> has been removed.

Another 30 minutes on foot - and here it is, the Eastern Station, from where airport buses go (by the way, the Moscow-Paris train arrives here). It took me about four hours to cross the entire historical center of Paris.
