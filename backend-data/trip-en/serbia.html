<h1>Serbia: Belgrade, Novi Sad, Subotica</h1>
<i>28 November - 1 December 2013</i>
<h2>Belgrade</h2>
<p>
Russia and Serbia are fraternal countries. Orthodoxy, collapsed empires, millions of compatriots in separated countries, lack of allies - these are all known facts. But what about at the everyday level? Here Russia and Serbia also have a lot in common. For example, in no other countries have I seen boards placed in puddles so that people could cross these puddles.

Belgrade bus station, the picture is very familiar thanks to the stalls. However, this can also be found in <a href="../poland">other places</a> in Eastern Europe.

They are just beginning to learn English here.

Inscriptions on the walls in several layers, made in a clumsy way.

Here's more about Kosovo.

<p>
In general, there are few political inscriptions on the walls in relation to the total number. I found only one wall where they speak out.

And there is even a hotel "Moscow"!

<p>
The first McDonald's in Yugoslavia. History does not tell us about how long the queues were on opening day. There is a suspicion that they are not the same as in Moscow, because... Yugoslav citizens could travel abroad.

<p>
Yes, Serbia does not yet reach Western Europe (and in some details, even Eastern Europe), but Russia has a lot to learn from Belgrade. For example, in Belgrade there are excellent timetables and diagrams at all stops.

They also cook very well in Serbia, and food even in restaurants is cheap.
<p/>

<p>
It’s very interesting that in Serbia they write the letters “t” and “p” in cursive font. In Russia, this is how some people write them in cursive.

New ones are in Cyrillic and Latin. In general, most of the inscriptions are in Cyrillic, but Latin ones are also found.

I went to the Yugoslav History Museum.

The man who ruled Yugoslavia for 35 years is buried here.

<p>
Many people here are nostalgic for it, apparently because dictatorship is better than civil war and occupation.

Someone may reproach me for not saying anything about the sights of Belgrade.

Well, don’t sit back, go and see for yourself!

<h2>Novi Sad</h2>
<p>
The hotel cost only 12 euros. I expected a catch, but there was none. Indeed, 12 euros for a double room, and this is not even a hostel, there are four floors of rooms. And in the basement there is also an excellent restaurant where you can eat for $6. Rostil is grilled meat. Serbia historically does not like Muslims, so the majority of dishes are made from pork. A shot of brandy costs about $1, which is even cheaper than in the cheapest Russian bar.
<p/>

<p>
Novi Sad is nice. It is the capital of the only autonomy that has not separated from Serbia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257322309_b25302d6e3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In these places, the border between Austria and Turkey passed along the Danube, and the Novi Sad fortress was at the forefront.
<p/>

<p>
The number and multi-level bastions are impressive.

Night illumination.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257617455_5a240dd220_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also a small old part of the city around the fortress.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256574696_7d4d503623_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Most of the city is modern.

For some reason, Seselj is very popular in Vojvodina (it's that guy who promised to gouge out the eyes of the Croats with a rusty spoon, and was repeatedly sent to the Hague Tribunal). It seems that in his biography nothing is directly connected with Vojvodina.

The writing on the walls is random, just like in Belgrade. By the way, white pride.
<p/>

<p>

The Sberbank branch also links Serbia with Russia.

<p>
The intercom illustrates the situation with spelling in Serbia: some surnames are written in Cyrillic, some in Latin.

<h2>Subotica</h2>
<p>
Subotica is a Serbian town near the Hungarian border. The architecture here resembles <a href="../szeged">provincial Hungary</a>.

This place on Sunday serves a business lunch of soup, four different large pieces of meat with a side dish and dessert for some ridiculously small money.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257039908_8baa339845_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Subotica has very unusual mix of signs in Cyrillic, Latin and Hungarian.

Do not enter the bank wearing dark glasses or a disguise.

<p>
Even in such a small town as Subotica, parking is paid, $0.50 per hour.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255770108_1111fbab9e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And there is even a board showing the arrival time of the bus.
