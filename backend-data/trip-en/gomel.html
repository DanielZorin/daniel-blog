<h1>Belarus: Minsk, Mir, Nesvizh, Gomel</h1>
<i>12-14 January 2019</i>
<h2>Minsk</h2>
<p>
In January 2019, I decided to go to Belarus for the weekend, again to Minsk (where I was in 2011) and to places I had never been to before. Flying out of Moscow, I got acquainted with ZIA airport (Zhukovsky) for the first time, and at the same time saw Minsk airport for the first time (flying to Minsk by plane is cheaper than by direct train, but a little more expensive than by bus or trains with transfers).

<p>
I took a minibus from the airport to the center. The inscription on the minibus is in Chinese - a lot of Chinese tourists come here.

Near the station in one of the courtyards there is a monument to young Lenin.

There is another Lenin under the main square, at the metro station. His nose is rubbed so often that he appears drunk.

<h2>Mir</h2>
<p>
There are two castles in Belarus, both included in the UNESCO World Heritage List, and both near Minsk. The only problem was visiting them together without returning to Minsk - for this you had to adapt to the schedule of the bus, which runs only once a day in each direction. The first was Mir Castle. It is formally located in <a href="../grodno">Grodno region</a>, almost on the border with Minsk region.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257193194_774d9bdebe_o.jpg">

<p>
The village of Mir is quite small. It contains almost only private houses.

<p>
Mir was a Jewish town (shtetl), and the largest building besides the castle was the Jewish Academy (Yeshiva). Now there is a hotel there.
<p/>

The neighboring buildings housed synagogues and schools.

Mir Castle belonged to the Radziwills - a very rich family of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

Interestingly, part of the castle is given over to a hotel - you can stay in the castle for only 60 dollars.

The temperature was around zero, the snow was perfectly molded, and I couldn’t deny myself the pleasure of making a snowman.

<h2>Nesvizh</h2>
<p>
Nesvizh is a much larger city in the Minsk region than Mir. Here is the main castle of the Radziwills.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256539306_8384b716dc_o.jpg">

<p>
The main entrance is across the bridge over the moat.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255811397_e954685f2c_o.jpg">
<p>
Restored in 2010. The castle belonged to the Radziwills until the revolution of 1917, then it was destroyed, but a few years later Nesvizh came under Polish rule, and the prince returned the castle to himself. After the Second World War, the city became part of the USSR, and a sanatorium was located in the castle, as a result of which most of the decor was destroyed and restored only in the 21st century.

<h2>Gomel</h2>
<p>
The last regional center of Belarus where I had not been was Gomel, so on the way back I made a maneuver to go to Moscow by an indirect route: Minsk - Gomel - Novozybkov - Moscow. The center of Gomel is reminiscent of other Belarusian cities with Stalinist architecture in soft yellow and pink colors.

Built at the end of the 18th century. The image of the palace can be seen on Belarusian 20 ruble banknotes (each denomination of the banknote corresponds to one of the six regions of the country   the city of Minsk on the 500 ruble banknote).
