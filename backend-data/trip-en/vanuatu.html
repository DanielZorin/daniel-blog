<h1>Vanuatu</h1>
<i>17-19 January 2020</i>
<p>
Vanuatu is one of the most accessible countries in Oceania; flights from Australia are not very expensive, and there are flights to Fiji and New Caledonia too. The flight to New Caledonia is only a little over an hour, but the contrast is suddenly huge: Vanuatu is truly tropical with dense jungle.

<p>
I was on the capital island of Efate. All life is concentrated along the coast; the interior of the island is practically undeveloped.

You can see the hotel on the shore and the reef.

<p>
On the right you can see Hideaway Island - there is a small beach where tourists are taken without spending the night.

Individual plots are used for vegetable gardens, but not systematically - there are voids between them.

<p>
From here it is only 2-3 kilometers to the city center of Port Vila, the capital of Vanuatu.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255687206_6af3177d87_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Port Vila has surprisingly cheap hotels for Oceania. For less than $20, I rented a huge air-conditioned room in the heart of the city.

<p>
So, welcome to Vanuatu.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256437134_d1f8ae90bd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Port Vila is a small but lively city and has everything you need. In the very center there is a market, or rather two: a classic grocery market and a large supermarket of the Au Bon Marche chain. The selection of products in the supermarket is not as good as in New Caledonia, more like somewhere like Cambodia.
<p/>

<p>
Fruit and vegetable market.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256438649_da987df8a0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
They sell cabbage and greens.
<p/>

<p>
Watermelons are incredibly expensive - one watermelon costs around 20 dollars (the price must be divided by 100 to convert into dollars). But bananas and coconuts are cheap.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256734545_0742cd659e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
They also sell combo dishes: herring with fried banana for $2.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255892738_a93aff78e5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Chicken, sausage, greens and some local vegetable (taro or cassava?).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256438749_2918c75967_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Smeared chicken with something weird also costs 200 vatu.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256438774_370b2dffe7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Local money is beautiful and plastic, like in Australia and Canada.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256438594_ada74309cf_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Typical local fried chicken joint, combo is $5-$6.
<p/>

<p>
I found at least two such eateries in the center of Port Vila.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256437014_737aa62b5c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are also Chinese restaurants. The Chinese presence in Vanuatu is very significant, just like in <a href="../tonga">Tonga</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256437169_e4ef4b57b8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Most of the stores (both food stores and general stores) are run by the Chinese.
<p/>

<p>
There is also one modern fashionable shopping center in Port Vila, apparently recently built, because half the places inside were empty.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256437209_9571e47a6d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Outside the center there are large stores with equipment, electronics, etc.
<p/>

<p>
It’s interesting that streets here can be named after the supermarkets located on them.

<p>
Local residents drink kava instead of alcohol. Kava is a drink made from the roots of the plant of the same name. Its effect is a bit similar to that of cannabis.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255689141_8b345ddc05_h.jpg"/>
<p>
To prepare kava, you need to dilute the powder from the roots of the plant in water, and then squeeze it through cheesecloth into a glass. It tastes like you're drinking dirty water from a puddle.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256735035_39992336ca_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Kava in Vanuatu is considered strong - I drank only one bowl (100 grams), and this was enough to clearly feel the effect, whereas from, for example, 500 grams of beer I don’t feel the effect at all, that is, the speed of action of kava is comparable to vodka. The effect, however, quickly wears off - after 30-40 minutes. Later, in Samoa, I tried the local kava, but it no longer had the same effect.

<p>
For a long time Vanuatu a joint colony of England and France - both countries had their own administrations, and only a common court. Official signs are duplicated in English and French, but many people speak the local language called Bislama - a pidgin, simplified English. Almost all words are English, but they are written as they are heard, and not according to the rules of English spelling. To make it plural, add ol ("all") before the word. All prepositions are replaced by two: long - “in”, blong (from belong) - genitive case. Reading inscriptions in Bislama is a real pleasure. Several tens of thousands of people speak Bislama as their first language, mostly in Vanuatu's major cities.

Since Vanuatu was a colony, some people from here fought on the fronts of the world wars, and now they have an obelisk on a high hill in Port Vila.

There is an island in the bay with an expensive hotel, and ferries with tourists from there arrive at the market from time to time.

Social Advertising - Think before posting on Facebook. I wonder if in Vanuatu they also imprison you for reposting?

<p>
The bus system here is strange. It looks like there are a lot of minibuses driving around the city; if they are going approximately in the same direction that you need, then they will pick you up and take you to the point, even if this means making a small detour into some residential area. Traveling around Port Vila costs 150 vatu ($1.5), further out it is more expensive, and more importantly, it is more difficult to find a minibus that goes there.

I also went to see how the village lives. I didn’t dare go around the entire island, because there was no guarantee that, having reached far, I would be able to find transport in the opposite direction. I reached the village of Mele, which I saw from the plane. Off the coast there is the small island with the beach.

I walked to the next village, Melemaat. There was a cemetery along the road. In Vanuatu, the cemeteries are less colorful than in Tonga.

Near this village there is a small waterfall where tourists from cruise ships are taken. Entrance there costs as much as 20 dollars, which is disproportionately expensive. In general, in Vanuatu the contrast between regular prices and prices for excursions and other entertainment for tourists is very large; for example, taxis and car rentals also cost several times more than in Australia.
