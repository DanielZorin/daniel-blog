<h1>China: Kunming, Shilin, Shangri-La, Lijiang</h1>
<i>27 October - 1 November 2013</i>
<h2>Kunming</h2>
<p>
Many people are probably thinking, how can 1.3 billion people live on top of each other in China? The shocking truth is that China is much freer and more spacious than Russia. In Russia, people still live in communal apartments, Russia has the worst traffic jams in the world, and public transport is so crowded that in <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/284941.html">Tula</a > I could barely fit into the minibus standing bent over. And this is what an ordinary hotel room in China looks like (costs about 700 rubles / $20 per day).

A typical Kunming interchange. When you drive around the city by taxi in the evening, it seems that you are in Star Wars or another movie where spaceships fly in a city of the future.

<p>
Bus. There is a TV on the bus. I flew in from <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/296718.html">Shenzhen</a> in shorts and a T-shirt, and found myself dressed, to put it mildly, inappropriately for the weather; in Kunming, mittens were more appropriate .
<p/>

<p>
Kunming metro map. In fact, I did not find a long branch running from north to south. In reality, only the line at the top right, from the airport to the bus station, is operational, and the two intermediate stops marked on it are not yet open.

The interior of the carriages is slightly different from Guangzhou.

<p>
There are a surprising number of Soviet things preserved in Kunming. Here, for example, is an ultra-modern train station.

And the clock at the station looks like it came from the 60s.
<p/>

And not only at the station.

It seems that there is similar architecture in Moscow.

There is definitely one like this.

<p>
This is where I lived. By the way, at the entrance they were handing out stacks of business cards from prostitutes. In 2008, in Beijing, I collected a huge number of them, but this time I saw such a phenomenon only in Kunming.

At the bus station, as in any Russian city, there is a route map. From here buses go only to the west.

<p/>

There are houses here - analogues of Russian "Khrushchev" buildings, and cars are parked on the sidewalks.

<p/>

There is a market outside.

Kunming has unique street signs. Their columns seem to consist of dice.

In reality, after the Cultural Revolution, there was nothing left of old Kunming. There are several old style streets with restaurants and shops.

<h2>Stone Forest</h2>
<p>
The Stone Forest is an absolutely fantastic place, yet surprisingly empty. Maybe the rain played a role, because of it I had to clean the lens from drops every five minutes, but I doubt it, since most tourists come here on excursion buses, that is, their program is fixed in advance and does not change due to the rain. Groups of tourists are driven through one section of the park; the rest are so deserted that you can walk for half an hour and not see a single living soul, only huge stones.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255557666_1d71ec3383_o.jpg">
<p>
Entrance to the Stone Forest costs more than a thousand rubles (175 yuan), but this is the case when it is worth it. It costs another 25 yuan to take the minibus from the ticket office to the park entrance, although you can walk when the weather is better.

In general, the Stone Forest seems to extend far beyond the main park, so if you have a lot of time, you can find a lot of things in the area.

<h2>Shangri-La</h2>
<p>
Shangri-La is not Tibet yet, but it’s almost there. You don’t need to obtain special permits to travel here; you can get there by bus from the southeast. The city was renamed relatively recently to attract tourists. By Chinese standards, this city is microscopic, with a population of only 130 thousand. Let's see what a small city in China looks like.

<p>
The streets are full of souvenir shops. Interestingly, in this part of China there are no souvenirs in the European sense of the word. In any city in Europe there are a lot of T-shirts, mugs, pens, postcards, magnets and badges with the name of this city made in China, but in China itself you will not find a mug with the inscription “Shangri-La”.

<h2>Lijiang</h2>
<p>
Lijiang is probably the most tourist place in China if we compare the number of tourists with the city's population. 99.9% of tourists are Chinese, and this figure is not a figure of speech, there really is a thousand Chinese for every foreigner.

In Lijiang, the rule that 90% of tourists concentrate on 10% of the territory applies. Let's try to walk around the entire old city.
