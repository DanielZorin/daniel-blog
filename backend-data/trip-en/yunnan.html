<h1>China: Kunming, Shilin, Shangri-La, Lijiang</h1>
<i>27 October - 1 November 2013</i>
<h2>Kunming</h2>
<p>
Many people are probably thinking, how can 1.3 billion people live on top of each other in China? The shocking truth is that China is much freer and more spacious than Russia. In Russia, people still live in communal apartments, Russia has the worst traffic jams in the world, and public transport is so crowded that in <a href="../tula">Tula</a > I could barely fit into the minibus standing bent over. And this is what an ordinary hotel room in China looks like (costs about 700 rubles / $20 per day).

<p>
A typical Kunming interchange. When you drive around the city by taxi in the evening, it seems that you are in Star Wars or another movie where spaceships fly in a city of the future.
<p/>

<p>
Bus. There is a TV on the bus. I flew in from <a href="../guangdong">Shenzhen</a> in shorts and a T-shirt, and found myself dressed, to put it mildly, inappropriately for the weather; in Kunming, mittens were more appropriate .
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256324111_c1bab67c59_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Kunming metro map. In fact, I did not find a long branch running from north to south. In reality, only the line at the top right, from the airport to the bus station, is operational, and the two intermediate stops marked on it are not yet open.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256324001_c9648066fe_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The decor is typical.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257364445_47a9c05aff_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The interior of the carriages is slightly different from Guangzhou.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256521973_2d1decdfb5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are a surprising number of Soviet things preserved in Kunming. Here, for example, is an ultra-modern train station.
<p/>

<p>
And the clock at the station looks like it came from the 60s.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256772126_dab743b593_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And not only at the station.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257364520_c4f6e19eee_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It seems that there is similar architecture in Moscow.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256973013_7cac5c355b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is definitely one like this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256522008_731f3a091d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is where I lived. By the way, at the entrance they were handing out stacks of business cards from prostitutes. In 2008, in Beijing, I collected a huge number of them, but this time I saw such a phenomenon only in Kunming.

<p>
At the bus station, as in any Russian city, there is a route map. From here buses go only to the west.
<p/>

<p>
Let's take a look into the residential area.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255593962_e080f832ce_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are houses here - analogues of Russian "Khrushchev" buildings, and cars are parked on the sidewalks.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256324481_edcb66d05b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here the balconies are barred.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256324436_0aae00a41d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Communications are outside, there is barbed wire on the fence. Just like in <a href="../indonesia-3">Indonesia</a>!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257071344_ff09592228_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a market outside.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257071244_507355d28a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The market is everywhere.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257071219_8f76365dc1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It is omnipresent.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255593857_6aa6323946_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Let's return to the main streets.
<p/>

<p>
Buses whiz past with staggering frequency.

<p>
Kunming has unique street signs. Their columns seem to consist of dice.

The entrance to the main street is formally decorated with a gate (as in <a href="../washington">Washington</a>).
<p/>

Motorcyclists ride brazenly right through the crowd.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256324721_6247bc3714_c.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a map of old Kunming embossed in the central square.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257365005_abee9c367f_c.jpg"/>
<p>
In reality, after the Cultural Revolution, there was nothing left of old Kunming. There are several old style streets with restaurants and shops.
<p/>

<p>
Interior of a typical Chinese eatery. This one was not very good, the portions were too small.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256522618_dcaf4c3fef_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Music, music everywhere. A girl with a school bag sings songs.

<p>
And literally ten meters away the slow dancers are dancing.

<h2>Stone Forest</h2>
<p>
The Stone Forest is an absolutely fantastic place, yet surprisingly empty. Maybe the rain played a role, because of it I had to clean the lens from drops every five minutes, but I doubt it, since most tourists come here on excursion buses, that is, their program is fixed in advance and does not change due to the rain. Groups of tourists are driven through one section of the park; the rest are so deserted that you can walk for half an hour and not see a single living soul, only huge stones.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255557666_430dd2c29a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Entrance to the Stone Forest costs more than a thousand rubles (175 yuan), but this is the case when it is worth it. It costs another 25 yuan to take the minibus from the ticket office to the park entrance, although you can walk when the weather is better.
<p/>

<p>
Very narrow at times.

Only phones remind us of civilization from time to time.

<p>
The most beautiful section - here the path leads down, and the rocks from above almost close together.

This place is called the "immortal mushroom".
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254827752_92e76d3615_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In general, the Stone Forest seems to extend far beyond the main park, so if you have a lot of time, you can find a lot of things in the area.
<p/>

<p>
Interestingly, someone is cultivating the land right next to the Stone Forest. Probably, if you really want to, you can easily enter from this side without a ticket.

<h2>Shangri-La</h2>
<p>
Shangri-La is not Tibet yet, but it’s almost there. You don’t need to obtain special permits to travel here; you can get there by bus from the southeast. The city was renamed relatively recently to attract tourists. By Chinese standards, this city is microscopic, with a population of only 130 thousand. Let's see what a small city in China looks like.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255699948_cb9fc4b032_h.jpg"/>
<p>
For the first time I was traveling in a sleeper bus with beds. Before this, I either slept sitting or rode with a reclining seat.

Why wear a mask when there is clean mountain air around you, and there are almost no cars or exhaust fumes around?
<p/>

<p>
It's so cold here that wedding dresses are trimmed with fur. Shangri-La is located at an altitude of 3200 meters (although I did not experience any breathing problems).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254764287_87273d32cc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The most noticeable feature is that there are inscriptions in the minority language, Tibetan!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255699633_5044bd05d5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Even signs with street names are in Tibetan.

And also a masterpiece.

<p>
Let's take a look at the old city.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254764627_03d3f587db_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Tourists are mainly Chinese, although there are a few Europeans.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256243429_ada5ad47cd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The houses are mostly wooden.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256539605_9f6b28319c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The streets are full of souvenir shops. Interestingly, in this part of China there are no souvenirs in the European sense of the word. In any city in Europe there are a lot of T-shirts, mugs, pens, postcards, magnets and badges with the name of this city made in China, but in China itself you will not find a mug with the inscription “Shangri-La”.

<p>
In general, I would not say that the city is spoiled by tourists; there are relatively few of them here, and far from the main square there are none at all.
<p/>

Let's take a look at the outskirts of Shangri-La.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254765172_1c9a46ba8b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It seems that civilization has only just arrived here; they didn’t even have time to build proper roads.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254765272_b2a71d7b2b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But car services have already been built.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255495826_be9e53f737_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And there are cows grazing on the streets.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256540360_eac892bd3e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And pigs.
