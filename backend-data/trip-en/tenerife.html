<h1>Spain: Tenerife, Barcelona</h1>
<i>1-7 November 2018</i>
<h2>Puerto de la Cruz</h2>
<p>
On the island of Tenerife, I was based in the town of Puerto de la Cruz on the west coast - it was the most convenient place. There is a lot of accommodation there, since this is a tourist place, it is close to the airport, to the capital of the island, and there is a direct bus to the Teide volcano. Most tourists live on the south coast, where there are large hotels and sandy beaches, but I found it inconvenient - far from everything.
<p/>

<p>
Puerto de la Cruz also has a beach with black volcanic sand.

Most of the west coast consists of huge rocks like this.
<p/>

<p>
There are also very strong ocean waves and large breakwaters along the embankment.

<p>
Suddenly there are pyramids of stones, common for Buddhist countries like South Korea.
<p/>

<p>
There is a comfortable swimming pool near the shore; for a few euros you can hang out there.
<p/>

<p>
Along the coast there are serious medieval fortifications.

<p>
The city can be divided into upper and lower parts. At the top there is a highway, and there are more hotels (and they are cheaper), at the bottom there are small streets and trade.

There are really a lot of hotels, and there are also rooms in them. This is a very popular place.

It turned out that in Spain they grow dragonfruits, I thought they were common only in Southeast Asia.

<h2>San Cristobal de la Laguna</h2>
<p>
The historical capital of the island is the city of San Cristobal de La Laguna (or simply La Laguna). Its center is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255816778_06b40ee8f6_o.jpg">

<p>
La Laguna is not on the coast, but slightly inland.
<p/>

<p>
Externally, the city looks more like Mexico than mainland Spain. It is believed that this is the colonial style.

Also, straight streets, like in Mexican cities, instead of the traditional medieval labyrinths of Spain give the city some “coloniality”.

<h2>Santa Cruz de Tenerife</h2>
<p>
Santa Cruz is a port city and the capital of Tenerife. It is not as pretty as La Laguna, but there is also something to see.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256360779_44fc8848c3_o.jpg">

<p>
On the central square there is a gigantic monument - a cross to all those who died for their homeland. Not very typical for Spain.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254881937_4fa2b13c9f_o.jpg">
<p>
I would expect to see a monument in this style somewhere in Germany, if they erected monuments there (well, sometimes they do).

<h2>Teide</h2>
<p>
The juiciest place in Tenerife is the Teide volcano - the highest mountain in Spain. Teide is located in the middle of the island, on a high plateau. There is a public bus there once a day in the morning there and back in the evening, from Puerto de la Cruz, and from the south coast. The cable car takes you almost to the very top at a height of 3555 meters. You can’t just go higher; you have to get permission many months in advance.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256658890_8146a038a2_o.jpg">

<p>
Teide and the central part of Tenerife in general are almost always above the level of the clouds; at some point on the serpentine road you leave the cloud, and it remains below.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255818003_51f74ca0d7_o.jpg">

All that is behind the rocks are clouds; the sea is almost invisible.

My plan was to go down on foot - to see more than just the top (there are not many paths there). Going down is, of course, easier than going up, but it still wasn’t that easy.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256659130_b4a26796f2_o.jpg">
<p>
The fact is that the road is not a staircase, as in China or Nepal, but a path along stones, which means you need to always watch where you are stepping, carefully step between different stones.
<p/>

The final, longest part of the route in terms of mileage (but taking up 20-30% of the actual time) goes almost flat, with a slight slope.

<h2>La Orotava</h2>
<p>
If you go up from Puerto de la Cruz, you will find yourself in the city of La Orotava - the second historical city on the island after La Laguna.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256659660_820a34fb4f_o.jpg">

<p>
The city is on a steep hillside, so the streets are not that straight.

<h2>Barcelona</h2>
<p>
On the way back from the Canary Islands I had one evening in Barcelona. I didn’t really go anywhere except the center, and I also rented a hotel in the center. It turned out to be not so difficult to rent for one day in November; the room cost no more than 25 euros, and was located right in the Gothic quarter.
