<h2>Kazan</h2>
<p>
Kazan is the largest and most beautiful Potemkin village in Russia. Here, next to chic avenues and new buildings, there are real slums, like in Asian cities. Not old wooden houses, “private sector”, as, for example, in <a href="../nizhny-novgorod">Nizhny Novgorod</a>, but slums. Here, for example, is a house on the road from the main station to the Kremlin.

<p>
Step-by-step instructions on how to find slums. First we go out onto Bauman Street (this is the main street) and go towards the Kremlin. Suddenly there is a painted wall on the left, why not take a closer look at it?
<p/>

<p>
We go into the yard.

Voila!

They didn't even forget the barbed wire.

<p>
This can be seen in every second courtyard in the city center.

<p>
From time to time, houses are repaired, and where they cannot be repaired, they are covered with posters. This house has begun to be repaired.

In preparation for the Universiade, the government decided to relay all the tiles and asphalt in the city at once. As a result, the area looks like this a month before the opening of the Universiade (the Kremlin is behind).

<p>
Now for the good stuff. New areas are being built quickly. It's almost New York across the river.
<p/>

<p>
Soon Kazan will have an excellent embankment, like any self-respecting city on the Volga.

This building is not yet on Google Street View, or rather, it is at the initial stage of construction.

By the way, this is the Dalniy district where the police serve champagne. (<i>There was a scandal after a man died after being tortured anally with a chmpagne bottle by the policemen</i>). To get here, you need to take the metro to the final stop in the south.
<p/>

<p>
The stations on the board are marked on Google maps. Three new stations were opened literally two weeks before my visit to the city; their existence was indicated only on the line diagrams at the entrance; they did not have time to redo the carriages themselves and the platforms. They are not on this board either, the new stations are in the north, behind Kozya Sloboda.

On the fence of Kazan University its original name is still preserved - KIU (Kazan Imperial University).
<p/>

<p>
Now this university is named after its former student, who was expelled three months after admission (Lenin).

In Kazan, I visited inside a mosque for the first time. I’ve never been to a mosque before, even though I live a stone’s throw from the oldest mosque in Moscow. I know that this is not prohibited, you can even take pictures, but it’s somehow inconvenient to interfere with people’s prayers. For the same reason, I don’t like to go into Orthodox churches during services, but in the case of a church, I at least know how to behave in order to blend in with the crowd and not attract the attention and aggression of Orthodox activists.

However, when there is no prayer, tourists are not allowed into the main hall, you can only look at it from the balcony.

<h2>Sviyazhsk</h2>
<p>
Sviyazhsk is a village for 100 people, located on a picturesque island.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256621950_45cd2f152b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are branded lights here.

Near a very ancient wooden church stood a man who had clearly read “12 Chairs” and decided to trade for a view of the malachite puddle <i>In the novel, the protagonist sold tickets to a malachite cave that was free to enter, pretending to be an official ticket seller.</i>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254846592_10dd293cb8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
During Soviet times there was a concentration camp with mass executions here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255576461_6f29442981_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The guides tell an interesting story that Trotsky, being here in 1918 during the storming of Kazan, erected a monument to Judas Iscariot in Sviyazhsk as the first revolutionary in human history. It was approximately in this square. The story is very cool, although there are considerable doubts about its reliability: the episode is described only in two written sources, one of which no one has seen, and the second is unreliable.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256325709_dfec3ef3bf_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The monument to Judas is almost as cool as the monument to Hitler, which the great friend of the Soviet Union, Doctor of all Sciences, Idi Amin, wanted to erect in the center of Kampala.
</p>
<h2>Yoshkar-Ola</h2>
<p>
Yoshkar-Ola is a revolution of colors and a break of all patterns. A city that has no analogues in Europe. Of course, highbrow intellectuals, snorting and raising their noses, will say that this is all a tacky remake that has no artistic value, pandering to the tastes of the masses. But we will answer this in unison - isn't it better for people to be happy that they have the entire city center as an amusement park, and not a bunch of gray commieblocks and rickety shacks. In America, where there are almost no ancient buildings, they are not ashamed to build Disneyland and Las Vegas, but why are we worse?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255969668_3faec6e5fa_h.jpg"/>
<p>
First things first. At first Yoshkar-Ola was an unremarkable provincial town. There were no special attractions, except for one 18th century church. There were only broken roads.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255037487_ee2753703c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Even more broken roads.

<p>
There was also a Gulag museum here, located in the building where mass executions took place. The grandmother-caretaker told how her father was shot because he was reported out of jealousy, how dozens of people were sitting in the execution chamber. Now in the process of excavating the basement, where the executions actually took place in 1937, and then it was specially covered with earth. If you're in town, be sure to stop by.
<p/>

Let's make a street like in Belgium. And we’ll set up a registry office there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256810860_cfb0f6c221_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Opposite we will erect a monument to the Prince of Monaco and his wife. It will be much better than the registry office of the city of <a href="../nizhny-novgorod">Bor</a>
<p/>

<p>
In general, monuments to those for whom there are no monuments anywhere else are cool. Here is a monument to Empress Elizabeth.

Yoshkin cat (it's an exclamation of surprise in Russian). There is also this brand of vodka in Mari-El, I couldn’t resist and bought a bottle.
<p/>

<p>
Construction continues. What is still a little lacking here are cafes and other places where people gather. They are on the boulevard starting at the Spasskaya Tower, but in the new buildings themselves there are mainly institutions, so there are not many people. Some are still empty.
<p/>

<h2>Kugesi</h2>
<p>
Kugesi is a village of 10 thousand people near Cheboksary. It is famous for the fact that there is a motel there where you can stay for only 700 rubles, while in Cheboksary it is much more expensive. The disadvantage of this motel is that the shower is located on the street, so a strong-willed decision was made to move to Cheboksary on the second day. The sights of Kugesi are standard. Lenin monument:

Somewhere here there was a hotel, or rather a brothel, where we stayed. Although the rooms are rented by the hour, the place is generally comfortable and the sound insulation is normal. There is a shortage of inexpensive hotels in Cheboksary, so this is actually the best option.

In Cheboksary they thought of posting their names in large letters at bus stops. This makes it a million times easier for tourists to travel around the city; most likely, you won’t miss the right stop. Why didn’t other cities (except Perm) figure it out?

Almost all buildings have a warning about snow falling from the roof (as in Yaroslavl).

Chuvash cuisine. I don’t recommend “Kakay-shurpi”; it’s a soup made from liver, kidneys and other inedible things.

Yes, extracting money from the Vasyukinites is an almost impossible task. But once a year, during the Benderiad holiday, Kozmodemyansk transforms and the fun begins.
<i>Kozmodemyansk was the prototype of the fictional city of Vasyuki from the novel "The 12 chairs". The main character Bender is a genius swindler. In that chapter, he comes to Vasyuki and pretends to be a chess grandmaster, he promises to organize an international tournament in Vasyuki, which will bring an influx of tourists and money to the city, and eventually Vasyuki will be renamed New Moscow and become capital of the world.</i>

<p>
There are surprisingly few references to The 12 Chairs in the city. Vasyuki residents are not realizing their tourism potential. Where is the "Four Knights Club", the "Passed Pawn" hotel, the chessboards on the streets and the monument to Bender? There is only a small museum.

And a bonus - “Moscow” steak from the Kozmodemyansk cafe “Rus”, where, apparently, wealthy Vasyuki residents go out for their birthdays. Overall pretty good, I recommend it.
