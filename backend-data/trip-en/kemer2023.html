<p>
When I returned from the trip to Malaysia, it was already warm in Kemer, the best time to relax on the beach.

I have long wanted to review a supermarket in Turkey. But due to the depreciation of the lira, prices were constantly changing. At the end of December 2023, when I took photographs, the exchange rate had settled at around 28-29 liras per dollar for six months. In general, many complain that Turkey has become expensive compared to 2022. But this is not entirely correct; rather, spring-summer 2022 was abnormally cheap, since then the lira had just fallen, and prices in dollars were gradually rising. As a result, prices in dollars have now returned more or less to the level of 2019, which is still much cheaper than it was in the golden times around 2013, when I was in Turkey for the first time.
I will review the Migros supermarket closest to my home. This is not the cheapest supermarket, there are cheaper Bim and Sok, but in general it’s not that the prices are very different; in Migros there are more different options for each product.
<p/>

<p>
It is not always easy to understand what is what based on price tags. Especially in the vegetable department, even if you speak Turkish. In general, I rarely buy vegetables and fruits in the store; as a rule, I buy them at the market, since they are fresher, cheaper, and there is more choice. For example, there are no tangerines here, and in the market they cost only 10-15 liras. Tomatoes and cucumbers at the market cost 25-30 liras (in this store 35), and in the summer they were 15. Mushrooms cost 80 liras. Pepper 40-50.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53399639233_d18def4f4c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Potatoes cost 18 liras, garlic 95, onions only 7.50.
<p/>

<p>
Meat. Chicken fillet costs approximately 150 liras ($5) per kilogram. In this store there are actually fillets from different manufacturers, so you have to be careful, otherwise you may end up paying 200 instead of 150.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53399638553_153d48c82e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A whole chicken costs 50-70 liras per kilo (about $2).

In this refrigerator there are all sorts of minced meats, you can take minced meat or preparation for kebab or raw cutlets (kofte), for about 3-4 dollars per box (300-400 grams). There are also steaks that cost ~600 per kilo, but they are not available now.

On the left is a pack of the cheapest sausages - they cost 95 liras for a pack weighing a whole kilogram. On the right is the egg department, in which the last pack remains. In Turkey, eggs are often sold not by 10 or 12 (as in the USA), but by 15 or 30. 15 eggs cost 60 liras ($2).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53399638913_4e0a716fe8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Pork is not popular in a Muslim country, so a pack of regular cheap bacon costs $15 ($80 per kilo), twice as much as a steak.
<p/>

Activia yoghurts - 43 for 4 pieces, Danette without a promotion is about the same. By the way, to buy a product on sale, you need to have a discount card, which is sold for a couple of liras.

Toblerone costs some absolutely unimaginable money - more than $3, although I bought it at one time for about $1. The freebie time is over. Milka is also a bit expensive. But sometimes there are promotions for a dollar.

They sell lemonade from Georgia, a small bottle for $1.6. I love Georgian lemonades, so I take them regularly. Previously, I also ordered large bottles of a different brand (but also pear) for $1.5 per liter (I looked now, they are back on sale again). Though, they once brought me tarragon instead of pear. Dr. Pepper can also be ordered for delivery at approximately 50 liras per can.
