<h1>Russia: Yekaterinburg, Tyumen, Omsk, Krasnoyarsk</h1>
<i>30 December 2014 - 5 January 2015</i>
<h2>Yekaterinburg</h2>
<p>
I have long wanted to visit the capital of the Urals. This is a very advanced city, one of the few in Russia where there is a good modern panorama.
<p/>

<p>
The largest skyscraper, however, is not fully completed, and it looks like construction may freeze, as happened here in 2008.

"Vysotsky" was completed a long time ago and is still alive.
<p/>

<p>
Near Yekaterinburg there are such iconic places as Tagil and Chelyabinsk. Unfortunately, there wasn’t much time to travel around the Urals this time.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255756371_1f7a7e4de0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is simply a record amount of all kinds of street art in Yekaterinburg.
<p/>

And also just interesting inscriptions.

In Yekaterinburg there is a famous monument to the keyboard. In winter it was completely covered with snow.

One of the houses has a mosaic image of Buddha. No wonder, he was Russian.

And before, the house of the merchant Ipatiev itself stood, before it was demolished by the then head of Sverdlovsk, Yeltsin. The only monument to him in Russia is also here.

In a local store, I learned about the existence of the Elena Miro clothing brand. Oh, the irony: they sell clothes for not the most slender women. <i>At that time there was a popular fitness blogger Lena Miro</i>

The Yekaterinburg metro is a place where you can indulge in nostalgia. Such machines once hung in Moscow.
<p/>

<p>
Tokens in Moscow were replaced by cards in the late 90s. It turns out that they were not thrown out, but sent to Yekaterinburg.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255959543_9cdbaf4fb0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The metro has one line, but it goes through the center, train station and large residential areas, so it is very useful. Signs are in English.
<p/>

<p>
I celebrated 2013 in <a href="../curitiba">Curitiba</a> on the main square with a bottle of martini. 2014 - in <a href="../istanbul">Istanbul</a> with wine just brought from <a href="../cyprus">Cyprus</a>. To celebrate the New Year in Russia, “Putinka” was purchased, as well as cherry beer, “Perrier” water, the national Russian dish - “Rollton” noodles, “Olivier” salad and tangerines. Everything is canonical!

<p>
The next morning, on the train to Tyumen, for the first time in my life I saw a sleeper carriage, where 90% of the berths were empty.
<p/>
<h2>Tyumen</h2>
<p>
Siberia begins in Tyumen (although administratively it is the Ural Federal District). Siberia greeted us with a refreshing coolness of -27 degrees, as well as empty streets on the occasion of the first of January.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256415394_5f3be53e05_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You can walk in such cold weather.

Tyumen calls itself the best city on Earth.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256710850_ceade74495_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is no accident: the Tyumen region produces most of the Russian oil and gas. What other region in the world can boast such a key position?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255665596_d6e534c7d2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Tyumen has a gorgeous embankment near the Tura River.

<p>
And the private houses.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256711140_853dfb1104_h.jpg"/>
<p>
An important landmark of Tyumen is this house.

Very polite people live in Tyumen. Even on the walls of the bus stop they write not “dick”, but “all the best.”
<p/>

<p>
The main feature of Tyumen is hot springs with mineral water. From nearby cities there are many excursions for 1-2 days with swimming. Swimming in hot water when the air temperature is -30 is priceless. Your hair becomes covered with frost until you take a dip. There is steam above the pool (it's behind the houses). Real Siberian hardcore!

<h2>Omsk</h2>
<p>
When you know all the memes about Omsk and drug addiction, it is very difficult to remain serious in Omsk.

Well, what to do when the city itself gives you a reason?

Alena has been eating “Omichka” chocolate butter since childhood, not suspecting that this is the name given to a female resident of Omsk.

In Omsk, the adventures continued with walks in the cold -27 degrees. It turned out that you need to eat a hearty meal, otherwise you will freeze.
<p/>

There were few people on the streets, everyone was afraid of the cold or had not yet recovered from the holiday.

<p>
It seems to me that winter is the best time to travel to Omsk. In summer and especially in spring, here you can film the dirt and horrors that have been discussed many times in various blogs, and in winter everything is beautiful.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256795313_9d524359b9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In some places, Omsk is quite a beautiful old city.

The magnificent theater has been preserved.

The new theater was built in the shape of a springboard, unexpectedly cool for late Soviet architecture.
<p/>

In Omsk there are good information stands for tourists, with a map of the city.
<p/>

Yegor Letov (punk musician from the 1980's) is buried at the Staro-Vostochny cemetery in Omsk. Even in winter there are flowers on this grave, although they are covered with snow.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256795923_61132fca9a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In general, the cemetery is modest in Russian style.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256795898_a5f7e879cf_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At the entrance there is a stone dedicated to the victims of political repression.
<p/>

<h2>Krasnoyarsk</h2>
<p>
Everything has changed in Krasnoyarsk. It suddenly became warmer, the temperature was -10. Immediately when you get off the train you can see why you need to go to Krasnoyarsk.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257340340_7d816ddac4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Krasnoyarsk is very worth a visit due to its gorgeous nature. This is a rare case when in Russia an AAA  place is easy, quick and inexpensive to get to. There are two more - <a href="../vladikavkaz">Elbrus</a> and <a href="../kaliningrad">Curonian Spit</a>. The fact is that on the outskirts of Krasnoyarsk there is the Krasnoyarsk Pillars nature reserve.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256299516_588f0bc2e1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are two ways to get there. Actually, the bus goes to the main entrance. The downside of this option is that from the main entrance to the first pillars, the walk is about 7 kilometers, that is, at least an hour. At the end you still have to go back the same way. We were not sure that with our equipment and experience in cold weather we would be able to do this, especially since there was nowhere to warm up in the reserve, there were no cafes (logical, it’s a reserve!). Therefore, you can use the second option: get off a few stops earlier and go to the Bobrovy Log fun park.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257340490_d3453028f0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Funpark is just a ski resort, there are slopes for skiing, and there is also a chair lift from which you can go up, which is cool in itself. The lift works if the temperature is above -25, that day it was just -20.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255568842_a2608b67cb_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257809575_7871a0d39d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
From above you can see the panorama of Krasnoyarsk, although the center is a bit far away. But even in this photo you can see the small chapel that is depicted on the 10 ruble banknote.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257340555_770c9755ce_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Then there are two ways. If you go left, you will end up on the Takmak rock. It seems like it’s not far to go, so going there is the lightest version of Pillars. But we are not looking for easy ways, so we go to the right. There, behind the wooden gates, the actual territory of the reserve begins. In about 10 minutes you can walk to the equipped observation deck.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255569122_922c134ba5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
From the site you can already see some pillars, but the bulk is further away. And here’s the trick: from the observation deck to the group of central pillars it’s a closer walk than from the main entrance; we walked back without stopping in about 40 minutes, i.e. there are about 3-4 kilometers there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257340880_0fce3705ad_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It is difficult to get lost in the park, at least in winter the well-trodden path is clearly visible, and other people periodically appear. In some places the trail is marked with small traces of paint on the trees.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257046199_24b54af076_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is taiga here, its own atmosphere. Although it was not very hot, it was easy to walk.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256767201_bca14da12c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And here are the pillars!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256299411_d45fc1d73b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
We even conquered one of them, the simplest one.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256497778_8adb455f3e_h.jpg"/>

<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256497623_2920748d32_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I think it is better to visit the pillars in winter than in summer. After all, in the summer there are, firstly, mosquitoes and midges. Secondly, if it rains even a little, it will greatly spoil the walk, and in winter only if there is a very severe blizzard.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257046469_8450779a09_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The main disadvantage of winter is that it gets dark early. It's time to go back.
