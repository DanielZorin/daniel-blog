<i>30 June - 8 July 2016</i>
<h2>Kandy</h2>
<p>
The first city in a new country is the place where you absorb the most information. In Sri Lanka, the first city for me was Kandy, if we don't count the village near the airport where I spent the night after arriving. It is a large and fairly typical city for the country.
<p/>

<p>
Sri Lanka is a former British colony, this is immediately apparent from the clock towers in the central squares.
<p/>

<p>
There is a single numbering of buses throughout the country, and there are no differences between local and intercity ones. The design of the sign above the windshield is uniform.
<p/>

<p>
Everything is fine with fruit. There are even local durians and mangosteens. The strange fruit “elephant apple,” which I tried once in Cambodia and once in Thailand, comes from these lands and is sold here in every stall.
<p/>

<p>
Soursop is also common.
<p/>

<p>
Surprisingly, they sell “brick” bread here, although I was sure that this was a typical Russian delicacy! The crust is just as crispy.
<p/>

<p>
In the city there are confectionery shops with a non-trivial assortment.
<p/>

<p>
The fleet has been decommissioned from all over the world. On the truck there is an inscription in Japanese “Natural gas vehicle, environmentally friendly”.

<p>
Copy center. Very inexpensive - for one dollar you can photocopy as many as 70 pages! For some reason, printing is twice as expensive. In Russia, as far as I know, you cannot find cheaper than 2 rubles (3 cents) per page, even in the provinces, unless we are talking about printing several thousand pages. And it’s very difficult to print one page for less than 10 rubles.
<p/>

<p>
The poorer the country, the more elite the fast food chains there will be. Sri Lanka is a very poor country, here KFC prices are at the level of an expensive restaurant.
<p/>

Prices at Burger King. A Whopper costs 600 rupees = more than 4 dollars, in Russia it is half the price.
<p/>

In the underground passages they sell from stalls.

Buddha's tooth is kept here.It seems that all parts of the poor Buddha’s body are stored somewhere around the world.

The local mad king ordered a huge lake to be dug in the middle of the city, thereby ruining his country and bringing it to occupation. But the lake remains.

Near the lake you can observe a variety of fauna: waterfowl...

<h2>Sigiriya</h2>
<p>
The top attraction of Sri Lanka is Sigiriya (although I would not call it widely known, even I had not heard of this place before I was planning to visit Sri Lanka). This is a huge stone on which a royal palace stood a thousand years ago. Now, it seems, only the foundation remains of it, and the entrance ticket costs as much as 30 dollars - until recently, even <a href="../angkor">Angkor</a> was cheaper.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256257974_91e0aa789a_o.jpg"  >
<p>
I did not go inside, but headed around Sigiriya along the perimeter of the square moat.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254778987_0fb05d7e46_o.jpg"  >
<p>
On the other side are the remains of the wall.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254779022_d542216c8c_o.jpg"  >
<p>
In many places the moat is interrupted, you can get closer to the rock, but tickets are still checked at the entrance.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256553895_e1677ceee4_o.jpg"  >
<p>
They say there are wild elephants walking here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256553920_b427daa4c5_o.jpg"  >
<p>
A kilometer north of Sigiriya there is another huge rock where you can also climb.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256553935_40cc6c3264_o.jpg"  >
<p>
Entrance here costs only 3 dollars.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255714023_db0646f469_o.jpg"  >
<p>
Under the stone is a Buddhist temple with a Buddha statue.

<p/>

<p/>

The scenery at the top looks cool. On a bare rock there is a mound of earth from which trees grow.

At the entrance there is a map of the world painted on the wall. It looks like it was drawn a long time ago - the USSR and Yugoslavia still exist on it.

<h2>Dambulla</h2>
<p>
I used this village as a base for traveling around northern Sri Lanka.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257091670_f9a9451edd_o.jpg"  >
<p>
There is also a large temple with Buddha here, but otherwise it is a small village.

<h2>Vavuniya</h2>
<p>
For decades Sri Lanka was ravaged by the civil war that ended relatively recently. In the north of the island, the Tamils tried to secede. Tamils came to Sri Lanka from southern India during the British colonization. The indigenous Sinhalese Buddhists did not really like the Hindu Tamils, and the confrontation resulted in a war. Although the Tamils are in a clear minority, they managed to keep the north of the island under control for quite a long time. Now the Tamil separatists have been defeated. The front line passed near the city of Vavuniya.
Vavuniya can be seen as an example of an average Sri Lankan city without tourists.

Near the bus station there is a classic clock tower.

Tamil Hindu temples from southern India are characterized by a lot of statues in the shape of a pyramid.

Signs in this part of the country are duplicated in three languages. In the south, Tamil is not used everywhere.

<h2>Mihintale</h2>
<p>
I didn’t want to pay $25 for a ticket to Anuradhapura, there were no cheap hotels there, so I just went to the neighboring town of Mihintale, 15 kilometers to the east, where there are also Buddhist stupas and ruins, but the entrance is only $3.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255710952_6f14537801_o.jpg"  >

At the foot of the hill, only the foundations remained.
<p/>

Instead of going straight to the stupa, you can go in the opposite direction to the nearby high hill.
<p/>

<h2>Курунегала</h2>
<p>
I was passing through this city, changing from one bus to another. Here in the city center there is also a huge stone with a Buddha statue.

<h2>Negombo</h2>
<p>
Due to some misunderstanding, this city is considered a resort. There is absolutely no beach here, and it’s also a bit expensive.

<p>
It is curious to know that in Sri Lanka, many hotels do not allow Sri Lankans themselves; they say that some of them do not know how to behave. In China and India, on the contrary, many hotels do not allow foreigners.

<h2>Colombo</h2>
<p>
The capital, Colombo, is perhaps the most interesting city in Sri Lanka, but it is rarely visited by tourists, because there is an airport in Negombo, beaches in the south, and there is somehow no cheap housing in Colombo. However, it is full of majestic English architecture, cheap food, and a wide selection of markets.

<h2>Hikkaduwa</h2>
<p>
Hikkaduwa is a resort where tourists from Russia like to settle. The sea here is nicer than in Negombo, I didn’t even disdain to swim, although the waves are strong and the water is muddy, it’s better to surf here than swim.

Galle is a walled city in the south of Sri Lanka. Built by the Dutch, a very interesting place.
