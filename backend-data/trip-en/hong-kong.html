<h2>Hong Kong</h2>
<p>
On the one hand, Hong Kong is not quite China. They have separate passports, border controls and migration policies, their own currency, and no communism. On the other hand, Hong Kong is much more similar to stereotypical China than Chinese cities themselves: huge crowds of people on the streets, cramped conditions, shacks mixed with tall apartment buildings.

<p>
The hallmark of Hong Kong are the skyscrapers on the island of the same name, Hong Kong. The view from Victoria Peak is somewhat strange: usually skyscrapers are always viewed from below, not from above.

<p>
Since a visa is not required for Hong Kong, there are many more tourists here than in mainland China. From Russia as well.
<p/>

<p>
The best view is from the Avenue of Stars on the mainland. The area is called Kowloon, or Jiulong in standard Chinese. Hong Kong, by the way, is called Xianggang in Chinese; the English and Russian names come from the local language, Cantonese, which is officially considered a dialect of Chinese.
<p/>

<p>
Kowloon also has its own skyscrapers. On the left is a typical Hong Kong navigation. It’s impossible to get lost in Hong Kong, even if you don’t know a word of English or Chinese (by the way, not everyone in Hong Kong speaks English; most people in the markets don’t). On almost every corner there are maps of the area, where all the buildings and underground passages are marked.
<p/>

Hong Kong Island is built very thoroughly, on several levels. If you want to walk several metro stops, a significant part of the route will take place along elevated pedestrian crossings and passages between buildings.
<p/>

<p>
There is very little space and the hills start quickly. The roads are two-level.
<p/>

<p>
At the same time, there are no traffic jams in Hong Kong.
<p/>

<p>
The upper levels of the hill can be reached by escalators and stairs. In the morning, some escalators only work downwards.

Car traffic here is not so dense.

<p>
Here it is - ideal of infill development. Houses with 20-30 floors are crammed onto every available piece of land. The result is thin towers 1-2 apartments wide.

There are no such hills in Kowloon, so it is freer there. You can walk on the sidewalks.
<p/>

On this occasion, a brisk trade takes place on the sidewalks.

Hong Kong has its own Times Square. That's exactly what it's called. Neon advertising is present, although there is less of it than in New York.

The coolest thing about Times Square is the multi-story shopping mall that looks impressive from below.

With such a pace of construction, there is almost nothing left of the British in Hong Kong. Sometimes familiar outlines are recognized.

<p>
Away from the center, where there is still quite a lot of space, they do not suffer from infill development; large elite blocks are being built immediately according to standard designs.

Now let's see what Hong Kong's tall buildings look like from the inside. I had the opportunity to live in two - in the Mongkok area and in the famous Chungking mansion.
<p/>

View from the balcony. Between many houses there are narrow, inconspicuous passages and alleys. At night they are not illuminated, but there is some kind of movement there.

<p>
Chungking Mansion is Hong Kong's most famous slum skyscraper. A huge building consisting of several buildings is almost entirely rented out as hotels. This is practically the cheapest housing in Hong Kong, costs about 1400-1500 rubles ($50) for a double room. The rooms are 3 by 2 meters in size, two beds, a narrow strip between them, a couple of bedside tables and a shower with an area of 1 square meter, combined with a toilet, somehow fit in. In principle, it’s quite normal, clean, the furniture is new. The main thing is that the air conditioner works properly, there is fast Internet, and that the shower is fenced off with a blank wall and not tinted glass. The floors look quite presentable.

<p>
But the back staircase - not so much. It is more convenient to use the stairs, since the elevators are small and there is often a queue for them.

Mostly Indians and Pakistanis hang out in this building. On the ground floors there is a shopping center where you can change currency and buy fake iPhones. At the entrance there is always a crowd of Hindus offering to rent a room to everyone who enters. They didn’t offer drugs, although I heard they have them too.

To the right of the entrance, behind the newspaper shop, there is a passage between the buildings. If you don't look closely, you won't notice.

China has its own special visual culture, which is not similar to Europe. Here they really like to explain all sorts of rules with pictures. Here is a very interesting example: “do not put your feet on the seat opposite”, a sign on a bus where the seats are placed in fours facing each other. The illustration shows a board for playing Xiangqi (Chinese chess). Half of the board is visible, on which the red pieces initially stand, and there is a black bishop on it, which according to the rules cannot be, because bishops cannot enter the opponent's half of the board.

In the metro, all exits are marked with letters; from the information, you can understand which exit is near what you need, and go there right away.

All types of public transport can be paid for with an Octopus card. The motivation for using it is the fact that they do not give cash change on buses. Sometimes you can also find poles where you can press an Octopus card to get a couple of Hong Kong dollars off your next trip.

The inscriptions on the road surface are interesting. They seem to be elongated so that the driver from the car sees them at normal height, and not flattened.

Although Hong Kong is associated with skyscrapers, oddly enough, most of the territory of this special administrative region is undeveloped, there are jungles and fishing villages. These are mainly new territories north of Kowloon to the Chinese border and various islands. Here is the island of Cheung Chau.
