<h1>Switzerland: Basel, Laufenburg</h1>
<i>19 January 2018</i>
<h2>Basel</h2>
<p>
For the second time in a row I am visiting Switzerland for one day without an overnight stay. The city of Basel is located right on the triple border with France and Germany; from Germany you can get here using German travel cards without additional payment.
By the way, catch this life hack - there are many trains that travel from Germany deep into Switzerland: to Bern or even Geneva. If you buy a ticket in advance on the website, then for a specific train on a specific date you can usually get a promotional ticket for 20 euros, from Germany to, say, Bern ( 2 hours of travel). And then you can just board in Basel and go to Bern, which will be cheaper than just a Basel-Bern ticket, because according to Swiss tariffs such a trip will cost 50 euros.

<p>
Basel station is similar to Stuttgart and Helsinki stations, with the same Nordic features.

<p>
This, however, is a “German” station, where trains from Germany arrive. There is also a "Swiss" station on the other side of the center.

It's amazing that ferries across the river are still preserved here. To prevent the boats from being carried away, they are tied to a rope on the right.

As we know, Switzerland is an expensive country. Let's take a look at the prices at a local supermarket. This is a Coop store, not high-end but not the cheapest, in the center of Basel. Prices are quoted in Swiss francs, which are almost equal to US dollars. Apples, for example, are $4 per kilo - in the USA, it seems, it’s still a little more expensive.
<p/>

<h2>Laufenburg</h2>
<p>
An hour's drive from Basel is the town of Laufenburg. It is interesting because it is divided by a river and the state border into two parts - German and Swiss.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256347726_03d2877d2b_o.jpg">
<p>
Since I had an unlimited travel pass for Baden-Württemburg, I traveled to Laufenburg along the Rhine River line in Germany. The Swiss line from Basel runs literally parallel to it. The German station is located on a hill.

Usually in such places there are signs like “Germany” and “Switzerland”, but here, in order not to spoil the historical appearance of the bridge, they were made invisible. This statue stands exactly in the middle.
