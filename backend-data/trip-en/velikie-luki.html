<h1>Russia: Velikiye Luki, Dno</h1>

<h2>Velikiye Luki</h2>
<p>
The city of Velikiye Luki was fortunately located on the way from Vitebsk to St. Petersburg. Otherwise, I would hardly have gotten there, because even to the regional center of Pskov it’s a four-hour drive from there.

There are several versions of the etymology of the name. In modern Russian "luki" means either "onions" or "longbows". The etymologies connect the name with river bends ("izLUCHina"), meadows or even apostle Luke. None of them is associated with longbows, but they are depicted on the coat of arms.
