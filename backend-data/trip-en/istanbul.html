<h1>Turkey: Istanbul, Edirne</h1>
<i>25-26, 31 December 2013, 1-5 January 2014</i>
<h2>Istanbul</h2>
<p>
It's hard to say what Istanbul is like. It is similar to many things (no wonder it stands on the border of two parts of the world) and this, in a sense, makes it unique. The sights of Istanbul are so well known that I will not dwell on them, but will go over the main urban planning and infrastructure issues.
<p/>

<p>
Istanbul is approximately equal in population to Moscow, and this is very well felt. In the underground passage you can see a picture familiar to Muscovites of a collapse in the metro during rush hour.

<p>
In general, a significant part of the center consists of bazaars. For tourists there is the Grand Bazaar, where they will quote you ten times the price and sell you at double it. I hate haggling more than anything in the world.
<p/>

<p>
Fortunately, bargaining is out of place in normal Istanbul bazaars.

Russian shuttle traders purchase goods further south, in the area of the Laleli tram station.

There are inscriptions in Russian, but not very many. Rubles are accepted at exchange offices without any problems.

Eating in the center of Istanbul was a challenge, although I expected everything to be cheap. Due to the influx of tourists, all restaurants in the center raise prices to quite European levels. But in poorer areas you can find real Turkish establishments where they don’t speak English. Here, for example, is a canteen, where you can eat with the workers for 100 rubles ($3). It is located in a poor area with migrants, you need to go south from the Beyoglu station down the hill.

<p>
There are quite a few such areas. I lived in three different hotels in Istanbul, among the cheapest, so I saw all this all the time. I lived in the poorest area, north of Taksim Square, for the first time.

<p>
This place is even noted in guidebooks as unsafe at night. There were always some men warming themselves outside by the fire and reacting badly to the camera.

But what a view from the bathroom window!

<p>
The view from the roof of the second hotel (next to the aforementioned canteen) is even better.

In general, in Istanbul, panoramic views from afar are not as impressive as they are up close.

<p>
Another interesting area is located on the slopes of a hill under the central square (the one where Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque are), I accidentally wandered there on the very last day.

In general, Istanbul can be very different, there are also wooden houses.
<p/>

I haven’t explored the Asian part yet, but it’s also colorful there.

The Istanbul bus station is like a separate city within the city. It is so huge that you can get lost in it.
<p/>

<p>
I must say that the sale of tickets there is a mess, much like in <a href="../paraguay">Paraguay</a>, tickets are issued by hand next to the bus.
<p/>

The metro is not here.

<p>
Istanbul has an indecently small number of metro stations and lines for such a large city. Apparently due to the difficult terrain and water barriers. There is only a tram in the center, and there is a metro to the airport (the main one). Buses in Istanbul are quite good, there is a board with a list of the nearest stops. From Sabiha airport I took an hour and a half bus ride to the pier, there were about 70 stops. Travel by public transport costs about 30 rubles ($1) using a smart card, there are single use tokens for 45 rubles ($1.5). Because money for the smart card can be returned (with some deduction), tokens are unprofitable starting from a couple of trips, especially considering that transfers in Istanbul are not free, although the second and further trips within 90 minutes are cheaper (cost 20 rubles/$0.65).

The main idol of Turkey is Ataturk, there are monuments to him in every city. You cannot criticize Ataturk publicly, there is a criminal article for that.

To combat illegal traffic in Istanbul, there are special spikes that allow the car to go only in one direction.

For some reason, they collect bottle caps in a special container.

Istanbul immediately won my favor because cats are held in much higher esteem here than dogs. These houses are for cats.

Istanbul is very interesting, you can walk here for many, many days.

<h2>Edirne</h2>
<p>
I wanted to look at least a little at the Turkish province, so I went to the city of Edirne (Adrianople) with a population of 130 thousand. I vaguely remembered from my history course about the Treaty of Adrianople, which ended one of the wars between Russia and Turkey. At the beginning of the 20th century, the city changed hands during the Balkan Wars, and as a result, it is now located at the junction of the borders of Turkey, Bulgaria and Greece. However, there is no public transport across the borders, so going to Bulgaria without a taxi is problematic. From Istanbul to Edirne it takes three hours by bus.
<p/>

I found myself in the square with the Ataturk monument.

<p>
The main attraction of Edirne is this mosque (UNESCO monument). There are tourists, but quite few, especially in contrast to Istanbul.

I arrived at prayer time and there were a lot of people inside. Because there are few tourists, entry, unlike Istanbul, is not limited.

On the main street, according to Eastern tradition, there is trade and activity.
<p/>

<p>
There are many sculptures in Edirne; the style looks more like Europe than Asia. Well, Edirne itself is geographically certainly located in Europe.

The station is abandoned and dilapidated. Now trains do not run there (temporarily, renovations are underway), but once upon a time it was one of the stops of the Orient Express.
