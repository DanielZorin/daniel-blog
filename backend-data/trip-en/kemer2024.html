<h1>Turkey: Kemer</h1>
<i>1 January - 11 September 2024</i>
<h2>Kemer</h2>
<p>
In the first half of 2024, I spent quite a lot of time in Kemer - almost 5 months, minus trips to South Africa and France. The winter was even warmer than in 2023, I almost didn't even turn on the heaters.
<p/>

This is what Kemer looked like on a normal day in January.

At the end of March, there were regional and local elections, in Turkey they are held simultaneously in all cities of the country. In February-March, campaign buses were constantly driving around the city. There was much less of this during the presidential elections, since the candidates were apparently well known anyway.
<p/>

<p>
There were many candidates, not just one or two campaigners.

This is the current mayor of Kemer, who was eventually re-elected for a second term.

<p>
And this is a former mayor who has already ruled three times: in 1994-1999, and then in 2009-2019. Interestingly, he was in the CHP (one of the two main parties, the main opposition to Erdogan, and in the 1990s - the ruling party), and now he has rolled over to the nationalist Iyi parti. The slogan: "Love will win!"

<p>
There were also more local elections - here is a candidate for the post of head of the Camyuva district administration. A more modest campaign - by car instead of a bus.

My mother came to visit me at the beginning of June. I looked from the inside at a hotel in Kemer where package tourists stay. Tours here are cheap, only about $500 for 11 days, including a flight from Moscow. Three meals a day are included.
<p/>

<p>
You can't get it that cheap on your own, just the hotel costs at least $30 a day, and one kebab is already around $10. Hotel pool:

I said goodbye to an old friend: I bought this backpack before leaving for Asia at the end of 2014. I traveled with it until 2023. Twice I packed all the things I needed for life in it.

I visited the hospital. There are three large hospitals in Kemer - two private ones in the very center and a state one a little further away, on the bypass road.

They started selling ultra-cheap dragonfruit at the market for only 10 lira. Usually one costs 60 lira. Here they are small, of course, but far from 6 times smaller than usual.

In Aspava, Adana kebab in September already cost 280 lira. From July 2023 to September 2024, the lira exchange rate has hardly changed, and prices have doubled, especially for services (but also for goods, beef for example started to cost around 1000 lira).

A new fence has been built around Phaselis, but not all the way, and you can still enter/exit for free near the cliffs. I actually paid for the ticket, but I didn't want to go back to the main entrance, so I went straight out onto the road.
