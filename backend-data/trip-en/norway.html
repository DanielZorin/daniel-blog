<h1>Norway: Drammen, Oslo</h1>
<i>21 April 2012</i>
<h2>Drammen</h2>
<p>
I arrived in Oslo at 5 am, and, horrified by the number of multicultural emigrants at the central station, splurged on $20 and bought a train ticket to Drammen, which takes half an hour. The city of Drammen did not impress me with the colorful balls.

<p>
I wasn’t impressed by the wavy bench either.
<p/>

<p>
Not impressed with the signs.
<p/>

<p>
And a view of the main street.
<p/>

<p>
But I was impressed by the openness and friendliness of the local ghost residents, who not only don’t lock the doors to the barn, but don’t even have doors at all.

<p>
I was impressed by the broken asphalt and puddles on the sidewalk.
<p/>

<p>
And gasoline prices almost $3 per liter.
<p/>

<p>
But overall it’s a normal city.
<p/>

<p>
There is also free Wi-Fi throughout the city, the password for which can be obtained via SMS.

<p>
It's time to put aside fear and return to the capital of Norway.
<p/>
<h2>Oslo</h2>
<p>
Norway is what Russia could be if the population were 10 times smaller and less than 90% of oil revenues were embezzled. Despite this, to be honest, I would not like to live in Norway. Perhaps my reaction is similar to the reaction of the hero of this famous statue in Oslo, well, judge for yourself.

<p>
The view of the capital is, to put it mildly, not impressive.
<p/>

<p>
The tiles are laid only on the central pedestrian street.
<p/>

<p>
There are about five traffic lights at each intersection, and some have duplicate colors. It feels like someone wants to think for me.

<p>
One Templar knight, crazy from idleness, probably didn’t like it either. Now one of the central streets of Oslo looks like this.
<p/>

<p>
He also didn’t like these types of views on the streets.

<p>
And a Somali language textbook in a bookstore (try to find one in Moscow, and here it’s even in Norwegian).
<p/>

<p>
Typical Norwegian.
<p/>

<p>
Typical Norwegian hipster.
<p/>

<p>
They are fooling around nearby.
<p/>

<p>
The most crazy thing is coming.

<p>
Norway is a satellite of the United States, and American propaganda campaigns echo here. Yeah, Bin Laden, Hitler and Kony. Homer, Milton and Panikovsky.

<p>
Toilet in the central square. Speaking of toilets. Going to the toilet is the cheapest pleasure in Norway, costing only about $2. Everything else, starting from a piece of bread, will cost at least 4. The cheapest meal at McDonald's is almost $20.
<p/>

<p>
A residential area within walking distance from the center.

<p>
Prosperous Norwegians live here. Pay attention to the asphalt.
<p/>

<p>
Brrrrr. No, this is not Rio de Janeiro. I already have this view from my window in Moscow.
<p/>

<p>
Now a little about the good stuff. There is a simply gorgeous bookstore in Oslo (if you don't pay attention to the prices).
<p/>

<p>
Cool educational statues.
<p/>

<p>
Well, there is a park with sculptures, a truly unusual place that definitely deserves a visit.
<p/>

<p>
Whoa!
<p/>

<p>
Hurray, we scored a goal!
<p/>

<p>
Go to hell, all of you!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257643365_6b1214db0e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And you too!
<p/>

<p>
That's it, I'm leaving fucking Norway, grabbing my hair!
