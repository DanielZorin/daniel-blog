<h1>Norway: Drammen, Oslo</h1>
<i>21 April 2012</i>
<h2>Drammen</h2>
<p>
I arrived in Oslo at 5 am, and, horrified by the number of multicultural emigrants at the central station, splurged on $20 and bought a train ticket to Drammen, which takes half an hour. The city of Drammen did not impress me with the colorful balls.

<p>
I wasn’t impressed by the wavy bench either.
<p/>

<p>
Not impressed with the signs.

<p>
And a view of the main street.
<p/>

<p>
But I was impressed by the openness and friendliness of the local ghost residents, who not only don’t lock the doors to the barn, but don’t even have doors at all.

<p>
I was impressed by the broken asphalt and puddles on the sidewalk.
<p/>

<p>
And gasoline prices almost $3 per liter.
<p/>

<p>
But overall it’s a normal city.
<p/>

<p>
There is also free Wi-Fi throughout the city, the password for which can be obtained via SMS.

It's time to put aside fear and return to the capital of Norway.
<p/>
<h2>Oslo</h2>
<p>
Norway is what Russia could be if the population were 10 times smaller and less than 90% of oil revenues were embezzled. Despite this, to be honest, I would not like to live in Norway. Perhaps my reaction is similar to the reaction of the hero of this famous statue in Oslo, well, judge for yourself.

<p>
The view of the capital is, to put it mildly, not impressive.
<p/>

<p>
The tiles are laid only on the central pedestrian street.

<p>
There are about five traffic lights at each intersection, and some have duplicate colors. It feels like someone wants to think for me.

<p>
One Templar knight, crazy from idleness, probably didn’t like it either. Now one of the central streets of Oslo looks like this.

He also didn’t like these types of views on the streets.

<p>
And a Somali language textbook in a bookstore (try to find one in Moscow, and here it’s even in Norwegian).
<p/>

Typical Norwegian.

<p>
Typical Norwegian hipster.

<p>
They are fooling around nearby.

The most crazy thing is coming.

<p>
Norway is a satellite of the United States, and American propaganda campaigns echo here. Yeah, Bin Laden, Hitler and Kony. Homer, Milton and Panikovsky.

Toilet in the central square. Speaking of toilets. Going to the toilet is the cheapest pleasure in Norway, costing only about $2. Everything else, starting from a piece of bread, will cost at least 4. The cheapest meal at McDonald's is almost $20.

<p>
A residential area within walking distance from the center.

Prosperous Norwegians live here. Pay attention to the asphalt.

Brrrrr. No, this is not Rio de Janeiro. I already have this view from my window in Moscow.

Now a little about the good stuff. There is a simply gorgeous bookstore in Oslo (if you don't pay attention to the prices).
<p/>

Cool educational statues.
<p/>

<p>
Well, there is a park with sculptures, a truly unusual place that definitely deserves a visit.
<p/>

<p>
Whoa!

Hurray, we scored a goal!

Go to hell, all of you!

And you too!

That's it, I'm leaving fucking Norway, grabbing my hair!
