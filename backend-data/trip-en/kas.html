<h1>Turkey: Finike, Kaş, Kalkan, Kınık</h1>
<i>2-3 April 2022</i>
<h2>Finike</h2>
<p>
On my first weekend trip from Kemer I went to Kaş. You can get there by direct bus from Antalya, catching it in Kemer, but it doesn’t go that often, so I first got to the city of Finike along the route where buses go every half hour, and at the same time looked around Finike.

Beautiful view from the restaurant where the bus stops for a break.

<p>
Finike is not the most popular tourist town in this region and is usually passed through in transit.

The city is small.

There is quite a bit of old architecture.

One of the most picturesque sections of the road is between Finike and the next town Demre.

<h2>Kaş</h2>
<p>
Kaş is a small city in the very south of Antalya province. It is not close to the nearest airports (Antalya and Dalaman) - about 200 kilometers each, so, probably, there are no large all-inclusive hotels here, and in this way it resembles a small European resort town. For some reason, many expats and IT workers come to Kaş to work remotely (especially in the spring of 2022), so the cost of monthly rent here is noticeably higher than in other cities.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52036030862_68e23d1de6_o.jpg">

<p>
The road to Kaş is long and winding.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52036031297_14e3dc31c7_o.jpg">
<p>
Just before the city it descends sharply to the sea.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52036031257_4658e12c8d_o.jpg">
<p>
The city is very multi-level. I probably wouldn't want to live here permanently. First of all, it's a little expensive. Secondly, it’s far from the airport, making travel even around Turkey inconvenient. There are no big stores either, you will have to use delivery for everything. Thirdly, because of the terrain, you will be tortured by walking uphill (surely most people do not live right next to the port, but in residential areas on the hills).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52037120558_02062a8999_o.jpg">
<p>
But, of course, the city is simply wonderful for tourism, one of the most beautiful in Turkey.

<p>
Streets of the old city. Kaş resembles the towns on the islands of <a href="../thessaloniki">Greece</a>, and it is not surprising - before the First World War it mainly had Greek population.

Lycian tomb in the rock above Kaş. Lycia is the historical name of the area between modern Antalya and Fethiye. Once upon a time there was a state of the same name, where they spoke the Lycian language (now dead). The Lycians assimilated with the Greeks around the beginning of the Middle Ages. The most characteristic remains of Lycia are these rock tombs, they can be found in many cities on the coast.

In the distance to the right in the fog is the island of Kastellorizo ​​(Meis in Turkish), which belongs to Greece. You can go there by ferry if you have a Schengen visa, and even if not, it seems like you can get one upon arrival (but only valid for the island). I didn’t go this time, but I can try it sometime, buy some wine there, for example.

<h2>Kalkan</h2>
<p>
Kalkan is the last coastal town on the main road along the Lycian coast. Like in neighboring Kaş, there is a cozy atmosphere here, and there are even fewer people.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52037121353_6f5b6e2c16_o.jpg">

<h2>Kınık</h2>
<p>
The last city you can get to by local bus from Antalya is Kınık, located slightly inland, exactly on the border with Muğla province.
