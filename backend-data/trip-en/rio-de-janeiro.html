<h1>Brazil: Rio de Janeiro, Niteroi</h1>
<i>24-27 December 2012, 22-23 January 2013</i>
<h2>Rio de Janeiro</h2>
<p>
Rio de Janeiro, an idiot's dream. On the shore of a vast bay of the Atlantic Ocean. Good mulattoes live here, and the vast majority of people wear only white pants. The main streets of the city are not inferior to the best cities in the world in terms of the wealth of shops and splendor of buildings. Savvy Brazilian merchants are engaged in coffee dumping, and in salons they dance the Charleston “My girl has one little thing.” There are also many, many wild monkeys there. <i>These are quotations from the novel "The little golden calf" by Ilf and Petrov. The protagonist wanted to obtain a million roubles and escape from the USSR to Rio de Janeiro. In the end he got the million, but could not use it in the communist USSR, and finally was robbed at the border trying to leave.</i>

Monkeys here, instead of stray cats and rats, rummage through garbage cans in search of scraps.

The best view of the city center is from the mountain.

I had more than 4 hours waiting for the train to Corcovado, during which I managed to go to Copacabana, the most popular area in the city.
<p/>

<p>
It was enough for me to walk across the beach to the water and immediately move back because of the wild heat. I sat down under a palm tree near the road, following the example of a large number of shady types hanging out nearby.
<p/>

<p>
There's not much to do here, unless, of course, you're a pervert who likes to roll around in the scorching sun. The beach really attracts annoying people who want to earn extra money and don’t like to be photographed. You constantly feel like you are being watched.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256698636_4a37efdf85_o.jpg">
<p>
The only pro is that there are a lot of people in white pants.
<p/>

<p>
In general, the area does not have interesting architecture or beautiful views, but there are many overpriced shops and restaurants. Hotels in Copacabana start from 4,000 rubles, while in the city center you can rent a decent place for less than 1,000 ($30).
<p/>

<p>
The most luxurious and brilliant places are Ipanema, Leblon and the adjacent lagoon. It’s immediately obvious that serious people live here.

<p>
But we are not looking for easy ways. If you go a little further into the park, you can see a path leading up. Quite a lot of people climb it, mostly locals. The first 10 meters are very steep, you have to climb carefully.
<p/>

What follows is essentially a staircase.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257445339_a89d578970_o.jpg">
<p>
At the top there is a small booth where you can buy a ticket for the funicular to Sugarloaf, from here it costs half the price. It's definitely worth climbing to the top.

<p>
I specifically wanted to buy a plane ticket from Belo Horizonte to land at Santos Dumont Airport right on the bay. But in the end, I didn’t do this: there were no convenient flights, and the prices for planes in Brazil are quite high for foreigners, with the exception of some very popular destinations (to Iguazu or Manaus, for example), and you must buy plane tickets in advance, at least three weeks before, otherwise it will be much more expensive.
<p/>

Tourists are strongly advised not to go to the center of Rio de Janeiro on weekends. The streets are deserted and only homeless people can be seen lying right on the asphalt.
<p/>

For comparison, this is what the place looks like on a weekday.
<p/>

<p>
But I arrived exactly on Christmas Day, December 24, and I had no choice, so my first acquaintance with the city took place along the empty central streets.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257436149_e715cae138_o.jpg">
<p>
In reality, it's not that scary. Although I was not yet tanned and did not look like a Brazilian, no one even paid attention to me. Only one strange beggar woman asked me for money, to which I replied that Russia is a very poor country suffering from a bloody dictatorship, and moved on.
<p/>

This is the place where homeless people especially like to hang out on weekends, and on weekdays it’s quite lively.

In Rio de Janeiro, the problem of demolition of historical buildings is as acute as in Moscow. Many of the very beautiful colorful Portuguese style buildings are in disrepair and are being demolished and replaced by modern houses. Part of the center is already filled with new buildings.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256698491_739dbf991d_o.jpg">
<p>
Residents defend the old buildings to the best of their ability. On Carioca Street there are posters “Carioca Street - National Heritage”, “For the preservation of our shops and our traditions”.
<p/>

<p>
There is a lot of street trading in the center. Particularly popular are bookstores and shops selling old books. Brazil is clearly a much more reading country than Russia.

This place was two minutes from my hotel. There are many green places in Rio de Janeiro, even in the city center, people are not shy about lying on the grass.

The most beautiful place in Rio de Janeiro is definitely the Santa Teresa district. It is located at the top of a hill, where you have to climb the stairs. The top of the fence is protected by coils of barbed wire. This is how people protect themselves from crime, although now the crime rate is steadily declining and the relevance of such super-protection is falling.
<p/>

On the stairs, someone wrote a whole poem with tiles.

Santa Teresa is famous for its old trams, but they were discontinued several years ago after an accident on the line. Trams can be seen at the depot through the fence.
<p/>

Residents of Santa Teresa are fighting hard for the return of the tram. On the walls and under the windows of cars there is a symbol of struggle.

I arrive in Rio de Janeiro at five in the morning, at the station sleepy people are sitting on benches, there is a drinking fountain, but no wi-fi. I go into the newly opened station cafe, order a large glass of açaí and am surprised to read the text on the paper lying inside the tray:<br>
<i>
Living in Rio de Janeiro means being able to enjoy unique moments and places. Be sure that you live in the most beautiful city in the world, without having visited any other. Know that you can drive from the sea to the forest in 15 minutes. Enjoy Christ the Redeemer, Sugarloaf, the gentle contours of the mountains and Flamengo Park. Rio is pure inspiration. Welcome!

In Rio de Janeiro there is a bad tradition, also characteristic of Belgium: throwing garbage in large bags directly on the sidewalk.

There are trash cans everywhere, but there are few large bins, so there is often no time to actually throw out the bags.

The main transport in Rio is buses. There are simply an incredible number of them. Often there are even traffic jams from buses, one of which I was unlucky enough to stand in.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257436289_ec98797133_o.jpg">
<p>
You have to catch buses by waving your hands. In principle, if you know the area where you need to go, catching a bus is not difficult, since the names of the destination areas are written in large letters on the board. The only inconvenience occurs when your bus arrives, and at that time another or even a couple is already at the stop. Then there is a chance to miss your bus. Local residents have travel cards for the metro and buses; they can also pay the fare in cash to the conductor who operates the turnstile at the entrance. The turnstile is located slightly in the back of the cabin, so as not to repeat the Moscow mistake and not to delay the bus at stops with queues to enter. To get out, you need to pull the thread stretched under the ceiling before the desired stop.
<p/>

There is no bus map, although a list of routes indicating the areas at the stop sometimes helps. This is not a map, but a mockery.

In general, the level of domestic comfort and amenities in Brazil is not comparable to Russia, but is close to Western Europe. There is no parking on the sidewalks; cars go to underground parking lots. There are bike paths.

An interesting feature of local banks: doors with a metal detector. You need to put all the metal things from your pockets into a drawer from which you can’t get anything from the outside, then go through the revolving door and take your things. If the metal detector notices something, the door simply won’t open. Such protection from armed robbers hints that until recently not all was calm in the city. In criminal Russia, even in the dashing nineties, you could enter any bank through an ordinary door. In Brazil, despite all the apparent relaxation, people instinctively pay attention to the little things related to personal safety.

In the Soviet Union, both during the time of Stalin and after the war, there was rapid urbanization; there were few people willing to engage in agriculture; people left for cities whenever possible. The housing problem was acute, there was not enough housing, and people settled in communal apartments. Today this may seem wild, but once upon a time my grandparents lived in Moscow in conditions in which only migrant workers now live, and they were happy about it. There was no communism in Brazil, and pieces of rooms were not given away for free, but the weather in Brazil is always warm, so people who came to large cities to earn money built huts from whatever they could get their hands on. I imagined favelas as something like Khitrovka, described in the book “Moscow and Muscovites” by Gilyarovsky, but there is a significant difference. On Khitrovka there were mainly visiting bandits and outcasts from society, while in the favelas the majority of the population are ordinary people who have lived there for generations. They don’t have money for a mortgage, but they have some kind of work, so they are not angry at the world around them. "The rich want peace so they can stay rich, and we want peace so we can stay alive."

Until recently, the favelas of Rio were also inhabited by bandits and drug lords who were hiding from justice, and the local population was actually held hostage by them, unable to resist anything. Then (in 2010) the government cleared out most of the favelas, staging a show with tank rides and mass executions of anyone who resisted. There are still bad favelas, but they are on the far outskirts of the city. In the photo there is a medium-sized favela called Pedra Lisa. It seems to have been pacified, but there is an increased concentration of shady types around it due to its proximity to the station.
<p/>

The largest favela in Rio and in all of Brazil is called Rocinha, but it’s a bit of a drive to get to it, so I decided to go to a place called Pavão Pavãozinho, between Copacabana and Ipanema. Several years ago this place was among the relatively dangerous ones.

I bought a can of beer and walked around the streets. Life was in full swing everywhere, on the main street there were eateries and shops at every turn. Some kids were dancing on the stairs leading to the top of the favela. There were also a large number of men in construction uniforms walking around. This favela is gradually being demolished, replacing multi-colored cubes with apartment buildings. There are no more slums at the bottom of the hill.

The most popular favela for tourists is Santa Marta, next to the Botafogo district. One of Michael Jackson's videos was filmed here (and also in the center of Salvador de Bahia). There is a tourist information office downstairs, but I arrived late in the afternoon and it was not open.

A makeshift map of the area hangs nearby.

Santa Marta is quite a beautiful place. Somewhere in Europe they would call it “the narrow cobbled streets of the old town rising to the top of the hill,” but here it is an area where the poor live.

<p>
The big problem in favelas is garbage. Here in the panorama of the entrance to Santa Marta there are huge containers. You can’t take the garbage out from the top of the favela by car; the residents are self-sufficient.
<p/>

<p>
Water supply and sewerage in favelas is often homemade, although now the benefits of civilization are gradually being delivered here. If you look under the stairs, you can see the drain.

<p>
There is no particular danger here, but it is still better to walk here with a guide. Not because of the bandits, but simply because it is difficult to find the road alone. The "streets" in the favelas look like this.
<p/>

<p>
Walking along such stairs, you constantly bump into the entrances to someone’s house, so walking is a little uncomfortable. This is a pretty decent-looking courtyard, and you can’t say it’s a slum.

<p>
Here's a more authentic look. Over several generations, most of the houses in the favelas were rebuilt from more or less stable building materials such as bricks; there are relatively few dilapidated wooden houses.

The next time I'm in Rio, I'll definitely go to these places again.

<h2>Niteroi</h2>
<p>
For some reason, many people travel from Russia to Rio de Janeiro to lie on the beach. In my opinion, there are suitable places for this that are much faster and cheaper to get to, but if you really want to be on the beach, I would stay in Niteroi. Niteroi is located directly opposite Rio, so going on an excursion to Corcovado is not difficult, but there are very few favelas there, a low crime rate, a high standard of living, prices are much lower than in Copacabana, and there is a very beautiful and relatively deserted beach with paradise views.

Then the private villas begin. On the walls are the already familiar barbed wire and broken glass.

Not very long ago, Niemeyer Street opened near the shore with buildings in the same cosmic style. Many more of Niemeyer's signature works are located in the capital and in Belo Horizonte, but less iconic houses can be seen in many other cities.

In honor of Christmas, ribbons were hung, and they spread out from one pillar in all directions in rays, which creates an interesting visual effect.

You can still see the tram tracks, although trams were canceled here about 50 years ago.

The house is in the German style, apparently built by emigrants. In the south of Brazil there are entire small towns built up with houses of this type.
