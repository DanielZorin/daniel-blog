<h1>New Zealand: Christchurch, Mount Cook, Queenstown, Milford Sound, Dunedin, Oamaru</h1>
<i>24-31 March 2019</i>
<h2>Christchurch</h2>
<p>
New Zealand is the last major piece of land to be inhabited by people just 700 years ago. Unlike Australia, where prisoners were exiled, New Zealand was colonized in the 19th century by free people, and this was accompanied by a fierce struggle with the indigenous Maori inhabitants for territory. Colonization began from the South Island, since it was not as crowded as the North Island, so the oldest cities are in the south. Christchurch is currently the largest city in the South Island. In recent years, this city has been in the news twice due to sad events: first it was destroyed by an earthquake in 2011, and in 2019 there was a terrorist attack on the mosque, exactly a week before my arrival. On one of the streets in the center there were flowers.

<p>
Despite the damage from the earthquake, Christchurch has a lot of typically English Gothic architecture. The main cathedral is in ruins and surrounded by a fence.

The central square near the cathedral now looks something like this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255295287_3c1ac46891_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Only one new building stands out.

The forests in New Zealand look unusual due to the large number of huge ferns.
<p/>

The residential area where I lived. This is what most of Christchurch looks like.
<p/>

<p>
The main street of the residential area. There are restaurants, fast foods, and supermarkets here. In most cities in New Zealand, I lived in such residential areas, but nevertheless, shops there were practically within walking distance (no more than 10-15 minutes).

In supermarkets they don’t give bags anywhere.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255296072_8e0366f664_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Due to extreme weather, I was forced to stay in Christchurch one day longer. There was nothing special to do, I walked around the surrounding residential areas.

All over the city there are these massive structures indicating the position of electrical cables.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256025626_cd5b7fae8a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I wandered into a small park near the river, it’s about 20 meters wide at most, but it looks very dense.
<p/>

<p>
New Zealand is a country where things last a long time and it is customary to repair them, rather than buy new ones, as in America. Equipment and cars are usually more expensive here due to the remote location. In many houses I have seen such unusual electric stoves with spiral burners.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257069245_4696c1ea6b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And in New Zealand, like in England, sinks have two taps - with hot and cold water.
<p/>

<h2>Mount Cook</h2>
<p>
My original plan was to travel from Christchurch to Queenstown via the west coast. However, the weather ruined this plan, as both the railway across the island and the route along the west coast were closed due to the storm. I had to urgently change plans to get to Queenstown by a shorter route through Mount Cook. The journey took the whole day, but along the way I still saw a lot of characteristic New Zealand landscapes.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257552400_c562e44d00_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A chain of mountains (the Southern Alps) stretches along the western coast, at the tops of them there are numerous glaciers, which, when melting, create rivers that cross the island from west to east. In autumn they are widest and fullest.
<p/>

<p>
But some have already dried out for the winter.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255781277_1972f1c887_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The first stop is in the town of Geraldine on the Timaru - Queenstown - Christchurch fork.

New Zealand is famous for its sheep and cows (pictured on butter packaging). Indeed, sheep graze everywhere along the roads.

<p>
There are many lakes in the mountains on the site of melted glaciers; they have a characteristic elongated shape. One of the largest is Lake Tekapo.

<p>
Properly, you need to stay in the national park for at least one night; there are many hotels and hostels in the village of Aoraki. The surrounding area can basically be explored on foot; the main tracks there are about 5 kilometers long.

I bought them to try, they turned out to look and taste more like peaches, but the texture was dense, like nectarines.

<h2>Queenstown</h2>
<p>
Queenstown is the most touristic city in New Zealand. There are only 15 thousand people here, but almost 3 million tourists a year. If we take into account that the majority come in the summer, and not for 1 day, we can estimate that at any given time in the summer there are several times more tourists than local residents. Therefore, in fact, airbnb does not work well here, and hotels are more expensive than in other cities.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257423454_ff6c23ece4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The city mainly consists of hotels, cafes and souvenir shops.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255948547_eda4c2050b_h.jpg"/>

<p>
What to do in Queenstown? Well, firstly, from there you can go to the fjords, which will be discussed separately. Secondly, there are many options for practicing all kinds of extreme sports. Interestingly, bungee jumping was invented in Queenstown, the first bungee was on a river 20 kilometers from the city. The prices seem inhumane, although I don't know how much it costs in other countries, perhaps just as expensive. This kind of entertainment is not for me.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257719395_aeda978a92_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Those who hate rides and jumping as much as I do can take a relaxing hike around the area. There are a lot of places around here, there are even shuttles to neighboring towns at reasonable prices (a little more expensive than buses). I chose the easiest option and walked through the immediate surroundings of Queenstown. There are two mountains near the city, a cable car leads to one of them, and I went to the second (Queenstown hill).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256877843_cb3f88b427_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Even the streets higher up the hill have good views.

The Maps.me map showed a path to the top from the east, but it seems I got off it somewhere.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255948762_8b1ab4bd83_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I found myself in a dark forest, where there were many barely noticeable paths, so I had to walk almost at random, just in the uphill direction.

It seems that the heroes of “The Hobbit” and “The Lord of the Rings” often walked through such forests.

<p/>

<p>
And I reached the top of the hill.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256878093_646fd2962d_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256878143_aef6d4e3a7_h.jpg"/>

It's still a bit of a climb to get there.
<p/>

Interestingly, alpine fir trees are considered weeds here, crowding out the local flora. They are being cut down mercilessly: it is clear that all of them on the left have already been cut down, but not yet on the right.
<p/>

I went back down along the eastern path, it is much easier than the dark forest where I climbed. It's pretty light everywhere. There are houses for gnomes along the road.

<h2>Milford Sound</h2>
<p>
In the south of New Zealand there is Fiordland National Park - the largest piece of untouched nature on the islands and one of the most picturesque places on Earth, in some places similar to the scenery from films about dinosaurs.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257484305_2791acb78d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The road to Fiordland begins in the town of Te Anau. The essence of this town is easy to understand by looking at the main street.

The downside of Fiordland is that there is only one road for cars, so all the tourists are on it. At the observation decks the crowd looks something like this:

To avoid this, you need to walk there, but you need way more than one day for this.

It's funny that the first time I saw the fjord was in New Zealand, and not in nearby Norway. There are also similar fjords in southern Chile and Alaska, but New Zealand and Norway are the most accessible and closest to civilization. Judging by the map, besides Milford Sound, there are many other fjords in the same region, but no one goes there, and there are no roads there, at most there are walking paths, and even that not everywhere. I wonder why this happened?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256442226_28e4ea142b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A cruise along the fjord costs 45-50 New Zealand dollars (~35 US dollars) and lasts an hour and a half.
<p/>

The scale of this place is easy to appreciate by comparing the size of the rocks with the size of the ship.

<h2>Dunedin</h2>
<p>
Dunedin is New Zealand's oldest colonial city, and one of its most beautiful. It was founded by settlers from Scotland and named after Edinburgh (in Scottish it is called Dunedin). Who would have thought that the stress falls on the second syllable, it was very difficult to get used to it, especially since stressed E is rarely pronounced as [i]. For a long time Dunedin was the largest city in the country, now it is in sixth place, but is in the top four in terms of importance due to its large university and cultural heritage.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255347102_80d380c26e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The symbol of the city is the railway station building, the appearance of which is a reference to Flemish and Dutch architecture.

Surprisingly, there are also a lot of old buildings there. It is not customary here to demolish houses after paying off the mortgage.

Sea shore. Dunedin is the southernmost city I've been to. To be completely pedantic, the southernmost point where I stood was Dunedin Airport, a bit further south than the city itself.

It’s not so easy to get further south; there is also the city of Invercargill, and even further south is only Argentina's Tierra del Fuego, and Antarctica.

<h2>Oamaru</h2>
<p>
The small town of Oamaru, an hour and a half north of Dunedin, is famous for its well-preserved Victorian architecture and steampunk festivals. Probably, it was precisely such a festival that Artemy Lebedev accidentally came to when he was <a href="https://www.tema.ru/travel/new-zealand-3/#oamaru">in New Zealand in 2009</a> .
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256578751_dc22abac33_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I didn't notice anyone wearing 19th century costumes, although you can actually buy them in souvenir shops. But it is a fact that the city looks amazing in retro style.
<p/>

<p>
Oamaru is a small city, essentially it has one big main street, which is also the main highway of the South Island. There is no bypass road, which turned out to be very useful when I had to hitchhike out of the city - you can stop right in the center.

There is a canopy over the sidewalk when you stand below, and you can’t see that the houses have unusual facades.

<p>
On the other side of the hill, yellow-eyed penguins live on the beach. Penguins wake up early in the morning and swim out to sea to hunt; in the evening they return to the shore to rest and sleep. In the evening you can notice them. Penguins are very shy, so access to the beach is closed several hours before sunset, and you can only watch from an observation deck high on the rocks.
<p/>

<p>
Unfortunately, I couldn’t wait for the penguins - I had to catch the return bus. As it turned out, I left in vain, because the bus was three hours late, I didn’t wait for it and hitchhiked back to Dunedin. I only looked at the seals.

<h2>Flights</h2>
<p>
Let's look at New Zealand from above! I had two flights over the South Island, the first time I crossed it from west to east, the second time from south to north. This is approaching the west coast, the city of Hokitika.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257068620_7aa2486106_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The mountains begin almost immediately off the west coast. The highest part is covered with clouds, but the peak of Mount Cook can be seen in the distance.

New Zealand is located at the junction of lithospheric plates, the eastern plate seems to cover the western one, forming mountains that slowly, slowly grow upward.
