<h1>Turkey: Alanya, Manavgat, Side</h1>
<i>5-7 February 2023</i>
<h2>Alanya</h2>
<p>
Alanya remained essentially the last significant tourist city in Turkey where I had not been. Alanya is located about two hours east of Antalya, in its vicinity there are also a lot of beaches and resort hotels, and it is also perhaps the most “Russian” city in Turkey, if you evaluate the share of foreigners in the total population of the city (after all, Antalya has a million people, and in Alanya only 300k).

<p>
The hotel turned out to be very unusual - teddy bears hung all over the facades. Inside, the corridors were illuminated with red light, as if it were a Korean love hotel.

I woke up the next day at 4 am with the bed shaking. These were echoes of the disastrous earthquake in <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/734358.html">Gaziantep</a> on February 6, 2023. I immediately understood what was happening, because before that I had already been caught in an earthquake in <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/667086.html">Japan in 2020</a>.

Historically, Alanya was located on top of a steep cliff near the seashore. Now the city has grown in both directions along the coast: to the east is Mahmutlar beach, to the west is Cleopatra beach, which had my hotel.
<p/>

<p>
The beach was deserted and there were waves.

At the very end of the beach there is the Damlatas cave, very convenient. As soon as I walked in, everything immediately fogged up.

Alanya is growing inland, developing the slopes of the surrounding hills. There are at least two observation decks - the inscription "I love Alanya", which can be seen in panoramic photos from the fortress, and the mosque in the Tepe area, slightly higher.

<h2>Manavgat</h2>
<p>
The city of Manavgat is located approximately halfway between Alanya and Antalya. The city itself is a few kilometers from the sea, but in the surrounding area there are many resort villages with large hotels.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52688506066_3189c4b094_o.jpg">

<p>
The main attraction of Manavgat is the waterfall of the same name, which at one time was even depicted on Turkish banknotes. People are taken here on sightseeing tours, even I was there once in 2008.

<h2>Side</h2>
<p>
A few kilometers from Manavgat on the seashore is the tourist town of Side, famous for its ancient ruins, perhaps the largest in the province of Antalya after <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/725221.html">Xanthos</a>. Interestingly, the city was uninhabited for almost a thousand years until almost the end of the 19th century, despite its convenient location on a peninsula by the sea.
<p/>

<p>
When you arrive by minibus from Manavgat, you find yourself at the northern edge of the archaeological zone. You have to go through it to get to the modern part of the city on the peninsula.
