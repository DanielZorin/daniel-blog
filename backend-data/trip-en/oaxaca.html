<h1>Mexico: Puebla, Oaxaca, Acapulco</h1>
<i>12-16 November 2014</i>
<h2>Puebla</h2>
<p>
By this point, I was already accustomed to what Mexico looks like, and besides, after Guanajuato, it was no longer easy for this or that city to surprise me. Puebla is similar to other Mexican UNESCO heritage cities - a colonial center with cathedrals, built on a smooth grid.
<p/>

<p>
As always, colorful houses.

Cathedrals on a grand scale.

Antique.

Drawings even on the ground.

<p>
When I arrived in the evening, I took the wrong bus and ended up in the wrong place instead of the center. I didn’t find any buses in the right direction from there and decided to walk, since it’s very easy to navigate the city: the streets are numbered from the central square, to the south and west - even, to the north and east - odd. I was at the intersection of 34 and 29 streets, and should have been at the intersection of 14 and 3, only 10 blocks to the east and 13 to the south.
There were very few people on the streets, although many food stalls were open. In general, the districts are not very different in atmosphere from the outskirts of medium-sized Russian cities, only there are no private plots near the houses. So walking at night in Latin America is not as suicidal as it might seem at first glance.
<p/>

<p>
By the way, the signs in Puebla are in Braille.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256667351_196cfbd738_o.jpg">
<p>
After exploring the center of Puebla, I went for entertainment to the neighboring town of Cholula. They promised the largest pyramid in Mexico. In reality, the pyramid looks more like a hill with grass.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256667481_a835d85a77_o.jpg">
<p>
Stone structures are only at the bottom.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255939412_59a0112945_o.jpg">
<p>
But this is the only pyramid where you can and should go inside through a narrow tunnel, for this reason alone it deserves a visit.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257414359_858ea24b53_o.jpg">
<p>
From here you can clearly see the center of Puebla, in which several free-standing skyscrapers are chaotically built.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257710020_28f17d94cb_o.jpg">
<p>
Puebla and Cholula are connected by a bridge, like in <a href="../vladivostok">Vladivostok</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255939457_e417b071c0_o.jpg">
<p>
In fact, these two cities flow into one another smoothly.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255939467_a8cd0207ae_o.jpg">
<p>
The monastery in the center of Cholula looks impressive from above. When you get close to it, it's harder to grasp its scale because only a small part is visible.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256667536_f2b8524626_o.jpg">
<p>
There are many volcanoes around Puebla, which Mexico is very rich in. If I'm not mistaken, on the left is Popocatepetl.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256868438_a2174dedd6_o.jpg">
<p>
“I should try it too,” I thought and decided to climb the volcano too. This one.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255939582_1c4994d0a9_o.jpg">
<p>
This is the world's smallest volcano, Cuescomate, located in a residential area of Puebla. You can go down into the crater.
<p/>

There is only water dripping below.

<p>
By the way, the entrance fee is 10 pesos! This vividly reminded me of the episode from “The Twelve Chairs,” when Ostap sold tickets to enter <a href="../pyatigorsk">Proval in Pyatigorsk</a>.
<p/>

<h2>Oaxaca</h2>
<p>
The city of Oaxaca itself is not particularly interesting, so I absolutely did the right thing by waking up early in the morning and going to explore its fantastic surroundings.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257622025_b934fdf07a_o.jpg">
<p>
The first transfer stop is at a village called Tlacolula de Matamoros.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256780613_eee9b06bc0_o.jpg">
<p>
There is no urban gloss here, but everything is about the same.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256780678_76d1aa3f12_o.jpg">
<p>
There are basically no first class buses here, which is great! Second class is the same, but cheaper.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257327104_9579be3649_o.jpg">
<p>
An incredible fact: in Tlacolula and other villages there are the same three-wheeled Bajaj jalopies as in <a href="../indonesia-1">Jakarta</a>, the capital of Indonesia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255851642_0c933441a2_o.jpg">
<p>
Then, with a transfer in the town of Mitla, I got to Hierve el Agua. It's funny that on the road tourists are charged a fee of 10 pesos "for the construction of a normal road."
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255851952_a32dca0c37_o.jpg">
<p>
There really is almost no infrastructure, except for a few cafes, and there are few tourists (there are many more in Oaxaca itself).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257327284_7a20beff9f_o.jpg">
<p>
So hurry up to enjoy the miracle of nature, while there is not even a fence over the cliff!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257622060_de7f6523a4_o.jpg">
<p>
If my impression from the photographs is correct, Pamukkale in Turkey is similar to Hierve el Agua.

The rocks look like they are a waterfall.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257622000_357b002f73_o.jpg">
<p>
It’s interesting that almost no one goes to this rock, even though it’s a ten-minute walk. Although from there you can see the first rock.

There are ruins here that are included in the UNESCO list, but I was not particularly impressed by them. Ruins are like ruins.

I was amused with the price tag at the box office, where it was calculated how much any number of tickets from 1 to 103 would cost.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256781003_15bd5da62e_o.jpg">
<p>
The ruins behind the fence are a small part of the real Zapotec city, it’s just that the palaces are better preserved than the houses of ordinary people. But in the city, sometimes you can find antiquities in someone's backyard.

The last stop on the program was the Tule tree, also known as Ahuehuete.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255852392_18925c3118_o.jpg">

This is the thickest tree in the world, its thickness is 14 meters.

I traveled this entire route without any particular difficulty in these collective taxis that carry people between all these villages.

Traveling around Mexico, I did not try to visit all possible archaeological zones, of which there are a huge number, but limited myself to the most significant ones. In my amateurish opinion, the most impressive ruins are Monte Alban. The Zapotecs did a good job of building their city on top of a hill, so you can literally feel like you’re under the clouds.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257328219_d1ccab09e7_o.jpg">
<p>
Well, for those who don’t like crowds, this place is also suitable, because there are much fewer people than in Teotihuacan and Chichen Itza.
<p/>

You can get to Monte Alban by tourist minibus, but I was not too lazy to take the city bus, from the final stop of which it’s another 40 minutes walk. Was rewarded with good views of Oaxaca.

Oaxaca is home to the birthplace of President Juarez, which is why the city's full name is Oaxaca de Juarez.

<p>
Near the bus station for second-class buses, from where I left for Mexico City, there is a regular bazaar going on. During the day everything looks calm, but in the evening it looks a bit murky, with incredibly ugly prostitutes lining the streets. In this mess, I snacked on the cheapest tacos I've seen in Mexico - 2 pesos each.
<p/>

<h2>Acapulco</h2>
<p>
“Acapulco ay-ay-ay-ay” - that’s what I remembered from childhood about this city (a song by Latvian singer Laima Vaikule). I recently saw Acapulco in some ranking among the top three most criminal cities in the world. This, of course, is an exaggeration, but in general in the Guerrero region there is now a relative rampant banditry, in particular, the sensational brutal murder of 40 students took place there. This concerns Acapulco itself to a lesser extent, although tension is felt here, in particular, in the central square under the windows of my hotel there was complete silence already at about 9 pm.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255062857_a2a78f1145_o.jpg">
<p>
Acapulco is most similar to <a href="../rio-de-janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>. Crime, and beaches, and views of the bay and hills.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255994483_6ed5850e6f_o.jpg">

American tourists used to flock to Acapulco in droves. Now they have all moved to Cancun, where there is a fenced-off safe zone for them. But Acapulco as a resort is not in danger of extinction, because it is the closest resort to Mexico City with a population of 20 million.
<p/>

In terms of historical attractions, Acapulco cannot compete with the top cities of Mexico. There is only a small fort here.

The buses are interesting; apparently, they belong to the drivers themselves, and everyone decorates it the way they like.

There are beetle cars like these driving around in large numbers all over Mexico. They are produced here, which is why they are popular.
