<h1>Russia: Krapivna, Shchyokino, Tula</h1>
<i>29 August 2020</i>
<h2>Krapivna</h2>
<p>
Continuing to explore the historical cities of Russia, I went to the Tula region to Krapivna. Of the entire list, only two cities now have the status of rural settlements: Krapivna and <a href="../rostov-on-don">stanitsa Starocherkasskaya</a>. However, getting to Krapivna is not particularly difficult: there are direct buses from Tula (to the large village of Arsenyevo) 6-7 times a day, and also, as I found out on the spot, from the nearest town of Shchyokino (25 km) at least once a day. Minibuses and buses run through Krapivna every hour to two neighboring villages.

<p>
The road is of excellent quality.

<p>
A pavilion has already been built on the square, probably for a store with a tourist center.

<p>
Near the highway at the exit from Krapivna there is a cemetery and an abandoned Church of All Saints.

<p>
Now let's go to the center. Since this is a village, everything is very close, there are no kilometers of Soviet panel or private buildings that appeared with the growth of the city's population. Everything here is like in the 19th century, when the population of any city was measured in thousands, not hundreds of thousands.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256294826_fb97afbb77_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On the central square stands the main temple of Krapivna. It was closed for restoration, so I couldn't get inside. Judging by old photographs, 10 years ago this temple was operational and was in more or less normal condition (well, certainly not in the same condition as the church above).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256493233_562d9b899e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Krapivna is being improved at a rapid pace right now. Paths are being laid. The building with the columns on the right was abandoned 5 years ago.
<p/>

<p>
The road with the old pavement seems to be preserved, very cool.
<p/>

<p>
The central square is partially ready.

<p>
And this house will be restored, it seems. The fence is cool, made of uneven boards.

<p>
Merchant's mansion (Prianchikov's house). Judging by old photographs, 5 years ago it was so bad that the wall was propped up at one end with a large log. The reconstruction, in my amateurish opinion, is quite decent, the only thing is that the walls were painted blue instead of yellow.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257336435_de30bbce08_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The second merchant mansion is currently being restored. There doesn't seem to be much to restore inside, so everything is being redone.

The characteristic gate on the right indicates that there used to be a fire station here. The entrance group is also an extension.
<p/>

It looks like the fire department has been overtaken by what it was fighting - a fire.

<h2>Shchyokino</h2>
<p>
Shchyokino is an industrial city 25 kilometers south of Tula. There are two chemical plants here. I got here on the road from Krapivna, and decided to explore the city center, since going to Tula is not a problem at all - minibuses run along the main road every 15 minutes.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256245774_91066f621a_h.jpg"/>

<p>
The southern front line passed through the Shchyokino area during the Battle of Moscow at the end of 1941.

<p>
The main street leading to Tula is lined with four-story buildings like this.

Square in honor of the city's anniversary. Shchyokino received city status in 1938, it means it was created in 1978.

<p>
Monument to Igor Talkov, who was born in a village near Shchyokino and studied at a local school. If you didn’t catch Perestroika, then you’re unlikely to remember who it is - Talkov became popular in the late 1980s thanks to songs against communism, and was killed under mysterious circumstances at the end of 1991, a couple of months before the collapse of the USSR. Unlike Viktor Tsoi, Talkov is now practically forgotten.

<h2>Tula</h2>
<p>
There was not much time left for Tula after Krapivna, but I still saw more than on <a href="../tula">last trip</a>. On the way from Shchyokino, I left on the southern outskirts of Tula - the former village of Kosaya Gora, located among picturesque forests.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256408019_aa76aed8bc_h.jpg"/>

<p>
The chimneys of a metallurgical plant rise above the forests, it looks very colorful.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256704295_7384df3dd3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A little later I learned that the best panoramic view of the plant will be from the route along which minibuses travel to the center of Tula, however, there are no buildings or stops along the road, so you will have to walk along the edge of the route.

Now Tula itself. From the last time I remembered the city very poorly, except for the Kremlin and the square with Lenin in the center, and a lot of crumbling houses. The city has changed a lot in 7 years.

A street near the Kremlin is being reconstructed to make it pedestrian. In general, this part of the city (east of the Kremlin) is the oldest, while the current busiest streets like Lenin Avenue are mostly more recent.

The dogs are sleeping at the bus stop. In 2013, from a trip to Tula, I really remember how I literally barely squeezed into a minibus on the way back to the station. At that time, there were still minibuses in Moscow (they were canceled in 2016), but people no longer rode them standing. In 2020, in Tula they still ride minibuses standing, although here I didn’t get into rush hour.
