<h1>Lithuania: Vilnius</h1>

<h2>Vilnius</h2>
<p>
A big trip to North America began from Lithuania, where I arrived by train, buying a ticket to Kaliningrad because it's cheaper. I had one day on the way there and one on the way back, but on the way back I barely had enough energy to walk to the nearest supermarket and buy cheese. But on the way there I was still fresh, and finally reached the top of the mountain of three crosses.

<p>
The path there goes from Užupis along the river, the climb is not particularly difficult.

Near the standing crosses lie the remains of old ones.

The rest of the places were basically familiar.

An important task in Vilnius was to buy food for three days in Iceland.

I found some interesting drawings near the station.

This is Putin and Trump, right?

For the first time I found myself at Vilnius airport; before, I always came here by train or bus. When I approached the airport, I was greatly surprised - the air terminal here is in the Stalinist Empire style, straight from the 1950s, with statues of workers and farmers on the pediment.

<p>
Inside, when you walk in, it looks like an old small town train station rather than a major airport.

<p>
Then you take the elevator to the second floor...

<p>
You seem to go into the next room, and there is a road.
<p/>

<p>
And beyond the road is the airport itself. The new modern terminal fits in smartly.

<h2>Полет</h2>
<p>
I specifically chose a seat by the window in the hope of seeing Iceland through the porthole, but instead I saw only fog. But on the way we flew over Norway, and the visibility there was excellent.

We take off over Lithuania.

The plane flew exactly over the city of Bergen, but the city itself was not visible.
