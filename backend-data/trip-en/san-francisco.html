<h1>USA: Las Vegas, San Francisco</h1>
<i>27-30 November 2014</i>
<h2>Las Vegas</h2>
<p>
The route of the Dallas - Las Vegas plane passes just over the states of New Mexico and Arizona. I was again incredibly lucky: I was able to get a window seat on the starboard side through online check-in, and there were no clouds just like when I flew over <a href="../los-angeles">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="../guadalajara">Baja California</a>. As you might guess, this is the Grand Canyon. Great view for almost free!

Before this there were several more gorgeous views of the desert.

This lake is called Lake Las Vegas.

And here is the city itself. Even compared to the backdrop of Los Angeles, the cloning of the development is striking.
<p/>

All the same!

In Las Vegas, I had a layover of only two hours; there was no way to make it longer without increasing the ticket price several times. Usually I don’t go to the city on such a short transfer, but this time I had to try my luck, especially since the place was just right for this. Already in the arrival hall you are greeted by slot machines.
<p/>

<p>
There was very little time, so the plan was simple: get to the main street (the Strip) and back. The airport is located almost in the city center, it takes 10-15 minutes by car, but by bus you need to change. From the transfer point you can clearly see that Las Vegas is literally one (1) street.
<p/>

There is literally nothing behind this facade, the wind is blowing.

There is no such amount of kitsch per square meter anywhere in the world.

<p>
Of course, I would love to hang out here for a day or two and look at all this madness. Coming here for a longer period of “relaxation” in the middle of the desert - sorry. By and large, Americans come here for three things: prostitutes, drugs, gambling (all of this is usually prohibited in other states). Well, if you don’t live in the USA, then all this can be found much closer and much more accessible.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255613937_3bc61d8715_o.jpg">
<p>
But it sure is beautiful here in the evening.
<p/>

<p>
Living here must be very strange. All work is for the entertainment industry, there are high chances of not fitting into the market.
<p/>

<p>
On the way back, I finally found the famous Las Vegas newspaper boxes. Usually in America there are local newspapers, and here there are catalogs of escort services.
<p/>

I collected a whole pack of cards for my collection, like here under glass, the day was not in vain.

Never before have I been so close to missing a plane, but I still made it.

<h2>San Francisco</h2>
<p>
San Francisco is shocking. Ilf and Petrov wrote that this is the most beautiful city in America, but what did I see immediately after my arrival? A grey, dirty and ugly city. I thought the comparison with <a href="../vladivostok">Vladivostok</a> was a joke, but in a way it's even a compliment for San Francisco.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254720912_e3255ef6b3_o.jpg">
<p>
In Russia, people don’t give a damn about everything that’s outside the door of their apartment. They can live in a luxurious apartment with European-quality renovation, located in a dirty entrance to a commieblock with a littered yard. In America, people have a wider comfort zone, but the entire city is not included in it either. In one block everything can be good, but across the street everything can be bad, and nothing can be done: “Ghetto, sir!” This is especially noticeable in San Francisco, where bad neighborhoods are also located in the very center. Sometimes it seems that you are in Moscow in 1992.
<p/>

<p>
On the square opposite the city hall, a black man came up to me, said, “Why the fuck could I not shoot you in the mouth,” and laughed hysterically. Probably stoned.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254720742_be012f2dd4_o.jpg">
<p>
On the main street, and already in a good area, I saw a man right in the middle of the road take out his personal belongings and piss on the tram tracks.

Panhandlers in San Francisco are mostly young people. They don’t want to work, they want to sit on the street and do nothing.

There are no fewer homeless people in San Francisco than in <a href="../paris">Paris</a>, but there are much more stoned homeless people.

The panorama of San Francisco is much more similar to the panorama of Vladivostok than I thought.

San Francisco is the birthplace of the hippies. There is an area here where you are most likely to meet people with long, dirty hair.

San Francisco is a city of absolute freedom, where there are not even the services of absolute freedom limiters. Here you can even walk down the street naked! Passers-by didn’t react much, didn’t turn around, as if this was in the order of things here.

To overcome the two hills on the way from the main street to the embankment, those antique cable trams are very useful.
<p/>

<p>
They have two drawbacks: there is always a crowd of tourists, and the fare is monstrously expensive - $6. Luckily, the pass works (I bought a three-day pass for $23, the smartest decision). I was very surprised that many people pay cash for travel. For Americans, 6 dollars is not money at all.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255658263_79e58260e8_o.jpg">
<p>
An alternative is to take a regular tram around the hill.

In San Francisco there are several tram lines that go underground in the city center and are similar to the subway (as in <a href="../volgograd">Volgograd</a>)
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256201584_a8d935b1e6_o.jpg">

There are also high-speed trains connecting different cities in Silicon Valley. This line has a small branch to Oakland Airport, which can be used as an alternative to the main San Francisco airport.

In general, there is a lot of electric transport in San Francisco; at some intersections there is a real web of wires.

The best observation deck is Twin Peaks. I heard that there is a movie with this name, but it turns out it has nothing to do with San Francisco.

From here you can see that this city also has skyscrapers in the center and one-story houses in all other places.

In San Francisco, like in Vladivostok, there are two bridges, one from the city center to the area opposite the center, the second - from the outskirts to somewhere far away.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255452431_9dc9509686_o.jpg">

The second bridge only leads to the island, but shortens the path to the north.

You won't be able to run across the bridge like in the James Bond movie; the defenses are strong. Looks like you can try to climb up in the middle of the bridge, there is no such barbed wire there.

Like any self-respecting city, SF has a Chinatown. Here you can buy instant noodles for 40 cents and souvenirs for a dollar. Unfortunately, there was no dollar chicken and rice like in New York.

In summary, San Francisco is a city of contrasts. Here dirt and degradation coexist with wealth and prosperity. It’s definitely worth coming here to see if you’re in America.
