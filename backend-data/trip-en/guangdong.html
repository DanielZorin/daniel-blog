<h1>China: Zhuhai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Foshan, Huizhou</h1>
<i>19-27 October 2013</i>
<h2>Zhuhai</h2>
<p>
You leave the border terminal and find yourself in a completely different country, huge and unique. The first thing that catches your eye is how quickly the inscriptions in English disappear, which in Hong Kong and Macau always duplicate the inscriptions in Chinese. There are almost 30 times more foreign tourists in China than in Russia (China is in third place in the world after France and the USA), but still this is a drop in the bucket compared to the Chinese, who themselves have a hard time getting to know their entire country (because it is so big).

Everything is written in only hieroglyphs, is this conceivable in Hong Kong, with the best navigation system for tourists in the world?

I didn’t plan to stay too long in Zhuhai; I had to go to Shenzhen, on the other side of the Pearl River Delta, by ferry. Zhuhai is not a particularly interesting city. This is a free economic zone, but much smaller in size than Shenzhen. The city is built up with all sorts of fresh skyscrapers with offices.

On every escalator in China there are rules of conduct with text explanations. Stand carefully, hold on to the handrails, don’t walk around in Crocs!

<h2>Shenzhen</h2>
<p>
The city of Shenzhen began to be built only about 40 years ago, and now more than 10 million people live in it. Therefore, it is very convenient to witness a typical modern Chinese city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255704828_863e19b8cf_o.jpg">
<p>
I can say that Shenzhen is several cities adjacent to each other. There is no such thing that here is the center, and the rest are different outskirts. Each district has its own center and its outskirts. I lived in the Bao'an district, practically in its central square. The distances in the city are enormous, once I was forced to take a taxi through the entire city, it took almost an hour (and cost 500 rubles / $15), despite the fact that most of the route ran along a high-speed overpass without traffic lights.
<p/>

<p>
The tracks look something like this, nothing is visible on the horizon.
<p/>

<p>
Traffic jams in Shenzhen (and other cities in China) are non-existent. On the contrary, you can stand in the middle of the road, calmly take a photo of the view into the distance and move on without fear of being hit.

<p>
Walking around the business center of Shenzhen is about as “exciting” as walking around <a href="../dubai">Dubai</a>. Guangdong province is very hot, and the entire city center is a mixture of construction, offices and shopping centers. If tourists come here, it is mainly for the sake of amusement parks, for example, there is the “Window to the World” park, where mini-copies of various attractions are collected. Since I prefer to look at the originals, I didn't go to the park.

Market. All Chinese cities have many similar bazaars in different parts of the city. Bargaining is appropriate.

The prices are impressive. For 10 yuan (50 rubles) you can buy, for example, 7 pairs of socks or slippers. Or a bra.

It's time to start talking about transport. China's transportation system is the best in the world. One look at a typical Chinese train station is enough. If we remember that recently the Minister of Railways of China was sentenced to death for corruption and theft, one can already imagine the size of Mr. Yakunin’s fur storage facility <i>Yakunin was the head of Russian railways; it was discovered he had a secret huge mansion with a separate storage facility for furs, which became a meme</i>.
<p/>

<p>
The station in Shenzhen is larger than all Moscow stations combined.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254769242_0cf8b141e5_o.jpg">
<p>
It takes at least 15 minutes to walk from end to end.
<p/>

<p>
Just twenty years ago, there were no fast railways in China, and the number of passengers was declining. Today you can ride across the entire country at a speed of 300 kilometers per hour. There are no such trains in Russia, and there won’t be for the next 1000 years. Trains compete with airplanes; at medium distances the speed is comparable, the prices are approximately the same.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255499971_2b72f1b042_o.jpg">
<p>
Tickets for high-speed trains must be purchased in advance (at least the day before), usually all seats are sold out.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256248404_839b2eece1_o.jpg">
<p>
In general, tickets are personalized, or rather, they contain a passport number (and the Chinese can use their electronic passports to buy tickets from vending machines). In reality, passports are not checked on high-speed trains; boarding is quick through the turnstile.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256248369_dba2400c69_o.jpg">
<p>
Every major city in China either already has a subway or is building one. Subways are made according to standard designs; the design of stations and trains in different cities is approximately the same and differs only in small details.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256247824_394237d83d_o.jpg">
<p>
The metro is easy to navigate; all signs are in English.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255703933_47791dc54d_o.jpg">
<p>
Since the distances are huge, it’s normal to ride 15 stops, change to another line, and ride another 10 stops.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254769157_973e7f8b47_o.jpg">
<p>
In all subways, tickets are reusable (hello to the Moscow metro, where a ticket for one trip is thrown away). In Shenzhen these tokens are used. They are somehow cleverly magnetized, at the entrance they must be pressed to the turnstile, like Moscow tickets, and at the exit they must be thrown into the hole. The ticket price depends on the distance, from 2 to 9 yuan (10-45 rubles, $0.30 - $1.5).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256544135_c320b13c07_o.jpg">
<p>
Ticket machines are quite intuitive, but in Shenzhen it is very inconvenient that they only accept 5 yuan notes and 1 yuan coins (and 0.50 yuan that I had never seen), and banknotes of at least 1, 10 and 20 yuan are not accepted. Interestingly, in Guangdong they mostly circulate 1 Yuan coins, while in other provinces I visited, they circulate almost exclusively in banknotes. Large banknotes are exchanged at the service center at the station.

City buses are for gurus. Here is a typical schedule; neither the arrival time nor the interval is ever indicated, only a list of stops, although buses run quite often. As you can see, stops are named not by streets, but by some objects (institutions, schools, hospitals, train stations, etc.), so you can use the bus if you know the exact route number, or if you need to get to the station, near which there is a stop, and this can be seen from the schedule.

<h2>Guangzhou</h2>
<p>
What do you do when you have one day to spend in a city of 14 million? I'm not used to this, but in China the scale of reality is expanding in real time. All that remains is to arm yourself with a metro card and make the most of the available time. We start from the station, it is even larger than the Shenzhen station.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256151351_baf703f841_o.jpg">
<p>
Guangzhou cannot be called a tourist center, since this city attracts millions of visitors primarily as a transport hub (China Southern Airlines' home airport is here) and a business center: industry is concentrated here and exhibitions are held (Canton Fair).
<p/>

We are going to Foshan. The city of Foshan is adjacent to Guangzhou to the west. Foshan has its own metro, one line, which several years ago was extended to the border with Guangzhou, so it turned out to be a historic unification of two metro systems into one. All Guangzhou metro lines are named by numbers, and only one is called Guangfo (Guangzhou + Foshan).

Beijing Street, the shops here are more impressive, but there are just as many people.

It's time to go back to the station. Several circumstances happened so that I missed the train. There were no tickets until the evening, I took the last two tickets for the departing bus and rode across Shenzhen by taxi, divided into two, the trip to the hotel cost 600 rubles / $20 (with the price of a train ticket about 400), so praise be to the low prices in China ! I took almost 200 photos in a day, which is a record.

<h2>Huizhou</h2>
<p>
I've already talked about <a href="../new-york">the worst hotel I've ever been to</a>, it's time to talk about the best, or rather, the most expensive. Meet Country Garden Silver Beach Resort, Huizhou, Guangdong Province, 5 stars. Room price is about $300 per day.

The last time I visited such resorts was in Sharm El Sheikh about four years ago. It was very unusual to be on the beach.
<p/>

<p>
There were almost no people on the beach. Firstly, the resort infrastructure here is still under construction; in fact, this hotel is the first one ready in the area, although I have no doubt that it will not be the last. Secondly, by Chinese standards it was cold in October, although in my opinion it doesn’t get that warm in Russia even in the middle of summer.

I was afraid that there would be nothing around the hotel except the highway and other hotels, but everything turned out to be better than I thought. There is something like a village around the hotel.

Construction has just burst into this village; now it is quite dusty and someone is constantly walking along the roads with building materials.

There are many shops around where you can see prices without tourist markups. I can assure you that the prices are excellent!

There is a hilly area in front of the hotel. I couldn't pass up the opportunity to climb there and was rewarded with great views.

They are also starting to post signs in English here. But if you look closely, you can recognize the good old Google Translate, or rather, Baidu Translate.
