<h1>Abkhazia: Gagra, Sukhumi, New Athos</h1>
<i>27-28 January 2015</i>
<p>
Abkhazia is usually put on a par with <a href="../south-ossetia">South Ossetia</a>, as our "brothers" who help resist the pro-American <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/tag/georgia">Georgia</a>. In fact, this only became so in recent years; before that, the Abkhazians were always quite hostile to Russia, and for good reason. Initially, the Abkhaz were Muslims, and therefore in the 18-19th century they sympathized with Turkey, not Russia. Georgians, on the contrary, being Christians, sought alliance with Russia and as a result, Georgia became part of Russia at the end of the 18th century. Abkhazia was located exactly between Russia and Georgia and resisted attempts to annex it to Russia, so Russia enacted the final solution: a significant part of the Abkhazians were evicted to Turkey, only residents of the mountainous regions remained, and the modern resort area on the coast became practically empty. Immigrants from Georgia began to populate it. It is interesting that another people closely related to the Abkhazians - the Ubykhs, who lived on the territory of modern Sochi - was eventually completely destroyed. The last speaker of the Ubykh language died about 20 years ago.

Like the conflict between Georgia and Ossetia, the Abkhaz conflict first flared up after the collapse of Russia in 1917. Then it ended with the establishment of Soviet power in both countries, but the mine had already been laid: at first Abkhazia was in the rank of a union republic on par with Georgia, then it was included in Georgia. In 1992, in response to the coup in Tbilisi, Abkhazia announced the restoration of the 1925 constitution, under which Abkhazia and Georgia were equal parts of the federation. Georgia sent in troops.

<p>
It should be noted that by the beginning of the 1990s, the Abkhazians themselves made up less than 20% of the population of Abkhazia, but in the war they turned out to be much more successful than the Georgians, although at first the Georgian army reached Gagra, i.e. took control of almost all of Abkhazia. However, the Abkhaz militia launched a counter-offensive, and as a result, Sukhum was captured on September 27, 1993; this day is celebrated in Abkhazia as Victory Day in the Patriotic War. Russia did not support the Abkhaz militia in that war, but volunteers from the Muslim regions of the Caucasus fought on their side, including Chechens led by Shamil Basayev himself, the future number 1 terrorist.

<p>
After the war, Abkhazia was initially blocked on both sides, but then Russia began to restore relations (as relations with Georgia worsened), in particular, Russian passports began to be distributed to Abkhazians. After the 2008 war, Russia recognized the independence of Abkhazia, and that’s how our once worst enemies became friends.

20 years have passed, but nothing has changed in Abkhazia. The country's population has been halved as Georgians have fled and houses are empty and crumbling. According to the tradition of the CIS countries, abandoned buildings are not demolished, but are left standing. Because of this, Abkhazia now looks as if it was subjected to nuclear bombing just yesterday.

I have already seen many former war zones. <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/tag/kosovo">Kosovo</a> and <a href="../chechnya">Chechnya</ a> were completely restored, in <a href="../south-ossetia">South Ossetia</a> abandoned buildings were demolished, while <a href="http://juan.livejournal">Bosnia</a> and Karabakh still show signs of destruction. But the level of destruction in Abkhazia is unprecedented. I can only compare it with places where reconstruction is not carried out for political and military reasons, such as <a href="../palestine">Hebron</a> in Palestine, Famagusta in Cyprus or Agdam in Azerbaijan

Abkhazia can be recommended to lovers of military tourism and stalking.

Time seems to have stood still here since 1992.

It's amazing that some places that look abandoned are even functioning, like this sanatorium, for example.

The paradise for fans of post-apocalypticism is in the capital of the country, Sukhum.

The huge station building, which hosted thousands of tourists during Soviet times, stands abandoned.

In summer, a train runs here once a day. It takes 6 hours to travel from Sochi, whereas if you cross the border on foot, you can get there in 2-3 hours. A new station was built next to the old station, to match the current low number of passengers.

A walk through any district of Sukhum, except the central one, will give you as many types of pain and hopelessness as you will not find in any city in Russia.

It’s amazing - the entire building is abandoned, the windows are broken, the walls and roof are missing. Someone made an office on the ground floor and sells doors and windows. As an illustration, I made solid brick windows in my office.

Abkhazia is a living illustration of the broken windows theory.

<p>
Since half the windows in Sukhum are broken, people throw garbage on the ground. Sukhum is the dirtiest city in the entire post-Soviet area.

There was a monument to Lenin here, and now this building stands as a war monument, with an order.

If everything is so sad in Abkhazia, why do so many people come here in the summer? There are several reasons for this. Firstly, Abkhazia is cheap. Previously, it competed with Crimea, but now, with the rise in price of the latter, there are no competitors left (until Russian tourists find out about <a href="../georgia">Batumi</a>). I stayed in the "private sector", the room cost 1000 rubles, and I stayed only for 2 days, they told me that if it was for five days, the price would be only 600 rubles per day. At the same time, the conditions were very good, much better than what I saw in the private sector of Anapa and Feodosia in 1999-2007. The room had air conditioning (which turned out to be very useful, because it could be turned on for heating) and even Wi-fi.

<p>
In Gagra, rooms are available for rent almost everywhere. A local feature is that the name of the owner of the house is written on the street sign.

<p>
Secondly, it’s still quite beautiful here. In terms of nature, Abkhazia is most similar to <a href="../montenegro">Montenegro</a>.

<p>
The average Russian tourist comes here for a relaxed beach holiday, so you can find a passage from the house to the beach, where there will not be a single ruin along the way. Although you will have to try hard, because the usual access to the beach is like this.

The embankment itself is decent (for reference: this and the previous photos were taken from the same point).
<p/>

<p>
Knowing how blind Russian tourists are, when they walk around any city with their eyes closed as part of an organized group, one can believe that they will hardly notice the dirt and devastation. Gagra is the most decent city in Abkhazia; after all, a lot is being built here.
<p/>

<p>
At the same time, the panorama of the city is defined by epic Soviet high-rise buildings. It is not clear why they were built at such a resort?

<p>
Abkhazia is the Caucasus, so squatter construction is popular here. A perfect example: several separate houses turned into one.

The most popular place for excursions is the city of New Athos, where a beautiful monastery has been preserved, which was recently even partially restored. Was:

In any coastal city of Abkhazia up to Sukhum you can relax on the beach, New Athos is no exception.

Apparently, few people make it to Sukhum, and only real daredevils venture even further east. I decided not to traumatize my psyche and also did not go beyond Sukhum. In Sukhum the beach looks like this.

The Abkhaz language has only two vowel sounds: long and short [a] (not counting borrowed words), but there are about 60 consonants, which are not easy to pronounce without preparation. “A” is also a definite article, so most Abkhaz signs begin with A.
