<h1>Germany: Füssen, Hohenschwangau, Augsburg, Lindau</h1>
<i>6-7 July 2013</i>
<h2>Hohenschwangau</h2>
<p>
Neuschwanstein Castle is located here. It is often called fairy-tale-like, but you most likely won’t see a really “fairy-tale” view from photographs (similar to Sleeping Beauty’s castle from the cartoon), since it opens from the mountain opposite the castle, where there is no road. This is the mountain on the right.

<p>
The side view, however, is not bad, although here you can see that the castle is quite large in width, and several turrets make up a small part of it.

<p>
All this can be seen from the bridge over the gorge.

<p>
Nearby is an ordinary castle.

<p>
To get inside, you need to buy tickets in advance via the Internet; on the spot you will have to wait about 5 hours for the tour to start. However, I don’t think that I lost much by not going inside.

<p>
Instead, I went to another castle (Schwangau Castle), located on the hill opposite.

<p>
The main reason why you should come here is not the castles themselves, but the opportunity to wander through the hills and look around.

<h2>Füssen</h2>
<p>
Füssen passed me by for the most part.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256310903_a471229e28_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You can see the city, but the bus and train schedules are designed in such a way that this is not very convenient.

<h2>Augsburg</h2>
<p>
I knew little about Augsburg; I only vaguely remembered Martin Luther’s “Augsburg Confession” from my history course. Luther himself was here in a dispute with the envoy of Rome, long before the Reichstag accepted Luther's principles. Luther lived in a monastery next to this church, but was eventually forced to flee for fear of arrest.
<p/>

<p>
In the center of Augsburg there is a beautiful labyrinth of red and white construction fencing.

<p>
The city is relaxed, people have picnics with beer right on the cobblestones of the central square.

As usual, it’s lively here in the evening.
<p/>

<p>
And in the morning it’s empty.

<p>
Here and there you can find small canals running along the edges of the streets.

The main attraction of Augsburg is the world's first social housing for the poor, built by a man named Fugger and named Fuggerei in his honor.
<p/>

<p>
We can say that this is the first commieblock in the world.
<p/>

<p>
I must say that German social housing is very good.

<h2>Lindau</h2>
<p>
There was commotion in Lindau. A gypsy orchestra performed opposite the station.
<p/>

<p>
The weather was great, everyone poured out into the street.
<p/>

<p>
I didn't expect there to be so many tourists in this rather remote corner of Bavaria.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256365816_6d1d862934_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Including Russians. To be honest, I learned about the existence of Lindau by looking at the map and wondering how to get to Liechtenstein cheaper. I decided that it was best to make the most of my Bavarian ticket, which gives unlimited travel on trains for the whole day, and get as close to the Austrian border as possible. Lindau is just the final station.
<p/>

<p>
Of course, I knew about the existence of Lake Constance (Bodensee), although mainly because of the memorable plane crash.
<p/>

<p>
People come here mainly to relax in sanatoriums.

The city itself, or rather its old part, is located on a small island. It's all tiny and cute.

In 10 days I traveled a lot on German railways. Although they are relatively often late (I've been late on a few occasions myself), the frequency of services, extensive network and convenient connections make German trains an incredibly convenient mode of transport. Especially if you know how to save money by buying day passes. If you travel in a group of 5 people, moving around the country will be incredibly cheap for everyone.
