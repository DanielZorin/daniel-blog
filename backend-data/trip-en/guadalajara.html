<h1>Mexico: Tijuana, Guadalajara, Guanajuato, San Miguel de Allende, Queretaro</h1>

<h2>Tijuana</h2>

Gritó Emiliano Zapata<br>
Quiero tierra y libertad<br>

Ah, Mexico. Tequila, Mayan calendar, salsa, sombrero, bandito-gangsterito, jalapeno, gold, tacos, Pancho Villa, mariachi, tortilla, Aztec pyramids, Las Zetas, mezcal, wow... And even Juan without land, about whom Victor Jara sang , and in whose honor my pseudonym was taken, was also from Mexico. This is one of the most significant (tm) countries in the world, so I couldn’t help but cross it from end to end.

For most tourists, Mexico begins in Cancun, the easternmost point of the country, but I started in Tijuana, the most northwestern city. The northern half of Mexico consists of deserts and mountains (much like the US states on the other side of the border), and is not very densely populated. Tijuana is the largest city near the American border, with several million inhabitants. On the other side is San Diego, a million-plus city, and an even larger Los Angeles, so there is plenty to do for everyone. Of course, business here is tailored to the needs of those who travel across the border. This is the queue for pedestrians, or rather, its tail. The border crossing at Tijuana ranks first in the world in the number of people who pass through it (and in terms of cargo volume, Laredo, another crossing between the United States and Mexico, ranks first in the world).

<p>
Why do Americans go to Tijuana? First of all, drinking. In Mexico you can drink from the age of 18, and in the USA - from 21, plus alcohol in Mexico is much cheaper. Secondly, medicine. America is famous for its exorbitant prices for medical services, so half of Tijuana consists of hospitals and pharmacies, to the point that dental offices are opened in the same format as a hair salon.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255622036_091a77a1a5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Other services, consumer goods, food - all this is 5-10 times cheaper in Mexico than in America, therefore, what is not prohibited by customs is a sin not to bring. There is also this consideration: let’s say you damaged the car. If you repair it under insurance in the USA, it will spoil the “insurance history” and you will have to pay more for insurance next year. In Mexico, they will repair it for cash, no questions asked.
<p/>

<p>
Only souvenirs in Tijuana cost the same as in the USA, and not like in the rest of Mexico.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255621881_d659fee6ba_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Hotels in Tijuana are slightly more expensive than the average in Mexico. I settled at the very bottom for $10.

On the left is a large boiler, which is used to heat water to wash.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257594264_8f224ba225_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Tijuana, of course, is visually very different from neighboring San Diego.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254892292_359f196e41_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is a real Latin American city, which can be unmistakably determined by the style of signage. It’s exactly the same in the Brazilian backyards.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256667670_5227f89693_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are real slums here in the bed of a dry river.

Mexico has a huge number of pay phones. I don't understand how they survived the advent of mobile phones.

<p>
But the license plates look like California license plates.
<p/>

<p>
After hungry days in the USA, I ate to my heart's content. Every dish in any restaurant or canteen in Mexico is served with regular and jalapeno sauce, lemons and peppers. There are also radishes and dry Doritos.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255827213_6592e556a5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Mariachi musicians played near the restaurant, although without the traditional uniform with a bow tie and bells.
<p/>

<p>
Tijuana airport is located across the road from the border. This is what the US-Mexico border looks like. They don't spare barbed wire.
<p/>

<p>
There are crosses hanging along the fence in memory of those who died trying to pass as an illegal immigrant? Illegal immigrants usually cross far into the desert. Just a few years ago there was limited control, and if you didn’t look like a Mexican, you could sneak into the United States without a visa, or ride as a passenger in a car, pretending to be drunk. Security gets tougher every year.
<p/>

Behind the junction you can see a line of cars at the border.
<p/>

<p>
“This is Tijuana” is written in the riverbed where the slums are.
<p/>

South of Tijuana is the California Peninsula. The American state of California was formerly called Upper California, and Tijuana is Baja (Lower) California.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256371044_284f0d6143_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The California Peninsula is a continuous, lifeless desert.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255622406_1699fff4fd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are large cities Only in the very south of the peninsula.
<p/>

Most of it is a nature reserve with views like these.

<h2>Guadalajara</h2>
<p>
The “baby duck syndrome” applies very well to travel. It is important which city you visited first in the country, because you subconsciously compare all the others with the first. In this regard, the first city in Mexico for me was not Tijuana, where I was essentially passing through, but Guadalajara.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256146796_fbbfac4d80_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Guadalajara is the capital of the state of Jalisco. The state has a strange motto, “Jalisco is Mexico!”, as if someone would dispute that.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255416692_d72a37cc19_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The state of Jalisco produces the famous Mexican drink, tequila. Unfortunately, I didn’t have time to go to the city of the same name, but blue agave, the basis of tequila, is even planted along the roads as a decoration.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257190580_ac378fc670_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The main attraction of Guadalajara is this building. The hospital is called Hospicio Cabanas.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257190325_6e4319ea48_h.jpg"/>
<p>
About half of the complex is empty corridors, courtyards and locked doors.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256895259_c29f3dc10f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The other half houses an exhibition of contemporary art. Here, for example, is a room with saucers.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256948198_e030705f16_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A yard filled with balloons in the shape of a globe. When I was at school, we had one like this in the gym. My favorite ball.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256895309_ec7412e62c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And here are applications made from old banknotes.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255417532_3869711565_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But the main thing here is the painting of the chapel. All walls and ceilings were painted by José Clemente Orozco. In the chapel, I secretly took only one photograph, which only partially conveys the artist’s unique style. This is probably the most interesting church painting I have ever seen. Even in the Sistine Chapel, I spent less time than here, looking at everything around me.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256895349_31c677d20f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Near the hospital there are strange humanized pieces of furniture.

<p>
There are four main squares in Guadalajara, adjacent to the main cathedral on four sides. The entire city, like most other Mexican cities, is built on a grid.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255416952_8b4e5b95fa_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I wonder why in Latin America they began to build cities on a grid, if this was not the case in Spain itself during colonization?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257189845_cef584d2dc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Guadalajara, by the way, was founded in 1542, around the same time as most major Latin American cities.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257189780_8bf9bd475d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Most cities in Mexico look like this: houses with 1-2 floors, painted in bright colors.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256346533_cc28fc7513_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And a lot of wires.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257190210_f9cb67742a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
If you are tired of the noisy city, there is a solution in Guadalajara: take the bus and go to the final stop.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257190685_733614470f_h.jpg"/>

From there you have a magnificent view of the canyon.

When I was in Guadalajara, I was lucky enough to attend a local festival. The festival completely baffled me. Various groups came on stage and sang songs... about Jesus! Absolutely all songs! Along with the songs and karaoke, the big screen displayed: “With faith we will build the impossible.”
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256894859_b50d9c3350_h.jpg"/>
<p>
People walked past with signs saying “Jesus, I love you!”, “Jesus died for my sins!”, “Jesus lives in my heart. And in yours?”
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256346383_ce33dbc073_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Song and dance ensembles performed right there on the square.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255417157_2e68ffad14_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And the square is the one opposite the cathedral.
<p/>

<p>
I went to a diner for dinner, got some tacos, one of each type they had (and they even had eyes).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255417242_c09b8c2aa8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And the concert continued, they still sang about the love of God.
<p/>

Next door, people were entertained by clowns.
<p/>

They called me “Putin’s son,” anyone who knows Spanish will appreciate the joke.

The traditional Mexican effigies that are made for the Day of the Dead have not yet been removed from another square.
<p/>

<p>
In general, in Guadalajara there is a party in the city center, almost like in <a href="../guangdong">Guangzhou</a>.

<p>
There are barkers in electronics stores, like in <a href="../belo-horizonte">Brazil</a> and <a href="../guangdong">China</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256345898_58fa1aea8f_h.jpg"/>

On Sundays, the main street is closed and the city goes out for a bike ride.
<p/>

<p>
Just like in Asia, here when the light is red, traders walk near the cars.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256147186_ed97b83bb2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But this is what I saw immediately upon arrival in <a href="../rio-de-janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>: acrobats at a traffic light.

<p>
They still use the ubiquitous payphones. At the same time, it’s clear why they are so short: they’re just the height of the local girls.
<p/>

Graffiti is incredibly developed in Mexico, even more common than in Argentina and Brazil.

Guadalajara metro, two lines. It’s interesting that you have to go through the turnstiles here by throwing coins into them, and they know how to count them, but they just don’t give you change. A similar system in <a href="../kazakhstan">Almaty</a> issues tickets on buses.
<p/>

All stations are marked with pictograms, for the illiterate.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256345953_1a95df6128_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also one metrobus line (as in <a href="../curitiba">Curitiba</a> and <a href="../indonesia-1">Jakarta</a>). Surprisingly, the metro card does not work on this metrobus.
<p/>

Three layers of street signs. The top one is very similar to the Soviet ones. New signs with similar designs are used across the country.

<h2>Guanajuato</h2>
<p>
There is a new addition to the list of incredibly picturesque cities. Meet Guanajuato.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256898644_3b1c884900_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Guanajuato is most similar to the Brazilian <a href="../belo-horizonte">Ouro Preto</a>. It also stands in the depths of the mainland in a valley, it grew thanks to the mines. And the colorful houses resemble favelas that have been put in order.
<p/>

<p/>

You can also climb up from the other side of the valley.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256350258_7b436ad48f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The houses here are underpainted, so they look just like favelas with bare bricks.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255421177_b07348b1e8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here in the mountains there are mines where silver is still mined.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256150991_a5431d57b3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Some of the mines are depleted and abandoned, but overall the city’s main income still comes from silver mining.

Unlike most cities in Mexico, the streets in Guanajuato are not straight.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256349993_9017a4eaad_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But the houses are still colorful.

<p>
Despite its unreal beauty, there are very few tourists in Guanajuato. Apparently, five hours is a long drive from Mexico City. It takes 4.5 hours to drive from Guadalajara.

There used to be a river in the middle of Guanajuato, as in almost any city in the world that is not located on the sea, and there were periodic floods in the city. Now the river has a different bed, and the old one is a kind of basement under the houses.

Since Guanajuato is a World Heritage site, any bright signs are prohibited in the city center. The Subway name is not prominent on the building.

But what impressed me most was this kind of balcony protection. You sit like this, admiring the sunset from the balcony and the thorns in the corners at the same time.

<h2>San Miguel de Allende</h2>
<p>
In Mexico they love to name streets and cities after political figures. In terms of the uniformity of urban toponymy, Mexico can easily compete with Russia: we have Lenin, Kirov, Soviet streets, they have Hidalgo, Juarez, Madero, Obregon streets. Unlike Russia, where cities were given new names, in Mexico the name was prologated: for example, Oaxaca is officially called Oaxaca de Juarez (in honor of the famous native). The city named after the Archangel Michael became known as San Miguel de Allende.

In those days, Mexico was outraged by the disappearance of more than 40 students in a small town in the state of Guerrero. The students wanted to rally against education reform, and the local cops, in order to get rid of them, handed them over to drug cartel bandits. This caused outrage in society, and discussions intensified on how to defeat the actual merging of the corrupt local authorities with the cartels.

In Mexico, all newsstands sell portraits of heroes of the revolution and civil war of 1910-1917, and heroes from different sides. It’s as if portraits of Lenin, Trotsky, Kolchak and Makhno were sold everywhere in our country.

Since San Miguel is a tourist city, most establishments in the center also have a tourist price tag, however, I also found an inexpensive eatery with Mexican food.

<h2>Queretaro</h2>
<p>
In the city of Queretaro, the hotel room was very poor, although cheap; to get Wi-Fi you had to go to the main square, fortunately it was a 5-minute walk; The situation was saved only by Jesus, who was watching what was happening.

<p>
The main difference between Queretaro and other Mexican cities is the new buses. In general, the city center is pleasant, it’s not for nothing that it was included in the UNESCO list, but not stunning. Therefore, I will take this opportunity to tell you a little about the history of Mexico, since two very important events took place in Queretaro.
<p/>

The first attempts to declare Mexico's independence from Spain began when Spain was defeated and captured by Napoleon. The father of Mexican independence is Miguel Hidalgo from the town of Dolores in the state of Guanajuato. A street in every Mexican city is named after Hidalgo. Hidalgo was a priest who raised a popular uprising of peasants and miners, but they did not know how to fight, and the Spaniards defeated them, and Hidalgo himself was executed. The next fighter for independence was Jose Maria Morelos, in whose honor one of the streets near Hidalgo Street is named (and two small states near Mexico City are also named after the two fathers of the nation). Morelos also did not achieve success. Finally, the third attempt, led by Agustin de Iturbide, ended in victory in 1821, Mexico became independent.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256878433_eb10b15cd1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Immediately after the victory, as usual, there was strife: Iturbide turned out to be a dictator, proclaimed himself emperor and arranged a coronation for himself, copying that of Napoleon. The emperor was dethroned a year later, after which Mexico was declared a republic in 1824. Taking a cue from the United States, the country was called the “United States of Mexico.” By the way, that’s what it’s officially called even now. Over the next 50 years, there was an unbroken chain of victories and revolts in Mexico: presidents changed on average every 9 months.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257423724_fec64e1db9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Particularly interesting in this regard is Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, who was president 11 times. He started out as a soldier of the Spanish Empire, dispersed the Mexican rebels, but then went over to their side. When the Spaniards tried to take Mexico back by force, he defeated them and thereby became the hero of the nation. Well, the heroes of the nation, of course, have the moral right to stage a coup.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256878498_2d0ae2fac5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Santa Anna's friend Valentin Farias, who was a noble liberal at that time, became the president; for example, he took away lands from the church. But a year later, the junta decided to change policy, adopted a new undemocratic constitution, dispersed parliament, and in fact Santa Anna established a dictatorship.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257423769_dc2731845c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It must be said that at that moment Mexico was not a single nation, but was a huge territory where different peoples (mostly Native Americans) ended up in one state because the Spaniards drew the border that way. Mexico was then twice as large as it is now, and included the territory of the modern American states of California, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Utah, Nevada and Texas. It is not surprising that half of the states distant from the capital did not appreciate Santa Anna's government and decided to secede. In response, Mexico City sent troops there and carried out a punitive operation.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257424084_4ebe756bc0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At that time, leading troops across the entire country was very long and expensive, so one state still managed to defend its independence. This was Texas. Texas by that time was half populated by English-speaking Americans who also knew how to fight. When Santa Anna's army reached Texas, they stormed the Alamo Monastery (located in the modern city of San Antonio), which was defended by 200 people, for two weeks. In the end, all the defenders were killed, but the Mexican army eventually fell into the cauldron, and Santa Anna himself was captured, so he signed the surrender and recognition of the independence of Texas. Returning back to Mexico, he immediately retracted this recognition.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256677856_4e11562e86_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At this time, the French landed an army in Mexico to force the Mexicans to pay their debts. In the battle, Santa Anna lost his leg and then walked on a piece of wood. However, they still lost the war. Santa Anna, however, again staged a coup and tried to carry out a punitive operation in Texas, as a result of which Yucatan separated, and in Texas they began to think about joining the United States. Having destroyed the country and plundered its budget, Santa Anna fled to Cuba. A year later, in 1846, things finally came to war between Mexico and the United States.
<p/>

<p>
The war with America was a complete disaster for Mexico. The country was already dilapidated, but the Americans had a good army. Santa Anna from Cuba promised to yield everything to the Americans if they allowed him to return to power. Needless to say, he cheated everyone? In the end, Mexico still lost, the Americans took Mexico City and took away half of the country's territory, and Santa Anna again went into exile.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257720260_c614644c0c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
However, a few years later he staged a coup again and returned to power. This time he was no longer content with the title of president, but called himself “dictator for life” and “Your Excellency.” Santa Anna said he needed money to raise an army and take revenge on the Americans, so he sold more territory along the border to the US for $5 million. After that, he stole the money and went for a trip to Cuba for the last time. Twenty years later, having failed to raise the money in America to return to power in Mexico, he took advantage of the amnesty and came to Mexico City, where they paid no attention to him.
<p/>

<p>
The wheel began to turn without Santa Anna. A civil war began in the country between liberals and conservatives. The leader of the liberals was the new hero of the nation, Benito Juarez, after whom a street is now also named in every city. In the end, the liberals won, but they once again bankrupted the country, and France once again demanded payment of debts.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256878613_63d7936aa5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
France was ruled at that time by Napoleon III, who really wanted the glory of his uncle (in the end, this ended in failure for him in the war with Prussia). He decided to take over Mexico and place his man, the Austrian Prince Maximilian of Habsburg, on the throne. The French were successful, and in 1862 Mexico became an empire for the second time.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255949437_8350d3890f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Emperor Maximilian turned out to be a very liberal ruler, a supporter of a constitutional monarchy. This alienated the strong-arm conservatives from him, and the liberals in Mexico already had their own leader in Juarez, who did not accept defeat. The only reason why the emperor remained in power was the presence of French troops and the absence of American troops, who at that time were busy in the American Civil War (1861-1865).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256677821_053f75eabb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
As soon as the US war ended, French troops left. Maximilian turned out to be a romantic and decided to stay, to show himself as a Mexican patriot. The Mexicans did not appreciate it, Maximilian's army capitulated in Queretaro, and the emperor was arrested and kept in this monastery:
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257423859_559a020bec_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The court sentenced the former emperor to death, and the sentence was soon carried out. Now on this site there is a chapel built with Austrian money.
<p/>

<p>
Initially, the emperor was buried there, but later the body was transported to Vienna and buried in the same church where the Austrian emperors are buried.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256677786_a7a392129d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Benito Juarez returned to power in Mexico and finally separated church and state.
<p/>

<p>
After Juarez, Porfirio Diaz came to power in 1876 and ruled the country for 34 years. With him began the era of Stability (tm), which ended with a revolution and another civil war.
<p/>

<p>
And as a result, in Queretaro, in this theater, the Mexican Constitution was signed, which is considered the end of the period of revolution, but that is a completely different story.
