<h1>Order of Malta</h1>
<i>12 January 2017</i>
<p>
So, it's time again to discuss the favorite question of travelers: what is considered a country? The Order of Malta has a lot of signs of a state: in addition to its own currency, postage stamps, license plates and similar little things, it has diplomatic relations with most countries of the world, and its own passports, that are issued to the top knights of the order and are fully recognized in developed countries. It just has no territory of its own since Napoleon expelled the order from Malta, and then the British took the island. The territory of the Order of Malta is two buildings in the center of Rome, which, however, have the property of extraterritoriality, that is, their status corresponds to embassies.
Why this order is needed is not very clear. Most likely, this is just a toy for lovers of sonorous titles, but, as they love in the modern world, with a claim to making the world a better place. Until recently, only people of noble origin were accepted there (and Russians, Chinese and other Papuans a priori cannot be nobles by European standards), now they can be accepted by recommendation. The information about the activities of the order is vague: they write about some supposed “charity”, but we all know that helping some suffering children in Africa is just a money funnel with little real benefit to the world.

The first building is the Grand Master's Villa. Located near the Roman Forum. Here is the main gate.

They have the famous keyhole, in which three countries are visible: the avenue in the Order of Malta, Rome in the distance, and the dome of St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican.

<p>
And indeed, that is how it is.

In addition, everything here is closed behind a fence.

I tried to jump higher to see what was there. The villa appears to be on the right.

But someone from the Order of Malta drove out, pay attention to the license plates on the car.

The second building is the Maltese Palace, a stone's throw from Piazza di Spagna (Condotti Street).

<p>
Under the hood - is this already the Order of Malta, or not?

This is definitely the Order of Malta. This is the courtyard. You can sneak there after someone, but the doormen won’t let you go further than the courtyard.

<p>
There are doors on other sides of the building too. Behind one of them there used to be a post office, but it is now closed.

<p>
But the entrance at the back is open, there’s not even any security.

It says "ambulatorium".

Inside. The post office is now behind the door on the left, but it was closed.

On the walls are photographs of noble knights against the backdrop of the inhabitants of Africa unbearably suffering from hunger and cold.
