<h1>Poland: Warsaw, Bialystok</h1>
<i>4-12 August 2016</i>
<h2>Warsaw</h2>
<p>
I was stuck in Warsaw for more than a week, mostly in an area across the Vistula River called Praga. Only on the very last day did I get out into the historical center - that’s how it sometimes happens.

<p>
In Praga you can see pre-war buildings, which are practically not preserved in the city center.
<p/>

<p>
And also, of course, apartment buildings.

Entrance in Polish is "klatka".

<p>
New architecture.

<p>
I don’t know how miraculously Soviet advertising survived.
<p/>

<p>
These are the kinds of landscapes you can sometimes see in Poland.

<p>
Almost in the very center of Warsaw there are stalls that were demolished in Moscow.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256482669_e14a106e44_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Advertisements are posted en masse on the wall.
<p/>

<p>
There are a lot of alcohol stores within walking distance, and here they are open around the clock.

Poland is the only European country where sunflower seeds are sold.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255937128_57a499e382_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I found a sticker on the street with the inscription “You get a fine for parking your car badly” and took it to my collection. The Polish words chuj (dick) and chujowy (fucking terrible) are the same as in Russian.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255936428_3e1a4953fb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The local folks really don’t like Putin, and here they clashed with the Russian folks.
<p/>

<p>
They don't like embroidery here either.
<p/>

<p>
The center of Warsaw looks good from the river, the skyline is already emerging.

<p>
In fact, some of the high-rise buildings are still Soviet. McDonald's and Coke advertisements look funny on them, just like in the photographs of Novy Arbat from the late 1980s.

Everything is the same in the center.

<p>
I didn’t buy waffles in Brussels - it’s expensive, but it’s cheaper here.
<p/>

<p>
For so many days I became very familiar with the assortment of this store. In Poland you can buy food really cheap.

<h2>Bialystok</h2>
<p>
The city of Bialystok is located near the border with Belarus. In 1939, it was even annexed to the USSR after the division of Poland along with Brest, Grodno, Lviv, but after 1945 it was transferred to the newly created Polish state.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256126103_2b035e2deb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The border with Lithuania is also nearby, I was seriously considering whether to spontaneously take a ticket to Kaunas instead of the Belarusian border.
<p/>

<p>
They sell hardcore omelettes near the station.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256126188_eeee6791a1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The station faces the residential area, to get to the center you need to go in the opposite direction. Because of this, I even got lost.

<p>
On the way to the station there is an unusual church in the modernist style.

<p/>

<p>
What do you think this is?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256968500_8a9ec4af6a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The map says that this is a monument to travelers.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255195757_1db1ecff67_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At the foot of the cathedral there is a monument to those killed in the plane crash near Smolensk. In Poland, everyone is sure that President Kaczynski was killed by the KGB.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256968540_9ca52ea7f2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also an Orthodox cathedral here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256674134_e5326c4cc3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The monument is clearly from communist times with the inscription "God, honor, homeland."
<p/>

<p/>

<p>
Look carefully.

Does the doll look suspiciously like Putin?

<p>
The central square has been well restored.

There are bas-reliefs on many of the walls.

<p>
Palace of local oligarchs of the 18th century. Of course, like any palace, it is compared to Versailles.

In general, it is quite possible to walk for several hours in Bialystok.
<p/>

<p>
From here I went by train to the town of Kuznica-Belostocka.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256674399_2932ac536b_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Kuznica</h2>
<p>
Along the way we passed the town of Sokówka with its fabulously broken down train station. Most of the passengers got off here, only a few went to the border.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257075004_462a9f8d12_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The police received us immediately upon exiting the train. For some time they examined our passports and even ran them through some database using a tablet, while at the same time asking several times questions about what I was doing in Poland and what my home address was in Moscow.
You cannot cross the border on foot, although some time ago there was such a great opportunity, and you can even see a closed passage for pedestrians. At the border, the Russians also aroused a lot of interest; every border guard and customs officer considered it his duty to ask when I entered, and why I didn’t have a Polish entry stamp (although I had a fresh Spanish visa and a Spanish bold stamp right next to it; it seems that the concept The Schengen zone is not fully understood here). It felt like I was crossing the border of Congo and Burundi, where a Russian passport, or indeed any foreign one, had never been seen.
<p/>

<p>
Kuznica is quite a village.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255597687_7359b33043_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But there is still one monument here.
<p/>

<p>
In general, people come here for two purposes. Firstly, you can order goods to be delivered to the local post office, so as not to wait for them to be checked at postal customs.
<p/>

<p>
Secondly, a large “Bedronka” store was built near the border, where Belarusians go to shop.
