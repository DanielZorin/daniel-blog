<h1>Russia: Tula, Yasnaya Polyana</h1>
<i>13-14 October 2013</i>
<h2>Tula</h2>
<p>
The main thing that catches your eye in Tula is that all the pillars in the city are painted in the colors of the Serbian flag.
<p/>

Serbian flags are everywhere.

Tula is also the pride of Russia. And not only thanks to the obvious gingerbread, samovars and pistols.
<p/>

<p>
For example, in Tula all public transport stops are signed (as in <a href="../kazan">Cheboksary</a>).

At a major stop there is an electronic sign, Moscow nervously smokes on the sidelines.

There are also kind, helpful people in Tula who help tourists understand the local minibuses.

Unfortunately, it would be a shame to hang a historical certificate on some buildings.

Of all the Kremlins I have seen (and I have seen almost all of them, about 15 of them), Tula is most similar to Moscow. The "teeth" are the same.

What do you think is shown in this picture? I immediately see at least three possible explanations, but I think there are even more.

Probably mid-October is the best time to visit Yasnaya Polyana.

The entire road is clogged with parked cars of Moscow tourists. There are no sidewalks, just like in America!

I wonder how much apartments cost in this building, right opposite Leo Tolstoy’s estate? I suspect a lot.
