<h1>Kazakhstan: Petropavl</h1>
<i>20 January 2019</i>
<h2>Petropavl</h2>
<p>
For the second time I visited Kazakhstan. Petropavl (formerly Petropavlovsk) is the northernmost city of Kazakhstan. The southern branch of the Trans-Siberian Railway passes through Petropavl. It was originally the main one, but now the northern branch, passing entirely through the territory of Russia, is much more used. However, a number of long-distance trains pass here too; for example, I traveled on the Kislovodsk-Omsk train. Border control in this section is simplified: those traveling in transit do not have their passports stamped, and border guards purposefully approach only those leaving in Kazakhstan. Russian control takes place at a small station near the border; upon entry, Kazakh border guards board at the next small station on their territory, and upon exit, they stamp passports upon landing in Petropavl. Physically, the tracks at the station are not fenced off, as in Vilnius for Kaliningrad trains; perhaps you can slip through there unnoticed.

There are many colorful exchange offices around the station, it is immediately clear that there is a different currency here.

I rented an apartment for $17 a day, this business is well developed here, as in Russian regional centers.

Historically, Petropavl was a Russian city, roughly from the same era as neighboring Kurgan and Omsk. The Russian population here is still more than 60%.

Of course, the appearance has a lot in common with Russia, but there are a huge number of typically Kazakh details.

Although the residents of Moscow probably know Abai well, we also have a monument to him, which in a sense has gone down in history. In Petropavlovsk, Abai and Pushkin stand side by side. But there is no monument to Lenin in the city; in Kazakhstan they were either removed completely or moved to the outskirts.

Father Frost and Snow Maiden, it seems, are also a little Kazakh.

Central Mosque (opened in 2005). All cities in Kazakhstan have these, mostly built relatively recently. The architecture is quite recognizable and characteristic of this country. There are also several smaller mosques around the city dating from the 19th and 20th centuries.

Cinema "Kazakhstan" Latinized its name. Since 2017, the Kazakh language has been gradually translated into a new script based on the Latin alphabet.

But the vast majority of inscriptions are in the old Cyrillic orthography.

At that time, Nursultan Nazarbayev was still the president of Kazakhstan, but there were no portraits of him on the streets anywhere, that’s the only thing I noticed.

The largest shopping center (at least in the city center where I was). In the supermarket you can buy goods from Europe and Ukraine that are not on sale in Russia, although not particularly cheap. I personally bought delicious “Kazakhstan” chocolate, which is even sold by merchants on station platforms.
