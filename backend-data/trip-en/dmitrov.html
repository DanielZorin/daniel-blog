A completely shameless monument to the frog princess. If you walk around the fountain, each sculpture will look more depraved than the previous one.

In Dmitrov, unlike Zaraysk, everything is in order with demographics. The entire bridge is covered with locks.

This was the first time I saw a scam machine: you throw a coin, and with some probability you get a PROFIT. Of course, the product of probability and winning size is less than 1.

<h2>Yakhroma</h2>
<p>
On the other side of the Moscow Canal, the places are quite wild. First comes the village, then the field. Then, 5 kilometers later, the city of Yakhroma. In the village on the banks of the Yakhroma River, everything is equipped for relaxation.

But the channel itself is not intended for swimming. The water is clean, but the descent consists of concrete slabs, and at the bottom they are very slippery. An attempt to touch the water ended with swimming in clothes and climbing out with the help of a tree branch on the right.

On the bank of the canal stands a monument to victims of repression, a rare sight in Russia, where it is customary to erect monuments to executioners, not victims.

Speaking of bridges. An unexpected great solution: benches every couple of dozen steps to make it easier for older people to climb.

A carriage left over from time immemorial, literally rooted into the ground. Oddly enough, no one even lives inside.
