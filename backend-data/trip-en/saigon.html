<h1>Vietnam: Dalat, Mui Ne, Ho Chi Minh City</h1>
<i>16-22 August 2015</i>
<h2>Dalat</h2>
<p>
For the average person living in Russia, where 95% of the territory is cold most of the year, a vacation is equivalent to a trip to the sea, where it is hot and you can sunbathe in the sun. If you live in the tropics, where it’s  40 outside every day, then the best vacation is to go as far as possible from the sea inland, where the temperature in the mountains is  20. European colonialists quickly realized the trick and began to build cities in such places with a comfortable climate. Welcome to Dalat - the most comfortable and pleasant city in Vietnam!

A plane ticket from Hanoi is inexpensive - about $50. The bus ride to Da Nang takes all night.

<p>
Dalat, like hundreds of other cities around the world, is called “little Paris”. Not very similar, although there is some resemblance to the Eiffel Tower.
<p/>

<p>
There are several pompous buildings here.
<p/>

<p>
And beautiful winding streets.

Girls sell spirals, I remember they were popular in the 90s, you could throw them down the stairs so that they would turn over from step to step. Here they have a "head".
<p/>

<p>
In Vietnam, unlike neighboring countries, it is very easy to see people wearing traditional cone-shaped hats and carrying goods on a yoke.
<p/>

<p>
In general, Dalat is cheap, cheaper than capitals and resorts. Hotels for $6-7. There is no air conditioning, but a blanket is more important here, not an air conditioner.
<p/>

There is a little communism in this bourgeois town in the face of the clock tower.

The word Huy appears very often on signs in Vietnam. Google translator translates it as “cancel”, but probably the meaning is broader.

<p>
There are a small number of Russian tourists in Dalat, mostly on excursions from the nearby popular resort of Nha Trang. There is even one inscription in Russian especially for them, opposite the main attraction.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255314917_f5f6838ec0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And the most famous place in Dalat is the Hang Nga Hotel, also known as the Crazy House.

The authors decided to take the jackpot for the most kitschy building in the world.

<p>
Therefore, buildings and floors are added here, without limiting imagination in any way, creating a sort of Hogwarts castle.
<p/>

<p>
There is an opinion that while the building is under construction, taxes do not have to be paid, so the construction does not end. You can look into some of the buildings under construction.

The main theme is unity with nature, so most of the buildings look like trees and branches.

Staying in an ordinary room is not that expensive for such an iconic and unusual place - about $35. Just need to book in advance. Next time I'm in Vietnam, I'll definitely do this.
<p/>

<p>
Apparently, you can only check in after 6 o'clock, when the entrance to tourists closes. But in the morning, there is probably a problem with the fact that people will constantly look into your window.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255314922_e993d98c48_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But you can wander around the area in the evening and at sunset. The views from the upper floors are exceptional.

<h2>Mui Ne</h2>
<p>
There are two main resort areas in Vietnam: Nha Trang and Mui Ne. I visited the second one. For some reason, almost exclusively Russians vacation in this city, as in Antalya and Sharm el-Sheikh. In most shops and restaurants, everything is written in Russian, and in English equally, very rarely in German.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257387684_9f2bd0e25e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The main part of Mui Ne consists of large hotels in which you can live without leaving the territory at all. There are shops on the second line, everything is quite similar to Egypt.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257683420_2feab8c64b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Further north, the big hotels end, and there are more cheap accommodations, mainly on the second line, that is, across the road from the sea. For some reason, it is very important for many holidaymakers that the hotel is on the first line; even a five-minute walk across the road is too much. And on the second line, such a luxurious room costs only $8.
<p/>

<p>
Here, however, everything is not so rosy - in many places the descent into the sea is something like this. Of course, for a person who has been to Crimea, this is not scary, but for those spoiled by <a href="../luzon">Philippines</a> it’s somehow not very good.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257387594_f8577f3a71_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256640236_12d682950c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And large hotels can also ask for money for access to the beach, although in fact it is public, and you can lie on the sand for free. We'll have to go around.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257683670_9ea4c521a3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The sea is not very azure, there are a lot of waves. This, on the other hand, attracts surfers here.

<p>
They also sell jewelry. Probably, it is the sale of jewelry to tourists that makes the biggest profit, which is why all excursionists are constantly taken to jewelry factories.
<p/>

They sell Alenka chocolate inside. It is expensive: 81,000 dong for a large tile = $4 or about 300 rubles.

It is located away from large hotels, but there is also a menu in Russian.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256640281_a010dd7c6a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The translation is not very good.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256640296_149a6201c8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But the prices are very good. Only snake (cobra) is expensive - it is a Vietnamese delicacy, it costs $70.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256808386_a0df908f1d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Five course lunch with drinks. How much does it cost?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255912012_19e748a685_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Fresh pineapple - 20k
Fresh pitaya - 25k
Noodles with squid - 40k
Shrimps with vegetables - 50k
Grilled frog - 55k
Cream soup with shrimp - 40k
Garlic bread - 15k
Total 245k or about $11.
This is not the cheapest restaurant by Vietnamese standards (portions, for example, are not very large), but it is far from expensive either.
<p/>

<p>
In the evening we ate fried crocodile. I have already tried crocodile in the USA in <a href="../texas">New Orleans</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256841783_6b0fd4ecba_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There such a dish cost more than $20, like any other dish in even the cheapest American restaurant. And here it's less than $3. Eh.
<p/>

<p>
In Mui Ne, the beach is far from heavenly, but it’s really cheap for a beach resort, so I can recommend it.
<p/>
<h2>Ho Chi Minh City</h2>
<p>
Usually, if a city has a population of more than 10 million, it means there is a lot of interesting things there, you can hang out for a long time. Saigon (aka Ho Chi Minh City) is an exception to this pattern. This is one of the most boring cities in the world, where there is almost nothing to see.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257237955_2866be52ee_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I spent three days in Saigon and did not find a single remarkable place there.
<p/>

<p>
Only the Pham Ngu Lao area, where cheap hotels are concentrated, is more or less colorful.

<p>
I tried to walk around other areas, but found nothing there except a couple of administrative buildings and a bunch of monotonous streets.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257238080_3197b04252_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are no skyscrapers either, a couple of imperfections don’t count.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256394133_5abb6afb4d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is surprisingly little Ho Chi Minh in Ho Chi Minh City.
<p/>

<p>
But there are all sorts of capitalist things. McDonald's in Vietnam, again, is only in this city for now.
<p/>

<p>
There are night markets of moderate interest; they are placed right on the roadway, barring car passage.
<p/>

<p>
I bought a cool-looking fruit to try (momondrica cochinchinensis), but it turned out that this thing is not very tasty, but rather medicinal, and it is better to drink the juice rather than eat it raw, and it looks like liver.
<p/>

<p>
There is only one thing worth seeing in Saigon. This is local traffic.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255465322_0d30aad0d6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
If you think that you saw a lot of motorcycles in Bangkok, Jakarta or Hanoi, then you are wrong. The heaviest motorcycle traffic is in Saigon. All other cities in Vietnam are nowhere near.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257237870_9b2357fc24_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Only in Saigon can real difficulties arise with crossing the street. There are several intersections (one of them is pictured in the photo) where motorcycles move in a continuous stream, also managing to drive on the crossing without colliding. In other cities there are a lot of motorcycles, but crossing the street is easy - you just walk confidently and slowly, motorcycles have enough space to go around you, fortunately they are small in width. But this won’t work in Saigon - here, as you can see, there is no gap at all between neighboring motorcycles, which means you have to practically jump over the wheels. The most reliable way is to avoid such intersections.
