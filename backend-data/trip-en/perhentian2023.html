<h1>Malaysia: Tanah Rata, Penang, Perhentian Islands, Kota Bharu</h1>
<i>21 April - 2 May 2023</i>
<h2>Tanah Rata</h2>
<p>
As part of my trip to Malaysia, I couldn’t help but go once again to Tanah Rata to walk through the tea fields.

<p>
It was unfortunate that the trip happened to coincide with the holiday of Eid al-Fitr (the end of Ramadan), because of this there were a lot of tourists everywhere. I spent the peak of the holiday in Tanah Rata. The hotel cost more than 100 ringit.

Once upon a time in 2015 there was a construction site behind it, but now there are several large buildings here.

It is, as always, very rainy in Tana Rata, and this must be taken into account.

<p>
Because of the holiday <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/661939.html">Mossy Forest</a> was closed, instead I climbed Coral Hill, so named not because of the corals, but in honor of the girl named Coral (who found the hill).
<p/>

Because of the rain that had fallen during the night, everything was wet.
<p/>

<p>
The place is steep, no worse than the mossy forest, but without bridges.

<h2>Penang</h2>
<p>
Penang Island is smaller and quieter than Kuala Lumpur, so it's a good place to stroll and dine among the colonial streets and Buddhist temples.

<h2>Perhentian Islands</h2>
<p>
The whole trip to Malaysia was very nostalgic and of course the final highlight was returning to the Perhentian Islands. In the 6 years since the last time, I have not found a better beach. And so I board the familiar ferry and half an hour later the familiar outlines of Little Perhentian appear.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52911500481_21a74f48fa_o.jpg">

<p>
But now they arrive not on the western coast of the island, but on the eastern, at Long beach, first entering the village and Big Perhentian. The fact is that a full-fledged pier was built on Long Beach. And next to it there is also a rather large hotel.
<p/>

<p>
Because of this (and the pandemic, probably), housing prices have jumped, and Perhentian is no longer a budget vacation spot. In 2016 I lived in the Tropicana Inn for 60 ringit, in 2017 in the D'Rock Garden for 90 with air conditioning (though it only worked at night). Now I was paying about 200 ringit per day ($50) for a house like in D'Rock Garden, but even without air conditioning! And it’s still relatively budget-friendly; in D’Rock itself, what I paid 90 for 6 years ago now costs 400.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52910925707_d1f52dc1a3_o.jpg">
<p>
I think that in the future you can consider options on the Big Island - now it’s even cheaper somewhere, and a taxi boat costs 15-20 ringit per person.

In the middle of the island, on a hill, a fairly large hotel is being built, from which there is even now a descent to one beach that previously could only be reached by swimming (I swam there and saw a ready-made stone staircase).
<p/>

<p>
But the other way is fine. In general, it feels like there are more people only on Long Beach, even here the beach is almost empty all the time, although it takes 10-15 minutes to walk here. I dived in, made sure the coral reefs and fish were there, and stopped being so upset about the price increase.

Apart from housing, the rest has not risen in price that much. A standard dish in a local restaurant used to cost 13-15 ringit, now it costs 16-19. A half-day excursion cost 40 ringit, became 50.

A station with wind turbines and solar panels on top. By the way, in 2016 I wrote that mobile communications on the island almost did not work, except for Long Beach and this station. Now the situation is better, but I still didn’t catch U mobile everywhere, even on Long Beach near the shore it’s good, but a little higher up it’s bad. The Digi operator worked more stably.

I went on an excursion, but this time I didn’t take pictures underwater, as I had done it <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/531004.html">before</a>. This time we were lucky to see many turtles and sharks at once.
