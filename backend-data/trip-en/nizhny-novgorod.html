<h1>Russia: Nizhny Novgorod, Gorodets</h1>
<i>25-26 May 2013</i>
<h2>Gorodets</h2>
<p>
There’s a lot you can learn by looking at bulletin boards in different cities. For example, in Moscow, riot police are busy breaking up opposition rallies, and in the city of Gorodets, Nizhny Novgorod region, riot police can take part in your birthday party.

Someone came to a very bad life, with three higher education degrees from England he became a tutor.

Tour offers in small towns are usually trips to monasteries in nearby areas or to the Black Sea coast. An interesting offer - a tour to Ivanovo for only 200 rubles, I am sure that a one-way regular bus costs more.

<p>
As usual, there are ubiquitous offers to take out a loan, with a whole week of grace period and 0.7% per day. But in cash, not by credit card.

<p>
Someone thought of putting up street signs in Gorodets with Old Russian font. Now the names of revolutionaries are written in this style.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257179415_61e3917f4d_o.jpg">
<p>
There are also old-looking signs on which the former names of some streets are mentioned.
<p/>

The bus schedule is surprisingly clear.

<p>
Here and there there are fancy placebo buttons that turn on the green light. The road is not wide, and there are few cars on it.

<p>
The slogan of the Gorodets trash bins is “For a clean city!” It's written everywhere. The city is really not dirty.
<p/>

Separate waste collection is being introduced.

Ships going on cruises along the Volga stop in Gorodets. Especially for their passengers, lurid wooden towers were built right on the embankment, which, however, were not working that day. In the city center, some historical buildings are well preserved, for example, this samovar museum.
<p/>

<p>
But in general, Gorodets is a city of rickety fences.
<p/>

Their concentration here is very high.

Some buildings have even gone underground.

Almost all the fences are dancing.

All these patterns are made not with paint, but with thin wooden plates.

<p>
In Gorodets, not all houses have a water supply; sometimes you meet people collecting buckets of water from a well. By the way, this is almost the city center.
<p/>

Bus station. There really is a dumpling cafe on the right, which is cheap and quite tasty.

The monument to Lenin is miniature and epic. And what's in the background? That's right, a falling fence.

<h2>Nizhny Novgorod</h2>
<p>
There are few places where you will find as much sparkling humor and creativity on the streets as in Russia. Can you imagine a funny advertisement or sign in, say, Germany? No. And in Russia they are at every step. So the story about Nizhny Novgorod will have nothing unnecessary, just like this poster says.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257610655_bd8fa41e43_o.jpg">
<p>
You're walking down the street and there are drugs advertisements all around. “Bookmarks” mean that the goods are not passed from hand to hand, but are placed in a hidden place, the location of which is communicated for non-cash payment. How this saves from provocations is unclear.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257610235_5236cde5e3_o.jpg">
<p>
You go further - someone is making fun of the little piglet Peter. In principle, it is quite convenient to travel from Nizhny Novgorod. There are direct flights to Europe, there is a train to Moscow in 5 hours and 500 rubles.
<p/>

In Nizhny Novgorod there is an oligarch who owns shawarma stalls painted in Pepsi colors.

The bus station is simply typical. By the way, bus stations in highly developed Hungary look approximately the same.

<p>
I'm walking down the street and I hear retro music playing, Michael Jackson. The cassette recorder is standing right in the window. Back in 1994, when I lived in a residential area, hits from bands like “Dune” were constantly playing near my entrance, and for this, people brought tape recorders with them. I also remember well that on the wall of the entrance it was written “Yeltsin”.

In Nizhny Novgorod, political propaganda appears on the walls. A sign that the standard of living is high, people think about politics.
<p/>

For some reason, Limonov's supporters (radical left National Bolshevist party) are especially active.

In general, the mood is optimistic.

There are even traffic jams in the city.

<p>
Let's walk along the main street. At the very beginning there is a monument to an employee of the Russian Post. I think his head should be painted pink, like Slowpoke's.
<p/>

<p>
There are a lot of statues on the street that everyone takes pictures next to, so there's no need for signs. The violinist lost his bow.

Entrance to the central bank. The outside of the building itself is also good, I recommend going and looking at it without being satisfied with the photographs.

At the other end of the street is the Kremlin.
<p/>

The Kremlin has a hell of a lot of mosquitoes and an exhibition of military equipment. I wonder if the inscription is authentic?

Local residents indicate the direction of travel to the governor ("pack up the suitcase and go to Moscow"). I remember that Shantsev was once elected vice-mayor of Moscow together with Luzhkov.

Nearby are Soviet soda machines. It turns out that they are preserved not only in Uzbekistan. They seem to be working, reconfigured to accept 10 ruble coins.

For some reason, in Nizhny Novgorod it is a day later than in Moscow. Or were the schoolchildren just out for the second day in a row?

<h2>Bor</h2>

Recently, a cable car across the Volga was built in Nizhny Novgorod.

It seems that there was a shortage of paint in the USSR, so the houses were left the color of gray bricks. If they didn’t spare the red paint, life immediately would become more fun. Does anyone really like that the door from which the newlyweds come out looks like this?
