<h1>Indonesia: Balikpapan, Manado, Ternate, Makassar, Surabaya, Bromo</h1>
<i>29 April - 10 May 2016</i>
<h2>Balikpapan</h2>
<p>
The Indonesian part of the island of Borneo (here it is called Kalimantan) is much less popular than the <a href="../../country/malaysia">Malaysian one</a>. Surely there are also some beautiful places in the interior of the island, but there are no normal roads leading to them (roads between cities appeared relatively recently), and there is no infrastructure. The development of tourism is not a priority for Kalimantan: oil is produced here, from which the whole country makes a profit. The city of Balikpapan recently received the title of the most comfortable city in Indonesia. Let's see why it is better than Medan and other megacities.

<p>
Balikpapan is the largest airport in Borneo and the sixth in Indonesia (after Jakarta, Bali, Surabaya, Makassar and Medan). Annual traffic is 7.5 million passengers. For comparison, in St. Petersburg, with a population 10 times larger than Balikpapan, there is 13 million passengers per year, in all other cities of Russia, except Moscow, there is much less. Though, de facto Balikpapan Airport also serves the neighboring city of Samarinda, 100 kilometers to the north, which is slightly larger in population and is the capital of the province. I was at this airport both on arrival and departure, and it was noticeable that it was built for the future and could accommodate more passengers.

<p>
There is a bus stop at the airport, but I didn’t find any buses to the city center there, only to Samarinda. I had to walk through the parking lot and onto the road. Local city minibuses already travel along it. The model is roughly the same as in other Indonesian cities and in Malaysian Borneo. The fare is 4,000 rupees; I got to the center with a transfer at a minibus junction station. Unlike other cities I know, in Balikpapan the minibus system is clearly numbered, and the minibuses going to different parts of the city are painted in different colors. This is already a step forward for Indonesia.

<p>
As in other non-tourist cities in Indonesia, there are not many cheap hotels here. I found  one on booking.com; a room with air conditioning cost $10 (130 thousand rupees). To get there you have to walk uphill, but the view from the window is good.

<p>
When you go for a walk around the city, you immediately understand that it was called well-maintained for a reason. Even in residential areas there are sidewalks; they are not broken or crowded with cars.
<p/>

<p>
The main street is generally chic for Indonesia.
<p/>

<p>
Also, there are no traditionally long traffic jams, the air is cleaner. And in this wilderness there is already a McDonald's and KFC.

But the city is not rich in attractions. The mosque is just new.

<h2>Manado</h2>
<p>
The island of Sulawesi is rarely visited by tourists, although it should be the top region of Indonesia. There is no overpopulation and pollution here, as in Java, the roads are many times better than in Sumatra, there are many attractions, and the best diving in Indonesia after the distant and very expensive Papua. I have only visited the two extreme points of the island; I want to go across it one day.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257459340_ad98424e8f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The city of Manado is located in the very north of Sulawesi. I expected that civilization would be missing, but here everything is quite nice, no worse than Java.

It is said that in Manado they eat dogs, their meat is called RW or Rintek Wuuk. I wanted to try it, since I didn’t succeed in <a href="../hanoi">Vietnam</a>, I went everywhere for two days asking where to find this, but no one admitted it. If they eat dogs here, they are very few, and it is not clear how to find them.

This means that they don’t lie that they eat dogs in North Sulawesi, but I haven’t found such meat in any catering establishment. Again I couldn’t eat dog while traveling.

<p>
Suddenly a group of tourists. On my way out, I even met a mini-group of foreigners with a guide. Out of interest, I googled, some travel agency offers an excursion with an ascent to this volcano for more than $100. I spent no more than 5 - two on the Manado-Tomohon bus and three on a motorcycle taxi to the top, and hitchhiked back.

In Tomohon, I again took a motorcycle taxi and drove 10 kilometers to the village of Linau, which also turned out to be very prosperous.

<h2>Ternate</h2>
<p>
One of the most historically interesting places in Southeast Asia is located in the outskirts of Indonesia.
Since ancient times, Europe and Asia knew about each other. Alexander the Great reached the borders of India, the Romans came into contact with the Persians, who knew about China. A thousand years ago, silk and porcelain from China were delivered to Europe along the “Silk Road” through Central Asia. Another important commodity that could not be obtained in Europe was spices. Nowadays, any store sells 100 types of seasoning, and in the Middle Ages even ordinary salt was a strategic resource, and some more sophisticated spices were the food of kings. They were supplied from India, where, in turn, they were brought from Indonesia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254885127_2408025868_h.jpg"/>
<p>
When the Byzantine Empire fell in 1453 and the traditional supply route through the Middle East was closed by an unfriendly Turkey, it motivated people in the very west of Europe to look for alternative routes. So the Portuguese reached India by sea around Africa, the Spaniards discovered America, Magellan traveled around the world, and eventually the Europeans reached the small island of Ternate - the only place in the world at that time where cloves and nutmeg grew. Well, not quite the only one - there is also the neighboring island of Tidore, which is only about 20 kilometers away. These two islands have been competing for centuries for control over vast territories around from Sulawesi to Papua.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256363704_8ac454a2d0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The first Europeans in Ternate were the Portuguese. At first, the rulers of Ternate considered an alliance with foreigners beneficial in the fight against Tidore, but gradually the Portuguese began to behave more boldly, tried to preach Christianity, overthrew the sultans, and as a result, in 1575, an uprising occurred and the Portuguese were expelled. After this, the Spaniards and the Dutch fought for the island. The Spanish were initially based on the island of Tidore and later captured a former Portuguese fort in the south of the island. The Dutch built their fort where the center of the island's capital is now. Eventually the Spaniards went to the Philippines (where they even founded the city of Ternate in honor of their former possession), the Sultanate of Ternate was relatively independent until Dutch colonization in the 19th century, and formally the family of sultans still exists today, as in many other regions of Indonesia, although without official power.
The decline of Ternate in the 18th and 19th centuries is due to the fact that cloves and nutmeg started to be grown in other tropical places, as a result of which the spices ceased to be such a rare and valuable product.

<p>
The Moluccas are now a very remote region of Indonesia, but Ternate is quite civilized, better than the Lesser Sundas. In the center of the capital (also called Ternate) there are several malls, even KFC got here. Two out of three mobile operators operate in Ternate (Telkomsel and Indosat).

<p>
The population of Ternate is Muslim, although in general there are quite a lot of Christians in the Moluccas. In 1999-2002, against the backdrop of revolution and crisis in the country, there was chaos and mutual massacre of Muslims and Christians in this region, but it hardly affected Ternate. Then the northern part of the Moluccas was separated into a separate province (previously the capital was on the island of Ambon). So that Ternate and Tidore would not be offended, the capital of the region was founded from scratch on the neighboring island of Halmahera. There it is on the horizon.

There is no beach in the city of Ternate, but you can dive right from the embankment. The water is surprisingly clean, although it would seem that the port is nearby. Pay attention to how many people are swimming.

Ternate is similar in size to the Philippine island <a href="../cebu">Camiguin</a>. It is about 40 kilometers in diameter, you can go around it in a day. In addition to the two forts in the capital, there are three more on Ternate. The first point is Fort Kalamata.

<h2>Makassar</h2>
<p>
Makassar is the largest city on the island of Sulawesi. My main task was to get to the Rammang-Rammang valley, which I successfully accomplished, so there wasn’t much time to explore the city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257445855_69efecc21b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is not enough information about Makassar in English. In Indonesia you often feel like a pioneer.
<p/>

<p>
The airport here is one of the largest and most modern in Indonesia. Buses under the ubiquitous DAMRI brand run to the city center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257446300_2c68b3a41f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I had a vague idea where to look for a hotel. It turned out that right from the airport bus stop there begins a street with many hotels (although most of them are not on online maps).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256601713_5ec27eafee_h.jpg"/>

Typical Indonesian hotel with average prices 120-150 thousand rupees. Air conditioned rooms.
<p/>

<p>
I went for the record and checked into this establishment, which doesn’t even have a sign. A room with air conditioning cost only 100 thousand, although it only had an Indonesian shower (read: bucket and ladle).

I expected Sulawesi to be a remote place without civilization, but it’s no worse than Java. All the same Indomaret stores, KFC eateries, shopping centers. This is what central Makassar looks like.

<h2>Rammang-Rammang</h2>
<p>
Sitting on a Lion Air flight from Padang to Jakarta, I glanced through the in-flight magazine out of habit. My attention was drawn to a lush photograph of a landscape similar to <a href="../hainan">Yangshuo</a>. From the accompanying text in Indonesian, I understood that the place seemed to be called “Rammang Rammang” and was located somewhere near the city of Makassar, where I was just about to go. I decided to find out where it was and how to get there, but there was incredibly little information. Even Lonely Planet didn't mention this place in any way, there were only a couple of incomprehensible reviews on the garbage site tripadvisor, which contained zero practical information. After googling in Indonesian, I found a post on someone's blog where the author wrote that he took a minibus from the city of Maros (a small town north of Makassar), and that renting a boat to Rammang-Rammang costs 150 thousand rupees. Fortunately, on the spot it turned out that the residents of Makassar knew this place well.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257171649_78dbeba08e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are three different places nearby: Rammang-Rammang is a karst valley, Leang-Leang is a place with rock paintings, and Bantimurung is a waterfall. Until recently, even on Google maps this region was marked incorrectly; Rammang-Rammang was indicated 30 kilometers from its true position, closer to Leang-Leang. If you travel on your own, it’s easy to get to the city of Maros by bus/minibus from Makassar, and there it’s easier to take a motorcycle taxi. To Leang-Leang go from Maros approximately to the east, to Rammang-Rammang - to the north. So first Leang-Leang.

<h2>Surabaya</h2>
<p>
Surabaya is the second largest city in Indonesia. It can't compete with Jakarta yet - there is little modern architecture, huge traffic jams, and no proper public transport. Surabaya can be compared with <a href="../sumatra">Medan</a>.

<h2>Bromo</h2>
<p>
Bromo is the most famous and visited volcano in Indonesia. The road to it leads through the vile city of Probolinggo, where in any form of transport they brazenly extort you, no matter which direction you go. From there you need to get to the village of Cemoro Lawang, standing on the edge of the caldera - a huge pit filled with volcanic ash from three volcanoes: Bromo, Tengger and Semeru.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257004935_15dc577502_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the evening, Cemoro Lawang is sleepy and foggy. And cold - the temperature is less than 10 degrees, you need to warm yourself.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256161513_4f43d1a6b7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
99% of tourists visit Bromo with an organized tour. It looks like this: they are usually settled not in Cemoro Lawang, but a few kilometers earlier, then at three o’clock in the morning they are taken by jeep to the observation deck, where hundreds more of the same people will watch the sunrise. Then they take you in a jeep to a parking lot in the caldera, collect $20 for entry in addition to the hefty excursion fee, and from there you walk to the volcano. I wasn’t eager to get up at 4 am for some kind of sunrise, so I woke up like a human closer to 8 and walked to the volcano. If you do this, then no one will charge an entrance fee.
<p/>

<p>
There is fog below, above which two peaks can be seen. Actually, in all the photographs of dawn it’s the same thing, only taken from a different angle, because the lookout is further to the right from the point where I was.
<p/>

<p>
Because of the fog you can't see anything from below. By noon, the fog will rise higher, and nothing will be visible from the observation deck, so everyone goes to the volcano in the morning.

<h2>Banyuwangi</h2>
<p>
The most hellish city in Indonesia for me is Banyuwangi. First, I traveled as much as 200 kilometers in a terrible, smoky bus from Probolinggo at an average speed of no more than 20 kilometers per hour, so the journey took more than 10 hours. There are not many hotels in Banyuwangi at all, and in the area where the bus station is, there are almost none at all. I found one on the map, wandered around the small streets for a very long time, asking everyone for directions. In the end, it turned out to be the most terrible hotel, if not of all time, then certainly in Indonesia - the room was so hot and stuffy that it seemed like you were sleeping in a sauna under the ceiling. Turning on the fan was tantamount to suicide, or rather, catching a cold. The price of the room was around 120 thousand - the same as for a room with air conditioning in a normal city.
