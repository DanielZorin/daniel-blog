<h1>India: Cochin, Goa, Mumbai</h1>
<i>28 June - 11 July 2017</i>
<h2>Cochin</h2>
<p>
Welcome to South India! It has its own atmosphere: a little cleaner, a little richer, a little less people. Most Indian emigrants are from these parts (it’s for a reason that one of the official languages in Singapore is Tamil, and not Hindi). While in the north one empire replaced another, in the south goods were transported between China and Europe. The southernmost provinces became part of India very late, only under the British; before that they were not part of even the largest empires in the region. The languages of the south (Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada) are not related to Hindi, Sanskrit and other Indo-Aryan languages, and the letters are also completely different.
Cochin (or Kochi) is also a historical city; it was founded by the Portuguese back in the 15th century, when they first opened the route to India.

Vasco da Gama died and was buried here, although after some time he was reburied in Portugal in the Jeronimos Monastery in Lisbon. Tomb of Vasco da Gama:

And this is already a tombstone in Dutch nearby, because after the Portuguese, the Dutch owned Cochin.

Since those times, many Catholic cathedrals have remained throughout southern India.

The historical area is called Fort Cochin. It is located on a narrow peninsula; to get from there to the part of the city where the railway station and most of the population are, you either need to make a 30-kilometer detour by car/bus, or go straight by ferry.
<p/>

Fort Cochin consists of low-rise buildings with tiled roofs, nice.

The metro in Cochin was built recently! I was there literally a week after the opening. At that time, only about one third of the built line was open, trains did not yet run to the very center, the ferry terminal and the railway station.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256776404_cd3751a83a_o.jpg">

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255298422_907b688b01_o.jpg">
<p>
There were a lot of people in the metro; it seemed that many were still there purely on an excursion, taking photographs in the passages and at the stations. Even the always vigilant cops did not prevent this.

And here is the purpose of the trip to the mainland: the Lulu Mall shopping center, according to some sources, the largest shopping mall in India.

The shopping center is really solid, although it doesn’t strike the imagination; in Russia there are such in any regional center.

South Indian thali. In fact, it is not much different from other regions, but here it is most often served in round bowls, rather than in the recesses of a tray.

At the station there is a machine that sells tickets for local trains. A machine operator sits next to it, and presses all the buttons for you and issues a ticket.

<h2>Goa</h2>
<p>
Goa is not a city, but a small state of India, stretching over 100 kilometers from north to south. There is also the city of Goa (now called Old Goa) - a Portuguese colony, but when they say “Goa”, they usually do not mean it. For backpackers, lovers of yoga, drugs and enlightenment, Goa is the village of Arambol on the northern edge of the state; For tourists arriving on a package tour for a beach holiday, Goa is most likely the village of Morjim south of Arambol, or some less popular place on the coast. By the way, Goa as a resort is famous only in Russia; there are no more Western tourists (except for the relatively small category of backpackers) there than in other places in southern India, that is, very few. Tourists in Goa are approximately 90% Indian, 8% Russian and 2% all others combined; There are only about 800 thousand foreigners per year (of which quite a few are, in fact, Indian emigrants). For comparison, the island of <a href="../pkuket">Phuket</a> of comparable size receives 8 million tourists a year.
The first place to visit in Goa is the old town - a World Heritage Site.

The main city of the southern part of Goa is Margao. It is interesting to travelers primarily as the location of the railway station (there are other stations closer to the north, but most trains do not stop there, and getting to them is not particularly convenient). In addition to the station, there are also many Portuguese buildings preserved here, although the city is not as neat as Panaji.

Many old houses are abandoned and crumbling. This can be seen all over Goa; they say that some of these houses have been empty since 1961, when the previous owners were kicked out, and the state never figured out how to use them fairly.

The first days I was based in the southern part of Goa, specifically in the village of Benaulim (it was closest to the Margao station). The territory here is organized as follows: all settlements are about a kilometer from the seashore, there is also a through road. Each village has access to the beach; near the beach there are usually only restaurants with summer verandas (somewhere away from the villages there are also large hotels by the sea). On the way to the beach there are rice fields.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257170295_f66d0e5ea5_o.jpg">
<p>
Benaulim is a small village, but there is a supermarket, several restaurants and hotels. Signs in Russian.

What’s very cool about Goa is that Portuguese architecture has been preserved not only in small spots like Old Goa. There are a lot of these buildings, and they are everywhere. Here, for example, is the market place in Benaulim.

<p>
I was in Goa in July, this is the low season. Unlike Thailand, where you can and should come in the summer during the rainy season, because it’s cheaper and it rains an hour a day, here in the summer you won’t really hang out on the beach. I won’t say that the rains ruined my stay in Goa: for several days there were no rains at all, on other days I was still able to go to Old Goa, Panaji, and just walk around the towns, although sometimes I had to take shelter from the rain. So you can come here for a walk in the summer. But it’s clearly not worth swimming on the beach at this time: it’s cool, windy, very strong waves, and sometimes it rains.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255397622_8cc6de5ccb_o.jpg">

At first glance, Goa is quite clean, but from time to time there are pits like this with garbage along the roads.

A few days later I moved to the north. Since there is surprisingly little information about Goa in English, I didn't know what to expect. As a base, I chose a place called Anjuna: it is approximately in the middle of the northern half of Goa, and I assumed that there would be infrastructure there for foreign tourists, since I knew that on Saturdays there is a market in Anjuna, where everyone comes for souvenirs, in addition, there are clubs here. My choice was correct: besides Arambol, which will be discussed later, Anjuna is the second relatively “backpacker” place in Goa.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255399762_0074da2cd4_o.jpg">
<p>
The first thing I did, of course, was walk around Anjuna. This is access to the sea near the center of the village, where buses arrive.
<p/>

I finally made it to Curlie's. This place is located on the southernmost edge of Anjuna, behind it is a steep, impassable cliff. Getting here is not easy even on a motorcycle or on foot - you need to walk along a winding path through all sorts of backyards. Perhaps this was the plan, since it was Curlie's that hosted the first trance music parties that made Goa famous in certain circles.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256129881_80e1316e87_o.jpg">
<p>
Nowadays parties are no longer the same - round-the-clock parties seem to be prohibited. At Curlie's, numerous Indian tourists drink tea and admire the sea from the balcony. I also joined.

<p>
I devoted one of the days with good weather to exploring northern Goa. Alena rented a motorcycle (like most tourists), and I walked and took public transport the old fashioned way. I must say that I got to some places faster by bus. To begin with, I moved from Anjuna to the neighboring town of Vagator. You can get there on foot if you go through the top of this hill.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257172660_8cda507f61_o.jpg">

It is impossible to go further north than the fort, there is a fairly wide river, behind which is the well-known Morjim beach (where Russian tourists usually go), and to the north - Arambol.

Then, I went to explore further the coast south of the fort and Anjuna - right up to another river, beyond which is the city of Panaji. You can get there by bus with a transfer in the town of Mapusa - the transport hub of northern Goa. There are still churches along the way.

The most popular resort village in Goa is Calangute. That's what they say in guidebooks, and it's really true, but you're unlikely to like such popularity.

Since we are talking about food, I cannot help but say that in terms of food, Goa is the best place in India. There are many restaurants here, the menu is as varied as possible, there is meat everywhere (even beef!). Also, alcohol is sold everywhere in stores here (in other states it is usually only available in special alcohol stores, which are very rare, and in several states there is a prohibition law).

There is nothing to do in Arambol in summer; life is definitely better in Anjuna, where there are more establishments. The beach in Arambol looks like this, it’s a little gloomy now, but I think in sunny weather it’s quite pleasant.

<h2>Mumbai</h2>
<p>
Mumbai is India's largest city, richest and most economically important. This is the #1 city to visit if you come to India, like <a href="../new-york">New York</a> in America: not the capital, but essentially the main city. Under the British, it was also not the capital (which was located in <a href="../calcutta">Calcutta</a>, but as the main port of the west coast it was actively developing, and received its share imperial buildings. Mumbai is located on a long and narrow peninsula, with the city center in the south, but not at the southernmost point, as one might expect. The reason is that until the 19th century, instead of a peninsula it was a group of islands, the straits between which later were filled with land, and the city center remained in place of the island where it was originally located.

The most famous building, which is even a world heritage site, is the Mumbai CST station, which was previously named after Queen Victoria.

The Dharavi area gained some fame thanks to the movie Slumdog Millionaire. About 700 thousand people live here - on an area of two square kilometers! Getting here is very easy - the area is located between the Mahim Junction and Sion train stations, you can walk from one to the other through the entire slum. In terms of security, everything is fine here. It seems that people in Mumbai are used to foreigners, so you can only expect some kind of reaction from children; near tourist attractions you will get more attention.

The houses are very small in area, and there is savings on everything: for example, there is no space wasted on flights of stairs; the ascent to the top is made using an external staircase, under which there is still space.

In addition to the old, shabby trains, Mumbai also has newer public transport systems: the metro and monorail. The Mumbai monorail is very strange: the line goes from nowhere to nowhere somewhere on the outskirts, is very poorly connected to other modes of transport, does not go in a straight line, but in a large loop. For several years now they have been promising to finish the line to the city center, they announced the opening in the spring of 2017, in the summer of 2018, but things are still slow.

Well, in principle, residents of slums should be able to afford travel: unlike many metro systems in India, where travel is relatively expensive - 20-40 rupees, here prices are no higher than on buses: around 7-12 rupees, depending on distance.

Mumbai has really expensive hotels, not only by Indian standards, but in general, comparable to Hong Kong. And the room sizes are similar. For more than 20 dollars I rented a Chungking mansions-style room, but with air conditioning.

The main way to get around Mumbai (if you are not ready to take a taxi all the time) is the city train. It looks something like this from the inside. They say that during rush hour it is very crowded, but I didn’t get there: after all, I lived in the center and traveled from the center during the day, and not vice versa.

Tariff table. Travel within the city costs only 5-10 rupees, more only to very distant stations. There is also first class, where a ticket costs 10 times more. Externally, it is no different, except for the inscription “1st class”, but of course there are few passengers there. Tickets must be purchased at the box office each time, although locals have savings cards. Tickets are just paper, there are no turnstiles. My ticket was never checked.

Went to the flea market (Chor Bazaar). A curious place, they sell a bunch of all sorts of antiques, which for India are not even particularly antiques, but everyday items.

North of the market is the red light district - Kamathipura. I didn’t take pictures there out of caution, but there’s nothing particularly scary in appearance, especially during the day. I later read that in recent years the number of prostitutes in this area has decreased tenfold, so that now it can be considered a red light district with a big stretch.

In Mumbai, our paths temporarily diverged - Alena went by train to Delhi, from there immediately by plane to Moscow, and I flew south and explored India for almost another month. The train to Delhi departed from Mumbai-Bandra station and arrived at Delhi-Rohilla minor station. In general, many trains in Mumbai do not depart from the central stations, especially transit ones (from Goa we arrived in Thane). The train to Delhi was unusual in that there were no standard sleepers, and all the carriages were of air-conditioned classes. Moreover, the Bandra station is located in a remote area surrounded by lush slums. This is where I took my favorite photo in all of India - Disney's plywood Sleeping Beauty Castle in the slums.

By the way, to get out of an Indian airport, you have to go through an interview. My goal of going out to “eat at Burger King”, which is right in front of the entrance to the terminal, did not satisfy the security guards. Fortunately, there is a Burger King inside the airport after security, and the prices there are even the same as in the city. Respect to this airport!
