<h1>Georgia: Ninotsminda, Akhaltsikhe, Khertvisi, Vardzia, Borjomi, Kutaisi, Batumi, Stepantsminda</h1>
<i>6-10 May 2014</i>
<h2>Ninotsminda</h2>
<p>
The border between Armenia and Georgia (Bavra-Ninotsminda) was in complete wilderness. Outside the gates of the fashionable Georgian border terminal, an enchanting sight awaited: a complete absence of taxis, although I wouldn't mind one. However, quite quickly we reached relative civilization - the city of Ninotsminda, formerly Bogdanovka. Villages in Georgia are in complete ruin, in Ninotsminda it is no better. I was too lazy to photograph everything there in detail, but this shot should give an idea of Ninotsminda.

<p>
This is what this village looks like.

<p>
Here we were picked up by a truck (for the first time on the trip!), and the driver did not speak Russian (also for the first time), since the truck was Turkish and was heading to Batumi.

<h2>Akhaltsikhe</h2>
<p>
Not a bad city where I had very little time.
<p/>

<p>
The main attraction here is the castle on the hill.

The hotel was in a residential area.

This is already somewhere on the outskirts of the city, a typical picture for rural areas.

Excellent work. In terms of grandeur, it can be compared with the art near the city station of <a href="../vladimir">Vladimir</a>.

<h2>Vardzia</h2>
<p>
There are sometimes direct minibuses from Akhaltsikhe to Vardzia, but it was too slow for our schedule. Therefore, the plan was this: hitchhike about 40 kilometers along the Akhaltsikhe-Akhalkalaki highway, get off near the turn to Vardzia and take a taxi for the last 16 kilometers. This plan completely failed: in the village of Khertvisi, located at the fork, there was no taxi. Why is it that in those rare cases when a taxi is really needed, there isn’t one, and at airports and train stations, they cost ten grand each? But there was an excellent castle there.
<p/>

<p>
And also the confluence of two rivers and two mountain valleys. One of the rivers is Mtkvari, also known as the Kura.

A funicular is being built near the castle.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257015494_8e36ea4bca_o.jpg">
<p>
After walking near the castle, we decided that we should hitchhike further.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255538317_0f76269454_o.jpg">
<p>
This turned out to be no easy task. On Google maps the area generally looks like a desert, but in reality there are small villages along the way. Something like this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256466683_7ec587bd47_o.jpg">
<p>
In total, the road to Vardzia from the highway took almost two hours.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255538417_a5ae1a135a_o.jpg">
<p>
Since the distance there is only 16 kilometers, we can estimate that we walked 5-6 kilometers while waiting for cars to appear on the horizon.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256268591_17a007b46b_o.jpg">
<p>
But it was worth it.

Most of the passages into the interior are closed with bars, so visitors see only a smaller part of the monastery.

<h2>Borjomi</h2>
<p>
It's time to drink "Borjomi" mineral water in the city of Borjomi.

We barely managed to hide in the main attraction of Kutaisi - the Bagrati Temple (they are threatening to exclude it from the World Heritage list because Saakashvili restored it from ruins).

<h2>Batumi</h2>
<p>
Mikheil Saakashvili wanted to make a European-level resort out of Batumi. After his departure, these Napoleonic plans were curtailed, but a lot had already been done, so we can safely say that Batumi became the most civilized place on the Black Sea coast of the USSR (probably, Sochi can now compete for this title, but I haven't been there). There are no resorts on the Black Sea in Turkey; there are resorts in Bulgaria and Romania, but I can’t say anything about them. In the city center it is like Europe.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256948570_27b6b9ebe3_o.jpg">

<p>
They made bike lanes.

They built playgrounds, just like in Europe.

In general, Batumi is a rare example of a historical center that is almost not spoiled by the Soviet Union.

Since we're talking about food, you can eat in Batumi for ridiculous money (although a little more expensive than the Georgian average).

A cable car was recently built in Batumi. The view from the top is not great because the hill is quite far from the city center and there is not much around.
<p/>

Well, maybe an interesting cross.

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256107483_74195e25f4_o.jpg">
<p>
But riding a cable car is very interesting for the sake of the process itself, because the cabin passes over ordinary areas of the city, and it looks as if you are flying in a helicopter.

Literally a week after I passed through here, there was a mudflow, and the road was destroyed and closed for a couple of months, and three months later there was a mudflow twice as large.
