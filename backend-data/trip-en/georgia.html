<h1>Georgia: Ninotsminda, Akhaltsikhe, Khertvisi, Vardzia, Borjomi, Kutaisi, Batumi, Stepantsminda</h1>
<i>6-10 May 2014</i>
<h2>Ninotsminda</h2>
<p>
The border between Armenia and Georgia (Bavra-Ninotsminda) was in complete wilderness. Outside the gates of the fashionable Georgian border terminal, an enchanting sight awaited: a complete absence of taxis, although I wouldn't mind one. However, quite quickly we reached relative civilization - the city of Ninotsminda, formerly Bogdanovka. Villages in Georgia are in complete ruin, in Ninotsminda it is no better. I was too lazy to photograph everything there in detail, but this shot should give an idea of Ninotsminda.

<p>
This is what this village looks like.

<p>
Here we were picked up by a truck (for the first time on the trip!), and the driver did not speak Russian (also for the first time), since the truck was Turkish and was heading to Batumi.

<h2>Akhaltsikhe</h2>
<p>
Not a bad city where I had very little time.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255799611_bc54a01406_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The main attraction here is the castle on the hill.
<p/>

<p>
The main tourist areas have been cleaned up.
<p/>

<p>
Tiles, lanterns.
<p/>

<p>
The hotel was in a residential area.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256548084_e2287e4cf0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It's something like that there.

<p>
An interesting barn hanging over a cliff.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257456419_2efaf45eda_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is already somewhere on the outskirts of the city, a typical picture for rural areas.

<p>
The old ones are still dubbed in Russian.
<p/>

<p>
The store's decor remains from those times.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256548304_6085688694_h.jpg"/>
<p>
People in Akhaltsikhe love to paint fences.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256843545_3c581824c8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A very ancient cultural layer.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255070407_a72d1ebdb6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here's a new one.

<p>
Excellent work. In terms of grandeur, it can be compared with the art near the city station of <a href="../vladimir">Vladimir</a>.
<p/>

<h2>Vardzia</h2>
<p>
There are sometimes direct minibuses from Akhaltsikhe to Vardzia, but it was too slow for our schedule. Therefore, the plan was this: hitchhike about 40 kilometers along the Akhaltsikhe-Akhalkalaki highway, get off near the turn to Vardzia and take a taxi for the last 16 kilometers. This plan completely failed: in the village of Khertvisi, located at the fork, there was no taxi. Why is it that in those rare cases when a taxi is really needed, there isn’t one, and at airports and train stations, they cost ten grand each? But there was an excellent castle there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256268351_0a3325b53c_h.jpg"/>

<p>
And also the confluence of two rivers and two mountain valleys. One of the rivers is Mtkvari, also known as the Kura.

<p>
Village.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255538362_93bcfdb0ef_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A funicular is being built near the castle.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257015494_6895a7977b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
After walking near the castle, we decided that we should hitchhike further.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255538317_950dab4233_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This turned out to be no easy task. On Google maps the area generally looks like a desert, but in reality there are small villages along the way. Something like this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256466683_39ba7001b3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In total, the road to Vardzia from the highway took almost two hours.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255538417_1ed52af172_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Since the distance there is only 16 kilometers, we can estimate that we walked 5-6 kilometers while waiting for cars to appear on the horizon.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256268591_de6ccc95b9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But it was worth it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257015634_23501698a6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Cows graze along the roads.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257015659_75d6ec2c1b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And we keep going and going.

<p>

<p/>

<p>
Finally, Vardzia.
<p/>

These numerous levels and ladders create the feeling that you are in a computer game.

If you climb inside, there will be dungeons and dragons.

<p>
Most of the rooms are dead ends, these are the monks' cells.

<p>
Locker.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257896860_184a97fb54_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Part of the territory is still used by monks.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256441934_6da2d73566_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Most of the passages into the interior are closed with bars, so visitors see only a smaller part of the monastery.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256737820_6fd9c5ae41_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Amazing place.

<h2>Borjomi</h2>
<p>
It's time to drink "Borjomi" mineral water in the city of Borjomi.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256691724_e848a9254d_h.jpg"/>

<p/>

<p>
Next to the entrance they are building Europe, as in <a href="../kazan">Yoshkar-Ola</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255213272_52246172a3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It used to be a pretty standard looking resort.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256691584_e962147f20_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A fashionable bridge was built.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255213217_455d76d482_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The benches are new.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256144088_b533384df4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The signs were sponsored by the company.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256691859_49a0cca480_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But otherwise, this is a typical Georgian city.
<p/>

Streets lined with cobblestones.

Laundry is drying near the railway. Trains run very rarely.
<p/>

Streets with vineyards.

<p>
Incredible architecture.

Drink Borjomi!

<h2>Kutaisi</h2>
<p>
I just arrived in Kutaisi and took photo of the local Mac...
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256524983_3003faeb09_h.jpg"/>
<p>
...when the rain poured down.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256327461_83aaf79686_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Since the roads here are not at a high level, everything began to flow with terrible force, and my feet got wet.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257518469_9022c55ba7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
We barely managed to hide in the main attraction of Kutaisi - the Bagrati Temple (they are threatening to exclude it from the World Heritage list because Saakashvili restored it from ruins).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257074174_1e2e9988a7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It was getting dark, and after a look at the local architecture...
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256525018_af997967b8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
We set off on the final leg of the trip to Batumi.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256525098_cc0b741550_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Batumi</h2>
<p>
Mikheil Saakashvili wanted to make a European-level resort out of Batumi. After his departure, these Napoleonic plans were curtailed, but a lot had already been done, so we can safely say that Batumi became the most civilized place on the Black Sea coast of the USSR (probably, Sochi can now compete for this title, but I haven't been there). There are no resorts on the Black Sea in Turkey; there are resorts in Bulgaria and Romania, but I can’t say anything about them. In the city center it is like Europe.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256948570_1f2bf4f82a_h.jpg"/>

<p>
They made bike lanes.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255905431_6fd511a160_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Organized bike rental.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255905296_eb0229bbe6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
They built playgrounds, just like in Europe.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256948615_9a617a2fc1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Added modern futuristic architecture: wedding palace.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256654489_953bc37c0c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Tower with observation deck.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255176287_933b01d122_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The letters of the Georgian alphabet are written on the outside of the tower. For some reason the tower is closed, although it is completed.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257465934_d77bcbcee0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
They added a little Gaudi.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256719966_00c1d9cc75_h.jpg"/>
<p>
They put up sculptures.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256719916_3d1f1eba62_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In this composition, the figures are constantly moving closer and further away.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255905556_c3e8bb975f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
They added fire.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255176342_97ab168c52_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The palm trees are illuminated very beautifully.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256654604_715c47323d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Please note that there are tiles on the sidewalks, and in the center and on the road too.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256948785_19df47b408_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In general, Batumi is a rare example of a historical center that is almost not spoiled by the Soviet Union.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256719826_f3c373a694_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Where there is Soviet stuff, it is painted in bright colors.
<p/>

<p>
Note the stone face under the balcony.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256106973_a327a6ebdb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The mountains begin immediately behind Batumi.
<p/>

<p>
Probably the coolest McDonald's I've ever seen.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256107793_924606d114_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I wasn't even too lazy to take a photo of the inside.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256949335_25805618e1_h.jpg"/>

Learning to decipher dancing men: McDonald's name in Georgian is called.

<p>
Since we're talking about food, you can eat in Batumi for ridiculous money (although a little more expensive than the Georgian average).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255175877_449f404c1a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
For example, in this establishment.
<p/>

<p>
I really liked the Adjarian khachapuri. This one costs less than 150 rubles ($5), and the two of us could barely finish it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256107298_2372619f01_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The beach in Batumi is not very comfortable, with stones. We didn’t manage to swim for two days because the weather was bad.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255176437_5ce928003c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Batumi is more of a port city. On that day, an American warship came on a friendly visit, and visitors were allowed in according to a list.
<p/>

<p>
Street signs are very nice. Interesting - street named after Zviad Gamsakhurdia. There is more support for him in western Georgia.
<p/>

<p>
Here, too, the Chrome icon has become the symbol of the Internet cafe.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256106883_452dea44c0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A cable car was recently built in Batumi. The view from the top is not great because the hill is quite far from the city center and there is not much around.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255176692_ccc119c7a9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Well, maybe an interesting cross.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256107483_196e4bd0ed_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But riding a cable car is very interesting for the sake of the process itself, because the cabin passes over ordinary areas of the city, and it looks as if you are flying in a helicopter.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256107593_83939f13ce_h.jpg"/>
<p>
From here you can see the splendor and poverty of Batumi.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256948895_a40d3a19b2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A significant part of the city consists of private small houses.

If you walk around the center, looking into the courtyards, you can see a lot of things.

<p>
Until recently, Stepantsminda was called Kazbegi, and they still write that on minibuses. Although Mount Kazbek is located nearby, it has no relation to the old name of the city, which came from the name of a Georgian writer.

But there are a lot of tourists here, because this is the largest settlement on the Georgian military road, and probably the most accessible place in mountainous Georgia (it’s a long drive to Svaneti).

Literally a week after I passed through here, there was a mudflow, and the road was destroyed and closed for a couple of months, and three months later there was a mudflow twice as large.
