<i>23-24 August 2023</i>
<h2>Doha</h2>
<p>
I was in Qatar on a layover at the airport back in 2011 (on the way to <a href="../indonesia-1">Indonesia</a>), but never visited the country itself. Unlike <a href="../bahrain">Bahrain</a> and <a href="../uae2023">UAE</a>, low-cost airlines do not fly to Qatar; tickets from neighboring countries are absurdly expensive, and the cheapest way to get here is a long stopover with Qatar Airways. This airline is usually quite expensive, but for some destinations their tickets are, on the contrary, some of the cheapest, for example to Pakistan. I took the longest connection I could - 23 hours, and here I'm finally in Qatar.

<p>
Not long ago the FIFA World Cup took place in Qatar. Thanks to it public transport has been seriously improved. In 2019, subway was opened in Qatar, and it already has three lines.
<p/>

<p>
The subway is cheap - one trip is 2 rials ($0.60), unlimited rides for the whole day cost 6 rials (less than $2). In Dubai, one trip costs an average of $2. At the same time, the metro in Dubai is constantly crowded, while in Qatar it is quite free.

<p>
Another benefit of the championship is that a lot of hotels opened for it, and now accomodation is relatively cheap in Qatar: I got such a luxurious room for only $33.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53151014658_6418fde728_h.jpg"/>
<p>
As in any Muslim country, there was a Koran in the room, but here it was translated into English.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53150517361_eb3eb8d488_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The hotel area is literally one metro station from the city center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53150951375_6d94b4fd75_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Like Dubai, Doha has two centers - a historical one and a modern one with skyscrapers. The historical center is between Msheireb and Souq Waqif stations.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53150720914_fb9ed91cc5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The Msheireb metro area is a new business district, built just a few years ago. In terms of architecture, this place is very atypical for Arab countries - rather it resembles new areas somewhere in England or Australia are designed .
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53149940802_41d4f4a6e4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In fact, it's very similar to Australia in tone. The area is mostly pedestrian and there is a tram line (it doesn't seem to be running yet or runs infrequently).

<p>
Next comes the Waqif market, this is supposedly the oldest part of the city (well, the middle of the 20th century). This is an analogue of the old part of Dubai.
<p/>

<p>
Doha is similar to Dubai in many ways, but there are a lot fewer tourists and people in general. In Dubai, for example, Deira is crowded in the evening; it’s more spacious here for now.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53150720774_dd45c44008_h.jpg"/>
<p>
As far as I understand, there are much fewer options to move to Qatar compared to the UAE. The vacancies for construction and service workers from Pakistan/India are the same, but for businessmen, investors, freelancers and simply employees of international companies, there are much fewer jobs.

The cultural center seems to be shaped like the famous mosque in Iraq in the city of Samarra.

In the first half of the 20th century, pearl fishing was carried out in Qatar, as elsewhere in the Persian Gulf.

The toilet signs in Qatar are unusual. The man here also seems to be wearing a dress, he differs from the woman with color and the presence of a "wheel" on his head. And he swaddles children just like a woman.

Just like in the UAE, in Qatar you can easily find cuisine from any Asian country, which is awesome.

Let's see a little bit of Qatar outside the capital. I took the metro to the final stop to the north - the city of Lusail. This is a new city, founded in 2006, and it is now the second largest city in Qatar.

I took the bus and went further north. Outside the Doha metropolitan area it is mostly desert.
