<h1>Brazil: Curitiba, Ponta Grossa, Florianópolis, Porto Alegre</h1>
<i>31 December 2012 - 4 January 2013</i>
<h2>Curitiba</h2>
<p>
The south of Brazil begins from the state of Parana. There are no slums, few people sleep on the streets, low crime rates, low unemployment and high wages. Historically, settlers from Europe settled in the south of Brazil (unlike the north, where African slaves worked on plantations), so it has the most diverse ethnic composition. Curitiba has plazas and parks created by various diasporas, from Japan to Germany.

<p>
In the city center there is a large pedestrian street, just like in Europe.

<p>
The signature Brazilian tiles are complemented by flower beds.

<p>
Several shops were indeed open inside, but trade was not very brisk, since it was December 31st.

<p>
Curitiba's most famous feature is its cylindrical bus stops. The fare is paid at the stop, and buses travel in dedicated lanes. I have already observed a similar system in Jakarta.

<p>
Advertisements for prostitutes on pay phones here look like little business cards stuck into slots in the phone's casing.

<p>
As the evening approaches, most of the city falls silent, just like in northern Europe.

<p>
On New Year's Eve, people concentrated on one square - Espanha. As luck would have it, there is a fairly large block around this square, laid out on a rectangular grid, with a bunch of streets, and their names were not labeled on the map. As a result, I had to get lost a lot in the dark until I found the right place by sounds.
<p/>

<h2>Ponta Grossa</h2>
<p>
Brazil has very comfortable buses, including on short routes. This bus took two hours from Curitiba to Ponta Grossa, but there was a dry toilet, a container with drinking water, and comfortable footrests. On the morning of January 1st the bus was almost empty.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257401659_c06a95ae97_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The population of Ponta Grossa is 300 thousand people. By Brazilian standards, there is peace and quiet here, with no problems with work and decent salaries.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256655011_bcee49187a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Like Curitiba, there are many corners that remind you of different countries. Munich Avenue.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256655191_88323aa536_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And this building is, no less, a Mormon temple! In addition to the descendants of emigrants, there are also relatively many foreigners in Ponta Grossa - exchange students from a fairly reputable local university.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255926717_7530f6f791_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a bit of antiquity in the center.
<p/>

<p>
Pay attention to the benches and parking along the sidewalk.
<p/>

<p>
They still collect tithes there (I thought this was something from the history of the Middle Ages).

<p>
Sports center for people with disabilities. Can you imagine one like this somewhere in Ivanovo (the population is even larger than in Ponta Grossa)? It seems to me that it was at this moment that I was finally convinced that Russia still has to grow and grow to the level of development of Brazil.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256655176_c5198920e3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At each entrance there is a sign with the name and address of the security agency protecting the building. So that every thief knows that there is nothing to catch.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256655026_6ec9499f04_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Getting out of the car, Andre, who was showing me the city, pulled out the radio and took it home. I was very surprised. It turned out that if this is not done, there is a chance that some thief will break the window and steal the radio. The chance is very small, but nevertheless, out of habit, people always try to be on the alert.
<p/>
<h2>Florianópolis</h2>
<p>
Going to Florianópolis during the day was a mistake. If the distance is long, then you need to travel by bus <i>only</i> at night. You can get some sleep and the trip will go by unnoticed. During the day there are a lot of stops, driving in the city is not fast due to traffic jams and traffic lights, five hours gradually turns into six or seven, and there is nothing to do on the bus. Out of boredom, I tried to photograph the surrounding landscapes from the window. Suddenly, the Statue of Liberty stood outside the mall.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255370142_9d708b263f_h.jpg"/>

<p>
The landscape in the states of Paraná and Santa Catarina is pleasantly hilly and wooded.
<p/>

<p>
It just rained.

Shopping center "Paradise of Towels".
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256300168_376143979e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In Florianópolis, I miraculously managed to grab the last ticket to Porto Alegre, having repurchased the ticket that had just been handed over to the ticket office. The cover of the city map read "Welcome to Paradise!" Paradise is separated from the continent by a huge bridge.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255370257_ca6622713f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In addition to the city of Florianópolis (population more than half a million), on the island of the same name there are many resort towns that are famous for their beaches. Initially, I thought of going there too, but the weather was terrible, it was pouring rain every day, so I decided to skip to Porto Alegre, where no more rain was expected, stopping only in the city of Florianópolis proper. I didn’t regret at all that I made a stop here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255370297_5a59713cdc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The city is beautiful. Multi-colored small one-story houses are built between multi-story ones.
<p/>

<p>
Typical Florianópolis.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256300428_6dc4d23ba7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the evening, the streets are illuminated with beautiful lanterns.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256300583_ba2a09208a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The most beautiful thing is the houses on the hillside, like in Rio de Janeiro.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257143360_719d80d271_h.jpg"/>
<p>
These are also favelas, but quite old, with decent infrastructure and without much crime.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256100606_65681d6c27_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The favelas occupy the entire wide hill above the center.
<p/>

<p>
Those who live nearby fence themselves off with broken glass out of habit.

A breathtaking monument.

<p>
The house number is written in iron numbers hanging at different heights. A similar design is popular in Argentina.
<p/>

The symbol of the city is an old fig tree.

<p>
It was transplanted to this square in 1891, as the plaque tells in almost poetic form.

<h2>Porto Alegre</h2>
<p>
In Porto Alegre, I tried one of my favorite maneuvers: take the metro to the last stop and walk around the area. The Porto Alegre metro consists of one line. One of the terminal stations is located in the very center, and the second one is on the far outskirts. On the way back, I rode from one end to the other and was convinced that the metro here was not underground anywhere, except for the underground passage leading to the platform. The final stop is located in a satellite city with the romantic name New Hamburg (Novo Hamburgo), and the metro does not go to the actual center of this city with skyscrapers, although the line itself has already been built.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255849242_18b8719dca_h.jpg"/>

<p>
This area is mainly built up with small private houses.
<p/>

<p>
Normal roads have not yet been built everywhere here; at some point the asphalt runs out.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257324364_4acd9735e3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The area is not very suitable for walking; the sidewalk is essentially a path on the ground. The bins are designed for large packages. There are, however, restaurants here and there. There are also buses here, there are special tariffs: if you take the bus, transfer to the metro, and then take the bus again, the trip by metro will be virtually free.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257324339_cf767340fb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Even on this outskirts they accept cards in stores.

<p>
If you go towards the center, you will soon see apartment buildings.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257619450_7ba76fa64d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
As in Rio de Janeiro, every street sign here has an explanation of the name. Funny explanation: “Aratimbo is a word from an Indian language,” it doesn’t say which one, or what it means.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256777968_9a3a552a7e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The metro station is the most modern building in the area.

<p>
The state of Rio Grande do Sul has the second highest percentage of white population (after the neighboring state of Santa Catarina).
<p/>

<p>
However, it was in Porto Alegre that they tried to rob me the only time in South America. This happened because I went from the station to the hotel along the shortest path on the map, but it turned out to be a street where prostitutes hang out.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256657761_4e6003c2d3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Although I didn't lose anything, I was especially careful in Porto Alegre and didn't even go shopping after sunset.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257700615_763aeb9f49_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And when I left, I walked to the station making a long detour.

<p>
If you have well-developed peripheral vision, then while walking in Porto Alegre, you will definitely notice the name Toniolo. It is most often found on manhole covers and fences. Toniolo once worked for the local police, and in his free time he wrote columns for the local newspaper, not hesitating to scold everyone and everything. When he criticized the police chief, he was fired from his job, simultaneously diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, and then Toniolo decided to take revenge. Since then, he has written his name on all the fences, adding revolutionary slogans. Toniolo represents the non-existent "Anarchist Party of Brazil" and virtually runs anywhere, essentially personifying a candidate "against everyone." In Brazil, there is no such option on the ballot (there are no ballots themselves either; voting is completely electronic), and it is impossible to campaign to vote against everyone, which is why Toniolo is disliked by his former police colleagues, and, of course, he is persecuted for vandalism.

<p>
Porto Alegre is similar to Florianópolis in that the old houses are mixed with skyscrapers in the center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256657331_f48ed8f56d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are a great many people on the central streets.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256657356_9cf11eb413_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The houses are generally in good condition.
<p/>

<p/>

<p>
There are many buildings that look like palaces.

As in any self-respecting South American city, in the center there is a pompous central market.

And this is what this place looks like from above. A bunch of red cars is the taxi queue at the central bus station.
<p/>

For a short time, the state of Rio Grande do Sul was an independent state. There are still the strongest separatist sentiments here of all the southern states. Local nationalists are flying a flag of anarchist colors - red and black.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256657536_6936dff58b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Another interesting feature of Brazil is that they like to accurately refer to laws. For example, in Russia, many stores have notices that alcohol is not sold to minors. In Brazil, such signs will necessarily indicate the number of the law or regulation that says this. Here it is prohibited to sell animals, on the basis of some municipal decree. Apparently they tried it before.
