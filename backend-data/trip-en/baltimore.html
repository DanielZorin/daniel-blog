<h1>USA: Washington DC, Baltimore</h1>
<i>13-15 October 2021</i>
<h2>Washington DC</h2>
<p>
The trip to Central America began in the USA, for some reason cheap tickets to Belize were only available from Baltimore (despite the fact that there was still a transfer in Miami), so I took a direct flight from Moscow to Washington DC, where I was for the first time <a href="../washington">in 2013</a>.

<p>
On the plane they handed out a questionnaire with questions about whether I had recently been to Wuhan. I don’t know whether Aeroflot has accumulated questionnaires from two years ago, or whether someone else is not right in the head. Upon arrival, no one looked at the questionnaire or PCR tests.
<p/>

<p>
There are two airports in Washington DC, international flights mainly fly to the more distant Dulles, you need to take the bus, then the metro to the center. There is a Google office near the metro.

<p>
Then I rode the metro for another hour.

<p>
Arrived at Benning Road station.

<p>
Excellent area, they sell from the ground near the metro, just like in Brazil.

<p>
Now, instead of the names of presidential candidates, they put signs like these on lawns.
<p/>

<p>
I went to the local library.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51736579695_d3d67a64ec_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And I was vaccinated against coronavirus with the Janssen vaccine (which is a single dose) so that I could enter countries that do not accept Sputnik. In the USA, the vaccination document is paper without any QR code. There is also a database, but each state has its own. In Washington DC, only at the very end of 2021 they created a portal where you can get an electronic certificate, I was able to register on it and also get a QR code.
<p/>

<p>
The job is done, I can go back and check into an airbnb. Most metro stations are similar:
<p/>

<p>
There was still time, so I walked around the center around the Capitol, where famous events took place in January 2021.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51735692691_0eb61adaca_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There were no longer any special fences at the Capitol, but there were no tours due to the coronavirus.
<p/>

<p>
It’s funny that I came across a ticket sale on the metro; I’ve never seen a discount promotion on the metro anywhere.

<p>
Housing in Washington is kind of expensive, I had a hard time finding a place even in Arlington (it’s across the river in Virginia), the metro is still two kilometers away.
<p/>

<p>
The area is nice.

Many houses had Halloween decorations.

<p>
An abandoned house is an extremely rare sight in a city like Washington, where land and real estate are expensive.

<p>
I had the next day free to get over the side effects of the vaccine. I didn’t feel well, but I walked around the city center a little, fortunately the weather was good. Near the metro stood Flixbus, a friend from Europe, which now also goes to New York.
<p/>

<p>
First of all, I took a PCR test for the flight to Belize. Passing the test in the USA is a huge problem if you are a tourist. Almost all hospitals accept only patients with local insurance or require an SSN number. There are no laboratories like Invitro in Russia, where you can enter from the street and get a test. Only at some airports it is possible to take the test, and it is very expensive (100-150 dollars). There were several other points in Washington where you could take the test right on the street for free, including in this square in the center. This is a salvation (although I had to wait almost two days for the result), but it is not a fact that this exists in other cities.

The White House was just nearby.
<p/>

<p>
The number of fences around it seems to have increased noticeably.

<p/>

<p>
The flight was from Baltimore airport, which is a different city, but if you look for flights to/from Washington, the Baltimore airport will be suggested too (similar to Beauvais airport for Paris). For the first time I traveled in the USA on an intercity train (although it is more of a suburban train that runs on the Washington - Baltimore route).

<h2>Baltimore</h2>
<p>
Baltimore is the largest city in Maryland, about an hour's drive from Washington DC. This is a large port city, which consistently ranks among the top cities in terms of crime rates (in 2019, it was in 11th place in the world for murders and second in the USA after <a href="../st-louis">St. Louis</a>).

There is a long main street from the station to the harbor.
<p/>

There are old houses here, like in Boston or other cities on the Atlantic coast.

This is the central square of the historical part of the city, but now it is not a particularly important area, all life is near the harbor to the south.

And also by metro, of which there is only one line. The last subway in the USA that I have never ridden before.
