<h1>Philippines: Cagayan de Oro, Camiguin, Dumaguete, Cebu, Bohol, Puerto Princesa</h1>

<h2>Cagayan de Oro</h2>
<p>
There is such a popular pastime in the Philippines as cockfighting. In any more or less large city you can see it if you are there on a weekend.
<p/>

<p>
Finding an arena can be difficult. They are called cockpit (yes, like the cabin of a ship). In the city of Cagayan de Oro, the arena is located quite far from the center, and not everyone knows where it is, but in the end the necessary jeepney was found. Officially it is called “Gusa Sports Complex”, but in reality there are only cockfights there.
<p/>

<p>
Entrance. There is a fee to attend the fights, 100 pesos. You can buy a ticket for the far grandstand, but it is only slightly cheaper.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256728789_0684bf192e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Inside, the arena looks like a boxing ring behind a glass fence with plastic chairs placed around it.
<p/>

<p>
Participating with your rooster is also not free; you need to pay a tournament fee, from which the prize fund is made.
<p/>

<p>
I didn't fully understand the rules. Here is the standings. It shows that most roosters fight once, but some winners then fight among themselves too.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255979046_45e64bed5e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A special long sharp spur is put on the rooster's leg, so the fight goes on until the death or serious injury of one of the participants.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257022805_960afb4e26_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Before the fight, the roosters are teased.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256179908_47868fac06_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And then the battle begins.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257023105_722b3175a1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Before this, there is still a betting session. It looks like this: there is a roar in the hall, the spectators, mostly in the far stands, are shouting something and pointing their fingers at their bets. A special person remembers them.
<p/>

A fight rarely lasts more than a minute.
<p/>

<p>
But sometimes the roosters begin to ignore each other, then they are pitted against each other again.

<p>
A cruel and senseless spectacle. Essentially, it’s a random game - whoever is the first to accidentally wave his paw with a razor is fatal.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256728419_c0e57378e4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The winner is raised by the judge, just like a hand with a glove is raised in boxing.

<p>
Cagayan de Oro is a major city on the island of Mindanao, the second largest island in the Philippines. It is interesting primarily as the closest major airport to Camiguin Island. Mindanao is considered an unsafe place to travel because there are Islamist rebels in the south who want to secede from the Philippines and make their own state with Sharia and Gurias. There is even a special autonomy in southern Mindanao. But all this does not apply to Cagayan, it is on the northern coast of the island, and it is not dangerous there.

<p>
It's just as gloomy and gray as the rest of the Philippines, but it's inexpensive.

The whole essence of the Philippines is a modern shopping center in an old shabby gray concrete building that looks like a prison.
<p/>

Easy to find something like this:

Local public transport is called motorela. A cross between a jeepney and a tuk-tuk.
<p/>

A local politician calls for a “march of millions” against the sale of their homeland to the Chinese and Malays.

The ferry service to Camiguin Island is a two-hour drive from Cagayan de Oro. To get there, you need to overcome four levels of control. First they sell you a ticket. Then, after 10 meters, a fee for using the port is paid separately - some ridiculous amount like 5 pesos. The ticket attendant attaches a small coupon to the ticket with a paper clip. Further, after 50 meters, two people sit at the entrance to the waiting room and tear off this coupon, leaving only the ticket. Finally, when the ferry arrives, they let you in, checking your ticket (but not taking it). This is how you increase the GDP! The fee for using the port clearly only results in losses, because more money will be spent on a coupon, paper clips and paying three people. But this money increases the GDP of the Philippines.

<h2>Camiguin</h2>
<p>
The small island of Camiguin is a real pearl of the Philippines. It’s relatively civilized here, lots of beauty, gorgeous beaches, inexpensive, good internet. There are very few tourists, because the place is not particularly popular.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256191048_d8300e664d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Getting to Camiguin is no more difficult than getting to Boracay. There is an airport on the island itself, but there is only one flight a day from Cebu, very early in the morning. The airport looks like this:
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256740749_4714ee6f5c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Inside, baggage inspection is done with bare hands. They didn’t like the chopsticks in my carry on, but fortunately I could put them into my checked luggage, since it’s in the same room. Also, due to the strong wind, they had to take fewer passengers, and everyone was offered an alternative flight through Cagayan, but I was lucky to avoid that. Yes, there are many more flights to Cagayan de Oro; it takes an hour by ferry and two to three hours by bus.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256192508_1c443d4e71_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are also ferries from Bohol, a three-hour journey.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255262062_6f0021537c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Another advantage of Camiguin is that you can travel around it on public transport for about 5 dollars, which is what I did on the first day. In a circle it turns out to be about 60 kilometers. The starting point is the town of Mambajao, the capital. There is even an observation deck in the capital, not far from the airport runway.

<p>
There is a bakery in town that sells buns for 2 pesos. I can tell you that there is a queue there for a reason.
<p/>

The restaurants here are simply called eateries.

<p>
There is also a black sand beach, so-so. Camiguin is an island with an active volcano.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255989996_1f7cc3ee79_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It is the most difficult to leave Mambajao, because motorized vehicles (tuk-tuks with two benches) only take you to the edge of the city, and from the edge to the next city there are still 10 kilometers if you go counterclockwise. There are also jeepneys on the road, but somewhat less often than tuk-tuks. So I walked about three kilometers along a deserted highway.

Welcome to Camiguin - the island without rabies. Thank you!
<p/>

<p>
There is an “underwater cemetery” here - it went under water as a result of a volcanic eruption in the 19th century. As far as I understand, apart from the cross, you won’t find much underwater without scuba gear, although you can look at the fish.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256191183_ad82badb8f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Nearby there is a path up, along which there are statues dedicated to the Way of the Cross.

<p>
I thought about trying to climb up the volcano itself, but abandoned this idea after seeing the path. These are not steps, it is difficult to climb.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256739504_0989c5b602_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Then I waited for the jeepney and got to the second city on the island - Catarman.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256191388_f82bb099ca_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On that part of the island there are Catarman, Sagay and Ginsiliban near each other, and tuk tuks often go between them. The shore is rocky everywhere.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255260817_542c9d37c4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a local public services center in Catarman with several windows.
<p/>

<p>
There is a fight against corruption and bureaucracy.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257033955_a662485492_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are even street signs here.
<p/>

<p>

There are also street signs here, and new ones at that.

<p>
It is said that there are a few buildings left from colonial times in Camiguin. Apparently, here they are.
<p/>

<p>
Schools everywhere are reputable.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255990751_0efd8c0201_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At the same time, locals often live in such huts.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255989871_c10fb09ba1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Ginsiliban - a smoke-free city! It’s also good for business, for children, for health, and accounting is also well done here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257034220_d8ecc6458d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And this is not a joke - here in the village the entire budget of the district is actually posted on the notice board.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257034320_a8deb44d98_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Without any irony, I take my hat off to such openness of the local authorities.

<p>
On that day they celebrated the city day (Foundation day). All schools had rulers.
<p/>

Village.

<p>
And here’s the answer to why they don’t smoke here. If I walked past such a poster every day, I definitely would not smoke.
<p/>

This village is home to another attraction - a giant clam farm.

<p>
Tridacna, the largest mollusk in the world, is grown here. First in the pool, then released into the sea.

From the south of Camiguin you can see the mountains on the neighboring island of Mindanao.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256739784_d92f17aee8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I didn’t wait for the jeepney at the tridacnus farm, but for 100 pesos I rode the remaining 20 kilometers to Mambajao by motorcycle taxi.
<p/>

<p>
The second day on Camiguin began in the town of Mahinog - the only one that I had passed through without stopping the day before. There is a tall waterfall here, one of two on the island.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257034520_056ed76394_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Below the waterfall you can swim in the clearest water.
<p/>

<p>
I saw jackfruit growing for the first time. Such a twenty-kilogram colossus on a branch.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256740149_f87386eed7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But the coolest thing on Camiguin is the small island of Mantigue, ten kilometers from the coast. If you want to see Bounty ads in real life, this is probably the closest you can get.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255261532_53288bb063_h.jpg"/>
<p>
To get there, you need to charter a boat for 550 pesos.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256191953_a8bc6a26d8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And that's pretty much it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256740639_987bbe00cb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is a real island paradise.

There is no complete privacy here either - in the center of the island there are several fishing huts.

<p>
Another part of the coastal waters is fenced off, they feed fish there, and they ask for money for snorkeling with mask/goggles, however, when I got there, almost everyone had already left and didn’t take any money.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256192068_85ddf8a6a1_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256740329_dad093c8cd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
However, you can also snorkel near the shore. Good catch:
<p/>

I've never found a starfish myself before.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255261822_a7e7ca21f7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But outside the fenced area there are almost no fish, only starfish and sea urchins, which you need to try not to run into.
<p/>

<h2>Dumaguete</h2>
<p>
Dumaguete on the island of Negros is the most pleasant of the Philippine cities. On the one hand, this is a city with all the infrastructure. Moreover, there is even a semblance of an embankment, and without a mountain of garbage.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255345817_2301ec9bc4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The city is quite gloomy, but at least there are no hellish traffic jams here, like in Cebu.

The trip around the area was unsuccessful. As soon as we reached the town of Valencia, it started to rain. The town has a very detailed table of tariffs for motorcycles (they are called habal-habal).

What is useful about staying in the city is that you can eat fruit. The Philippines is full of fruits, but the resorts only offer bananas, occasionally small mangoes... and that's it. It is not clear why it is so sad, but a variety of fruits can only be obtained in large cities. Here in Dumaguete, we bought avocados, mangoes, avocado limes, soursop, santol and marang at the market. Santol is not bad, but small. Soursop is tasteless. Marang is a jackfruit with the taste of paper, and if you peel it yourself, you will spend a long time washing your hands and knife from sticky dirt.

<h2>Cebu</h2>
<p>
Cebu is a terrible place with a large airport. This city simply has no advantages. This is the quintessence of dullness and depression.

I have surprisingly few photographs of this place left, and not a single one from the night time. All evening I tried to get the phone to pick up the network (this is in the center of one of the largest cities in the country). As a result, the 3G Internet never worked, but it turned out to be working in the lobby of my hotel, a hangout for sex tourists. I sat on a chair with a laptop in the company of giant cockroaches and watched middle-aged men with prostitutes pass by.

Suddenly, Cebu has grown to the point where jeepneys have route numbers.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257041875_f946b8c7a5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But they didn’t get to the point of making public transport at the airport. Yes, it is the second largest airport in the country, and quite nice inside, but transport to it is very non-trivial. Upon arrival at 7 am, I took a taxi, in which I slept until 9, stuck in traffic. The airport is located on the island of Mactan, which has two bridges, and both are always standing, and both lead onto the only large road through the entire city, which is also always standing. It also takes an hour and a half to leave Cebu by bus.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255269187_ef769e0905_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Wikitravel reports that you can take a jeepney with a transfer to the area beyond the bridge, and change again there. Very encouraging. In fact, here is the cheapest way to get to the airport (and faster than taking a taxi). From the airport there are mini-jeepneys ("multicabs") to a shopping center a couple of kilometers away, which is located on the main highway of the island. There you can change to a multicab going southwest. There are traffic jams, but not always, you can ride with a breeze. There you need to get off next to the ferry terminal, take the ferry, and in 20 minutes you will be in the very center of Cebu, bypassing all the traffic jams and spending less than a dollar on travel.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257042180_2a7531f878_h.jpg"/>
<p>
As usual in the Philippines, a ferry ticket costs 11 pesos, and another 1 (!) peso is the port tax, which must be paid at a separate window.

For 500 pesos ($11) you can watch it while sitting on a boat, but it’s completely worthless. But with a mask for 1000 pesos - that’s the thing. Not very cheap, but in other countries it will be much more expensive, but the entertainment is definitely worth it.

There are few boats because the action is coming to an end. Sharks are fed only in the morning. Previously, it was full of boats and at least a dozen sharks, it was impossible to miss.

<h2>Bohol</h2>
<p>
Instead of staying in the magical city of Cebu, why not go to the neighboring island of Bohol? Having already had extensive experience traveling around the Philippines, I was quite skeptical, not hoping that the trip would be quick and easy. But everything didn't go so badly. For the first time in the Philippines, I got on a normal ferry, like in all other countries, and I didn’t get motion sickness.

It is naive to hope that something will be on schedule; it is better to approach the issue philosophically and arrive early. Try to understand something in this schedule, which also changes every week.

In one day it is possible to get to the main attraction of Bohol - the chocolate hills. They are located five kilometers from the city of Carmen in the center of the island, and Carmen is located 40 km from the port of Tubigon - a huge distance for the Philippines.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256684419_4d17f60f81_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Of course, covering these 40 kilometers takes about two hours.
<p/>

I thought about going back by minibus. While we were waiting for it to fill, a bus arrived and the driver was left with nothing. In the God's country it is not recommended to drive faster than 15 kilometers per hour.

Entry there costs something like 50 pesos ($1). It's funny that the tickets come in the form of stamps that say "5 pesos." Accordingly, instead of two tickets you get a whole sheet of these stamps.

<h2>Palawan</h2>
<p>
The underground river on the island of Palawan is the most famous landmark of the Philippines and one of the seven wonders of nature. Access there, by Philippine standards, is even well organized, if you do everything according to the instructions, fortunately everything is written on the Internet. The easiest way is to take a guided tour for about 1,100 pesos ($25). Then you don’t have to think about anything, but there are disadvantages: a very early rise at five in the morning, a difficult road there and back. You can spend the night near the park on your own, save $7, and enjoy the sea and the beach instead of the slums and exhaust fumes in Puerto Princesa.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257712105_f25f6414ed_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The easiest way to fly into the island of Palawan is through the airport in Puerto Princesa - in fact, the only city on the island. In the city you need to go to the national park office, which is located on the ground floor of the local stadium. There, using your passport, they will issue a “permit” to visit the national park, it costs 250 pesos. The permit looks serious, an A4 paper. Then you can go straight to the bus station, from where minibuses run several times a day to the village of Sabang for 200 pesos. There are also cheaper once-a-day jeepneys if you like having your ass abused and bounced around on potholes for three hours. Arriving in Sabang, you can check into a hotel. A fairly decent-looking room (though without air conditioning) costs $10. Electricity in the village is only available from 6 pm to 6 am, so run to the beach.
<p/>

The beach is gorgeous - wide, sandy, heavenly, completely empty.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257416494_fef77232b7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are also mountains around! It is quite possible to relax here regardless of the river.

<p>
And these are all the boats that take you to the river in the morning, which is still a few kilometers away.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256669636_53839be8d6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the morning you need to show your permit at the ticket office, pay another 45 pesos village tax and take a boat to the river. In principle, you can walk to the river in an hour, but they say that you need to hire a guide for 200 pesos per person, so there is no financial sense in this. The boat at the marina costs 700 pesos and can accommodate up to 6 people. 99% come in organized groups, there are few independent ones (so after lunch the village is empty), but even if you find two fellow travelers, the price will become normal (in total it’s cheaper than an excursion).

It is possible to take photographs in the cave, but it is not very convenient, because there is virtually no lighting, except for one flashlight in each boat, plus the boat is moving, which makes it difficult to focus. Well, I tried to shoot a little.
