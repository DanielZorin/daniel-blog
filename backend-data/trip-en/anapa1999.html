<h1>Russia: Anapa</h1>
<i>June 1999</i>
<p>
My first time at the sea was in Anapa. Mom bought a ticket to a cheap hotel in the suburbs of Anapa called Dzhemete. The conditions there were so-so, similar to those in cheap hostels in Indonesia. After the end of the trip, we moved nearby, renting a room from local residents - this business is thriving in resort towns. As I understand it, it turned out to be cheaper, so in subsequent years we always rented apartments on site, without using official hotels and sanatoriums.
