<h1>Bangladesh: Dhaka</h1>
<i>28-31 May, 4-8 June 2017</i>
<h2>Dhaka</h2>
<p>
Bangladesh is not a place where people go for beautiful views and ancient temples. This is a country where you can look at life as it was 50 years ago, in conditions of overpopulation. After the fact, I can say that neighboring <a href="http://goo.gl/zCHzej">Myanmar</a> is even better suited for this purpose - it is both more backward and dirtier, only the crowds there are a little smaller. Since crowds are the main feature of Bangladesh, let's start with them.

<p>
Dhaka Airport is located within the city, although far from the center (20 kilometers). The square in front of the airport is empty and beautiful, from there you can take a taxi, which will take you about three hours to the center. Just beyond the square there will be a wide street along which numerous buses, and immediately behind it there will be railway tracks and a station from which you can go directly to the main station in about 20 minutes.

Though, I still had to wait for some time, missing a couple of trains, since I did not want to ride on the roof.

Finally, a nicer train arrived, with soft chairs and empty seats.

<p>
And here I am at the station. I checked into a hotel opposite, a room with air conditioning cost almost 20 dollars - Bangladesh is not a particularly cheap country compared to Thailand. There are hotels for 5 dollars, but the conditions there will be bad.

<p>
How to get around Dhaka? Public transport is provided here by buses. The fare is very cheap (no more than $0.20), but the system is in complete anarchy: the buses don’t even have numbers, only directions. You can only drive at random on big streets.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256056176_87fa0d4a83_o.jpg">
<p>
Some of the buses in Dhaka are double-deckers, local ones, and not decommissioned from England.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256804244_d887b1a4ec_o.jpg">
<p>
All the buses have terribly damaged bumpers and sides, because they constantly rub in traffic jams.
<p/>

<p>
Traffic jams in Dhaka are severe even despite the low level of car ownership.

You can get around Dhaka by taxi. On the streets you can see rickshaws/tuk-tuks, which are called CNG here - from the abbreviation Compressed Natural Gas. The drivers of these CNGs are greedy - they refuse to go according to the meter, they demand an amount five times more than it would be according to the meter and do not bargain at all. So it really makes sense to choose from two other options: Uber taxi or pedicabs. Uber is nominally more expensive than CNG, but for a tourist it will actually be cheaper than the inflated off-meter price. The downside is that this is a car, which means travel time will increase greatly - you will have to stand in traffic jams that cannot be avoided on small streets.
<p/>

<p>
The best option seems to be a bicycle taxi - there you don’t even have to bargain too much, the price is already normal. Not bad for short distances within the city center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256257923_fa125ff44e_o.jpg">
<p>
Pedicabs make up a very significant share of traffic in the city center.

Food in Bangladesh is bad. Bangladeshis do not eat in restaurants; there are vanishingly few catering establishments, and even fewer that are not repulsive. The cheap menus are only in Bengali, so you have to choose at random. The choice is modest, the quality of food is low. For example, in Bangladesh I saw the skinniest chickens in the world - I have never seen such bony pieces. The prices are not particularly low - for the same money in Thailand you can eat much better. This chicken with rice costs around 100 taka.
<p/>

<p>
On the other hand, the upper bar is quite low: in Dhaka I went to a very pretentious restaurant on the roof of a tall building to photograph the panorama, and dishes cost around 5 dollars. On the occasion of Ramadan, during the day they only gave a special combo menu for the same 5 dollars; in a regular canteen this would cost 2.5 dollars.
<p/>

Fast food chains in Dhaka include KFC and Burger King.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256257033_20ac066748_o.jpg">
<p>
In principle, you can eat at KFC; a combo of chicken   potatoes   cola costs 180 taka, however, the cola in such a combo is about 100 milliliters in volume (I'm not kidding!).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256257133_651868abfc_o.jpg">
<p>
For 210 taka, the cola will reach its maximum size - it looks like 400 milliliters.

Dhaka has a completely unique noir atmosphere. If in neighboring <a href="../calcutta">Calcutta</a> jungles and slums swallow up palaces of the Victorian era, then in Dhaka in the middle of the city there are skyscrapers from the 70s - 80s, and somewhere new ones are being built in the same style. There is a lot of soot and dirt around, narrow alleys, damaged buses - here you want to make a movie about dark times.

I thought Dhaka would have a lot of luscious slums, but in reality there are no more than in India. There are traditional tent cities along the railway, and in the city there are no large areas like <a href="../mumbai">Dharavi</a>. The most slum place I saw was the Koila Ghat area on the banks of the river, not far from the center.
