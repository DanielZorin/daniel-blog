<h1>Turkey: Korkuteli, Acipayam, Afrodosias, Pamukkale, Çardak, Salda, Tefenni</h1>
<i>3-5 July 2022</i>
<h2>Korkuteli</h2>
<p>
The first trip around Turkey in a rented car was in the direction northwest of Antalya. The road immediately climbs into the mountains.

<p>
The roads are good everywhere and driving is quite easy. I haven’t visited any major cities, so I don’t know what the parking situation is like.
<p/>

<p>
It looks like America here.

<p>
The first city on the way is called Korkuteli (population 18 thousand). This is one of the regional centers of Antalya province. There are mushrooms at the entrance, apparently they are grown here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52209553398_88cd09511d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At the other entrance there are apples, pears and cherries.

<p>
In the central square, of course, there is a monument to Ataturk.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52209532376_1686f2964e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Nearby in the middle of the square is a lonely house, apparently a preserved historical monument.

After leaving there are some more mountains and then flatter landscape.

<h2>Acipayam</h2>
<p>
Shortly after Korkuteli, Antalya province ends, the route crosses the corner of Burdur province and goes into the province of <a href="../izmir">Denizli</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52209818714_087e3a77e6_h.jpg"/>

<p>
In the corner of Burdur province there is the village of Söğüt, where there is a fork, you can go further west to <a href="../fethiye">Fethiye</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52209819024_18c5649b6d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
When you come from the highway, most of the time you drive through vegetable gardens.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52209549561_fa5e01034a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This village is so small that there is no monument to Ataturk! At least in the central square (probably the school has a bust, as usual)
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52210034220_c98b835b01_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Instead there is a Christmas tree.

<p>
The small Turkish towns along the highway sometimes really resemble American ones, with all those huge signs for shops and restaurants along the wide highway that runs through the city. The city of Serinhisar advertises fried chickpeas (Leblebi).
<p/>

<h2>Afrodisias</h2>
<p>
Instead of going to Denizli, I turned southwest towards the small town of Tavas. Here is probably the most unusual monument to Ataturk that I have seen - here he dances the Lezginka (more precisely, the local dance Tavas Zeybegi).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52210033325_203654b265_h.jpg"/>

<p>
Behind, as usual, stands the second Ataturk.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52209570313_f5cbc5cf88_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Turning from Tavas onto a country road, after some time I crossed the border of Aydin province. In Turkey, at the borders of provinces there are at most small blue signs, and not huge steles, as happens in some countries.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52208541117_c23b6aa1e7_h.jpg"/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52209817814_7476d48482_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here are the ruins of the ancient city of Aphrodisias - one of the least known and difficult to access World Heritage Sites in Turkey. It seems that you can get here by minibus Tavas-Nazilli, but how often they run is unclear (I didn’t see one on the way).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52208541047_5faaeee6dc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Sarcophagi were made in this city, and now many of them are on display here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52210033035_d6cd49b728_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In general, I have been to many ancient Greek and Roman cities, but here there are especially many sculptures and bas-reliefs on display. Perhaps they are better preserved due to the city’s distance from civilization.

After Aphrodisias, I drove the car myself and didn’t take any photographs, I only stopped once to photograph this lake that formed near the Karacasu dam.

I took the country roads bypassing Denizli to Pamukkale.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52208540437_e58b6a6217_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Pamukkale</h2>
<p>
I was already in Pamukkale just six months ago in winter, now I saw this beautiful place in summer.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52210010820_00b4526468_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Since I had a car, I stayed at a hotel in the neighboring town of Karahayıt, a couple of kilometers north of the far entrance to Pamukkale. A room at the height of the summer season cost just over 10 euros. The town is very lively, it seems that tourists who come for a two-day excursion often settle here.
<p/>

<p/>

My hotel had its own swimming pool with hot mineral water.

<p>
In six months, entrance to Pamukkale has doubled in price - from 120 liras to 250! The lira also fell by half. It’s good that I have free entry with a museum membership, so I went twice - at sunset and at dawn.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52209794904_1866762cf2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In summer, travertines look more dazzling white.

<p/>

<p>
The disadvantage of summer is obvious - there are a lot of people, even before closing. I was hoping that tour groups arrive mostly during the day (for a one-day excursion) in order to have time to return before evening. Maybe there are even more people here during the day, I don’t know.

<h2>Çardak</h2>
<p>
After leaving Pamukkale, at first there is nothing particularly interesting; a major highway goes towards Ankara. I turned off from it in the city of Çardak, where Denizli airport is located (almost 50 kilometers from the city). In the central square there is an object of modern art.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52210031320_82a3c1ecc9_h.jpg"/>

<p>
Looking at the map, I would not have guessed that the city center is a narrow strip of development to the south of the highway, and not a wide one to the north.

Lavender fields look something like this.

<p>
Unexpectedly, a group of Turkish tourists were brought here by bus, although this place is very far from the main roads. Russian tourists are usually brought closer to Lake Salda, on the way to Pamukkale.

This was the worst section of the road, right between small villages.

Another lavender field, there are no tourists and no stall.

The next goal is Lake Salda.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52209545336_a885bccd6e_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Salda</h2>
<p>
Lake Salda is called “Turkish Maldives” in advertising brochures (this is also the name of Suluada Island near Kemer, where I have not yet visited). All thanks to the white beach and blue water, although it is not the same sand as in <a href="../maldives">Maldives</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52210009415_148221b980_h.jpg"/>

<p>
The nearest town is called Yeşilova.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52209793374_546e1ce37a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is a respectable city, here Ataturk is on horseback.

<p>
Driving along the shore of the lake, I discovered a small lavender garden. Everything here is made convenient for tourists so that they can take photographs, and it is more photogenic, since the bushes are planted more densely.
<p/>

If you lower the camera, it seems like a sea of ​​lavender.

<p>
A kilometer from the southern shore of Lake Salda there is a town of the same name, where I stayed for the night for less than 200 liras - very cheap. It’s interesting that on booking.com there is not a single hotel in this entire region, although the town is half made up of hotels. I mastered the local website otelz.com.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52209524171_c93c283cc2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The town is modest.

<p>
Lake Salda. As I understand it, excursions are brought here, however, it turned out that the entrance by car is from the other side, and swimming here is still prohibited, so I took a photo and drove further along the narrow road around the lake.

About 5 kilometers later is the next beach.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52209546058_55cf08cdd4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The lake is volcanic, the color here reminded me of a lake in <a href="../sulawesi">Indonesia</a>.

<h2>Tefenni</h2>
<p>
The last stage of the journey was returning home, so as not to have to go back the same way, I turned onto an older highway.

The next city is called Tefenni. In Turkey, the population of the city is often indicated at the entrance.

From Tefenni to the already familiar city of Korkuteli there are no towns, but the road passes through beautiful gorges.
