<h2>Kemer</h2>
<p>
In anticipation of the onset of winter in Kemer, I bought a couple of heaters and prepared for the constant rain. But as you know, the winter of 2022/2023 turned out to be very warm, and in fact, only one week in January was downright cold and rainy.

Before winter there was still a beautiful, warm autumn, when pomegranates and oranges ripened.

No one picked the pomegranates in the garden of my house, and they were so overripe that they even cracked.
