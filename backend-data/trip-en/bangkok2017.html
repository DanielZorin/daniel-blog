<h1>Thailand: Sungai Kolok, Bangkok</h1>
<i>21-27 June 2017</i>
<h2>Sungai Kolok</h2>
<p>
I have already been to this city; but last time my acquaintance was limited to the border terminal.

<p>
Just on the road from the border there is a poster “The police are looking for them.”

Graffiti as a sign of Thai-Malay friendship. This is the same “terrorist region” with increased security measures.

At the entrance to the station there is a whole checkpoint with x-rays. By that time, several months had passed since the death of King Rama IX, who had ruled Thailand since 1945. Over 70  years, countless portraits of him have been created, now their backgrounds or frames have been changed to black.

The street sign is not particularly prominent, just like the town itself.

From here you can get to Bangkok by direct train in one night (17 hours on the way). Previously, in Thailand I traveled only in the cheapest third-class carriages, where travel is almost free. This is what a second-class carriage looks like, there are air conditioners, and the seats are laid out in beds, like in Russia and China, but the layout of the carriage is different: here, it’s like all the seats are on the side. During the day there are two places opposite each other, at night you can lower the shelf on top.

All seats are covered with curtains, this is what the carriage looks like at night.

Travel to Bangkok costs about 800 baht ($27), which is cheaper than by plane and bus.

<h2>Bangkok</h2>
<p>
I had less than a week in Bangkok, and I didn’t really have time to see anything new, although I wanted to go to some of the suburbs. But I walked around in a new circle to many familiar places in the city center.
<p/>

<p>
I have been to this temple many times because it is closest to Khao San Road.
<p/>

Nothing seems to have changed on Khao San Road, except that my favorite hotel, the sign of which is visible in the photo, has risen in price by 50 baht.

It seems that the music has become a little quieter, at least my ears stopped hurting from it.

Of course, I went to buy sushi for 5-7 baht (I described this place in detail <a href="../bangkok">last time</a>)

It was out of season for durians, but at this corner market across the river they were still selling for 130.

Thai 7-11 now has the most delicious cheese noodles from South Korea! It costs more - 55 baht. By the way, later I managed to get these noodles in St. Petersburg and Moscow.

I wanted to go to the Temple of the Dawn, but in two years its restoration has not moved forward. We'll have to wait a couple more years.

I looked into the City Pillar shrine - there is such a temple in any city, but in Bangkok the altar is the largest.

The entire field next to the royal palace was occupied by temporary buildings made to bid farewell to King Rama IX.

It was not possible to visit the altar with wooden dicks - the passage to the courtyard was closed.
