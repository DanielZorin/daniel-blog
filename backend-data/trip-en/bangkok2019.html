<h1>Thailand: Bangkok</h1>
<i>10-17 March 2019</i>
<h2>Bangkok</h2>
<p>
After a two-year pause, the next trip to Asia begins with <a href="../bangkok">Bangkok</a> - the most convenient place of arrival in the region from Russia. I decided to just hang out in the city for a week, not go anywhere far, because why - everything you need is in Bangkok.
<p/>

<p>
What has changed since I was gone? Firstly, prices have increased slightly. In the hotel on Khao San, where I always stayed, the room cost was no longer 400, as in 2015, and not 500, as in 2017, but 600 baht, despite the fact that they had not changed qualitatively, except for the reception façade and the sign.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256084303_98353a309f_o.jpg">
<p>
So the next day I moved to a good hotel for 400 baht a little further from Khao San, at the same time it was not so noisy, but it took about 5 minutes to walk to get food.
<p/>

<p>
The street itself didn’t change much, either day or night.

Navigation around Bangkok has improved - now there are informative signs at bus stops indicating routes.
<p/>

Validators and wallet cards appeared on the buses themselves, as in many other large cities. Payment in cash to the conductor, however, also remained.
<p/>

Display screens and stop announcements in English also appeared.

The Siam Exchange, with a very good rate and a spread of much less than 1%, is thriving - instead of the old desk there is now a shiny, updated office with a new sign.
<p/>

<p>
New banknotes were printed with a portrait of the new king, they circulate parallel to the old ones. The share of new bills is highest among 20 and 50 baht bills - they are likely to wear out faster than large ones.

The restoration of Wat Arun, which has been going on since at least 2015, has finally finished.

I was surprised to see Portuguese Pastel de Nata cakes at the market. The taste was a little different. It turned out that the Chinese borrowed this sweet from the Portuguese from <a href="../macau2019">Macau</a>, and now it is popular in Guangdong in this variation.

Once I tried to take a shortcut through an expensive hotel, there was a dead end, and a mini-path for pedestrians looked rather funny, obviously no one used it, especially the hotel guests.

One day I went to explore the northern suburbs of Bangkok, formally belonging to the neighboring small province of Nonthaburi, which includes the city of the same name. Nonthaburi can be reached by boat along the Chao Phraya River - this is the final stop of the cheap public route.

This is where the Bangkok metro line runs. How many times have I been to this city, but I haven’t taken the metro - only the BTS (although the BTS is essentially also a metro, albeit an elevated one, the systems are formally separate). The Bangkok Metro (MRT) consists of two lines - blue and purple. Here is the purple one, opened in 2016.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256927705_5351081d0f_o.jpg">
<p>
This line is completely overhead, so in essence it is no different from the BTS. The main blue line is underground. Later, the blue line was closed into a ring, and at that time the end of the blue line was a transfer to the first stop of the purple line.
