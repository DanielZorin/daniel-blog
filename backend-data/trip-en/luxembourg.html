<h1>Luxembourg</h1>
<i>27 June 2012</i>
<p>
Luxembourg is usually called a microstate and is placed on a par with San Marino, Andorra, Liechtenstein and the Vatican. This is not entirely correct, since unlike other countries it is difficult to cross Luxembourg on foot in a day, as it is at least 50 kilometers from side to side.

Luxembourg has three official languages, but in the capital you feel like you are in a Francophone country. I had to suddenly adapt to the fact that the bus drivers spoke French.

Strange sculpture. What could it be?

The small town center is on a hill.

The central square has been turned into a market with flowers and vegetables.

The main attraction of the city is the dungeon fortress. You can walk through the tunnels to the  bottom of the hill, observing the surrounding beauty from the windows.

Entry is surprisingly cheap for Europe, only about three euros.

Outside the center, Luxembourg looks like a Belgian city, just much cleaner.

A dedicated bus lane in such a small town.

Bus station board. There are actually no buses to Belgium from here, except shuttles to Charleroi, where Ryanair airport is located. For buses you need to buy tickets in advance online. The easiest way to leave Luxembourg towards Belgium is by train to the border town of Arlon. You will have to fork out as much as 10 euros for a 15-minute trip, but in Arlon you can already buy a ticket for any 10 trips within Belgium (for any number of passengers) for 76 euros. In total it will be cheaper than taking a direct train to Brussels.

The most interesting feature of Luxembourg is that for some reason this small country is chosen by labor migrants from Portugal. The Portuguese come here to work as cleaners...

And housekeepers. All the sellers in the supermarket near the station also spoke Portuguese.

Apparently, there is a whole crowd of Portuguese here, so you can put up advertisements directly in Portuguese and count on the right people to understand.
