<h1>Poland: Poznan, Wroclaw, Krakow, Oswiecim, Zakopane</h1>
<i>11-15 February 2015</i>
<h2>Poznan</h2>
<p>
It’s always nice to come back to Poland, it’s cheap and they speak my favorite Slavic language.

The best grocery store is Biedronka (Ladybug). Everything is cheap there, many goods are even cheaper than in Russia, for example apples cost about 30 rubles per kilogram.

Town Hall. I remember that as a child I played a lot of the “Cossacks” strategy, where this particular building was the city center if you played as Poland.

Cities in western Poland have a very similar structure: the central square is large and square, with buildings still standing in the middle, so it looks like a square with holes in it.
<p/>

Two people can easily eat for five euros. The average price of a dish is around 1-1.5 euros.

<h2>Wroclaw</h2>
<p>
Wroclaw became Polish after the Second World War. Before that it was called Breslau. It has something in common with <a href="../kaliningrad">Königsberg</a>.

There was a gigantic queue at one establishment, half the street long. I looked in out of curiosity, they sold donuts there. In the neighboring "Bedronka" there was also a sale that day; they were selling delicious donuts for 45 groszy, i.e. $0.10 each, they sold like hotcakes.

<h2>Krakow</h2>
<p>
It so happened that I began my acquaintance with Krakow not with the most famous sights, but with the Nowa Huta district, which was built during communism for workers of the local metallurgical plant. I went there to find out if the monument to the yellow pissing Lenin mentioned in the news was still there. Unfortunately, the monument was removed somewhere, but at least I saw an unusual place.
Before the overthrow of communism, there was a monument to Lenin on this street.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256293991_ee5726ab50_o.jpg">
<p>
It has a romantic name: Rose Alley.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257335095_9c7c89e119_o.jpg">
<p>
Nowa Huta was built in Stalin's times, so it is not a collection of Khrushchev buildings, but quite a block in the Empire style. Moreover, there are even stands for tourists.
<p/>

The most unusual building is the local church.

<p>
The main attribute of communism, however, is preserved here. These are fences.
<p/>

<p>
Everything that the communists built is easy to recognize by the fences. An ideal commie city must look like a concentration camp.

<p>
Finally, the city center. Krakow is the most touristic city in Poland, even in February there was a gigantic crowd in the center. I’m afraid to imagine how it is in the summer, probably like in <a href="../croatia">Dubrovnik</a>. At the same time, to be honest, Wroclaw and <a href="../poland">Gdansk</a>, in my opinion, are more beautiful.

<p>
People here really like to cheat on currency exchange. What's wrong? It looks very tempting - euro = 4.20 zlotys (usually in those days they gave 4.17-4.18). But if you take a closer look, this is a Special offer - <b>"We sell"</b>. It’s really profitable to exchange leftover zlotys for euros here. But buying zlotys is very unprofitable, the exchange rate is 3.124 instead of 4.18.
<p/>

Here's a simpler example: here buying and selling have been swapped. Usually you look at the rate on the left, but here it is the selling rate.

There is a small old town here, and next to it is the Jewish city of Kazimierz. Almost nothing remains of the Jewish city, although the synagogues still stand.

There are Jewish restaurants and symbols, but in reality there are no more Jews here than in <a href="../vladivostok">Birobidzhan</a>. Almost all were killed by the Nazis at the nearby Auschwitz camp, and the remainder mostly fled to Israel.

<p>
At the next bar I bought four euros worth of food. On the left is Zurek soup with egg. On the right is tomato soup. In the middle there is “bigos”, this is meat with stewed cabbage. Zurek alone would be enough to satisfy my hunger, and I could barely finish the bigos. These dishes are even more satisfying than the dishes of <a href="../mongolia">Mongolian cuisine</a>, despite the fact that by European standards it’s almost free!

<h2>Oswiecim</h2>
<p>
Auschwitz is the third Nazi camp I visited after <a href="../munich">Dachau</a> and <a href="../berlin">Sachsenhausen</a>. I have already talked about such places, so this time I will give the floor to the “heroes” themselves.
<p/>

In previous years, imprisoned Jews hoped that one day they would be freed, and this greatly alleviated the mental suffering caused by their imprisonment. But the Jews of Auschwitz no longer had such hopes. They all, without exception, knew that they were sentenced to death, that they would remain alive only as long as they could work. And the majority did not console themselves with hopes of changing their gloomy fate. They were fatalists. They patiently and indifferently endured the hardships and torments of imprisonment. The inability to avoid a certain end made them mentally completely indifferent to the outside world. This mental decay accelerated the physical one. They no longer had the will to live, nothing excited them, the slightest bodily shock paralyzed them. They knew that death was inevitable sooner or later. I insist that, judging by my observations, the high mortality rate of Jews was not the result for the majority of hard, unusual work, insufficient nutrition, overcrowding of barracks and other problems and hardships of camp life, but mainly and primarily the result of a mental state.

The RFSS (Himmler) demanded fulfillment of duty, personal dedication even to the point of self-denial. Everyone in Germany had to give their all so that we could win the war. By the will of the RFSS, camps were used in the production of weapons. Like everyone else, I was a subordinate. All prejudices had to be discarded. This was evidenced by the fact that he deliberately ignored the conditions in the camp, which were becoming unbearable. It was necessary to make weapons; everything that interfered with this had to be eliminated. I wasn't the one who could afford to resist it internally. I had to treat the needs of the prisoners even more harshly, even colder, even more ruthlessly.
<p/>

I saw everything well, sometimes too well, but I could not do anything. No disaster could stop me on this path. All considerations became meaningless in view of the ultimate goal: we must win the war. This is how I saw my task back then. I couldn’t go to the front; for the sake of the front, I had to do the most terrible things in my homeland. Today I see that my haste and desire to move forward would not have helped win the war either. But then I firmly believed in the possibility of achieving the ultimate goal, and believed that for this I should work without respite.

By the will of the RFSS, Auschwitz became the greatest death factory of all time. When in the summer of 1941 he personally gave me the order to prepare a site for mass extermination in Auschwitz and to carry out such extermination, I had no idea of their scale or consequences. Perhaps this order contained something unusual, something monstrous. But the motives for such an order seemed correct to me.. I didn’t reason then - I was given an order - I had to carry it out. Whether this mass extermination of Jews was necessary or not, I could not reason; the time had not yet come for this. Since the Fuhrer himself ordered the “final solution to the Jewish question,” the old National Socialists did not dare to hesitate, especially the SS officers. “The Fuhrer ordered, we carry out” - this was by no means a phrase or a saying for us. This saying had to be taken seriously. Since my arrest, I have been constantly told that I could have evaded the execution of this order, that I could have shot Himmler.
I don’t think that even one of the thousands of SS officers could have come up with such an idea. It would simply be impossible.

<p>
Gas asphyxiation was carried out in the punishment cells of block 11. I myself watched the murder, wearing a gas mask. Death in crowded cells occurred immediately after the face-off. A short, muffled cry - and it was all over. The first asphyxiation of people with gas did not immediately reach my consciousness; perhaps I was too impressed by the whole process. What left a deeper imprint on my memory was the strangulation of 900 Russians in the old crematorium, which occurred soon after, because the use of block 11 required too many conditions to be met. During unloading, numerous holes were simply made in the ground and in the concrete roof of the morgue. The Russians had to undress in the hallway, and then they calmly walked to the morgue, because they were told that their lice would be destroyed. The morgue accommodated just the entire transport. The doors were closed and gas was poured in through the openings. I don't know how long the murder lasted. But for a long time the noise was still heard. During the throw-in, some shouted: “Gas,” there was a loud roar, and they began to break into both doors from the inside. But they withstood the onslaught.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257645245_2e5dcbd6b5_o.jpg">
<p>
Only a few hours later the doors were opened and the room was ventilated. Here for the first time I saw a mass of people suffocated with gas. An unpleasant feeling, even horror, came over me, although I imagined death from gas to be more terrible. Again and again I imagined the agony of those being suffocated. However, the corpses did not show any signs of convulsions. As the doctors explained to me, hydrocyanic acid paralyzes the lungs, but its effect was so fast and strong that it did not cause symptoms of suffocation, as happens with suffocation, for example, with lamp gas or by deprivation of air. I didn’t think about killing the Russian prisoners of war themselves at that time. I was ordered, I had to carry out the order. I must admit that this gassing reassured me, since the mass extermination of Jews was soon foreseen, but neither Eichmann nor I had any idea of the means of killing the expected masses. Probably with the help of gas, but how to use it, and what kind of gas? And now we have discovered both the gas and the method.

I was always afraid of executions when I thought about the masses, about women and children. I have already given many orders about executions, about group executions, coming from the RFSS or RSHA. But now I have calmed down: we will all be spared the bloodbaths, and the victims will also experience gentle treatment until the last moment. This was precisely what bothered me most when I recalled Eichmann’s stories about the mowing down of Jews from the MG and MP by the Einsatzkommandos. At the same time, terrible scenes were played out: attempts of those shot to escape, killings of the wounded, especially women and children. Often members of the Einsatzkommando committed suicide, no longer having the strength to bathe in blood. Most of the soldiers of these Einsatzkommandos tried to distract themselves from their terrible work with the help of alcohol. According to Höfle's stories, Globocnik's men, who served at the liquidation sites, consumed a lot of alcohol.

In the spring of 1942, hundreds of blooming, unsuspecting people walked under the blooming fruit trees of a peasant estate to die in a gas chamber. This picture of blossoming and disappearing into oblivion still seems to stand before my eyes.

<p>
For everyone who was involved in this monstrous “work”, those assigned to this “service”, as well as myself, these processes forced me to think deeply and left deep traces in their souls. Most of those involved during my rounds of extermination sites often came up to me to share their depressed state and reassure themselves about what I could tell them. In their confidential stories, I constantly heard questions: “Is what we must do really necessary? Is it really necessary to destroy hundreds of thousands of women and children?” And I, having asked myself the same questions countless times, was forced to get rid of them with the order of the Fuhrer and thereby console them. I had to tell them that Jewry must be destroyed in the name of Germany, in order to forever rid our descendants of their sworn enemies.
<p/>

<p>
Of course, for all of us, the Fuhrer's orders were subject to strict execution, especially for the SS. And yet everyone was tormented by doubts. I myself did not dare to reveal my doubts under any circumstances. To maintain the mental fortitude of my fellow soldiers, I had to behave as if I were made of stone during the execution of this monstrously cruel order.
<p/>

<p>
The RFSS sent various party and SS functionaries to Auschwitz so that they could see for themselves how Jews were exterminated. Everyone received deep impressions. Some of those who had previously spoken about the need for such destruction were speechless at the sight of the “final solution to the Jewish question.” I was constantly asked how I and my people could witness such a thing, how we were able to endure all this. To this I always answered that all human impulses must be suppressed and give way to iron determination with which the orders of the Fuhrer must be carried out. Each of these gentlemen stated that they would not like to receive such an assignment.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257645360_696d4fd285_o.jpg">
<p>
I discussed with Eichmann many times and in detail everything that was connected with the final solution to the Jewish question, without in any way revealing my inner suffering. I tried in every way to bring out in Eichmann his inner, true opinion about this “final solution.” But even during our long drinking sessions alone with each other, he remained an obsessive supporter of the total extermination of all Jews who could be reached. We had to carry out the destruction cold-bloodedly, without mercy, and as quickly as possible. The slightest delay in this will later be cruelly avenged. In view of such iron determination, I had to hide my human doubts.

Yes, I must admit that my humane impulses seemed to me - after such conversations with Eichmann - almost a betrayal of the Fuhrer. I had no way out of my mental discord. I had to continue the process of destruction, continue the massacres, continue to coolly observe what deeply worried me inside. I had to take all incidents calmly.

According to the order of the RFSS, issued in the summer of 1941, all Jews were to be liquidated. RSHA strongly doubted the expediency of the order of the RFSS, which, at the suggestion of Paul, ordered the selection of those able to work. The RSHA has always advocated the total extermination of Jews. In every new work camp, in every thousand recognized as able to work, it saw the danger of their liberation, of saving their lives due to some circumstances. No authority was more interested in increasing the mortality rate of Jews than the Jewish department of the RSHA. Paul, on the contrary, had instructions from the RFSS to involve as many prisoners as possible in the work on creating weapons. Therefore, he tried to save as many prisoners as possible, that is, as many able-bodied Jews as possible from those who arrived to liquidate the transports. He also attached great importance to preserving the workforce, although he was not very successful at this. Thus, the RSHA and the WFHA held opposing points of view.

Concentration camps were designed, partly also unintentionally, to become places for the extermination of huge masses. From the RSHA, the commandants were given extensive information reports about Russian concentration camps. From the prisoners who escaped from them, everything became known to the smallest details about the organization of these camps and the situation in them. It was especially emphasized that by organizing enormous forced labor, the Russians destroyed entire nationalities. If, for example, during the construction of a canal, the prisoners of the camp were completely used up, new thousands of kulaks or other unreliable elements were created, which after some time were also completely spent.

I will always be reproached for not avoiding the execution of the extermination order, this monstrous murder of women and children. But I already answered in Nuremberg: what then to do with the commander of an aviation squadron who could evade a raid on a city about which he knew for sure that there were no weapons, no weapons factories, no military factories there? When did he know for sure that his bombs would kill primarily women and children? After all, he would immediately go to court. I would not like to consider this a comparison, but I believe that both situations are comparable. I'm a soldier too. I, like him, am an officer. Even if today they want to consider the Waffen-SS not military, but a type of party militia. But we were the same soldiers as the other three branches of the army.

On the way, in one peasant estate, we heard that the Fuhrer was dead. When we found out about this, my wife and I thought the same thing at the same time: now we have to leave too! Our world perished along with the Fuhrer. Did it make sense for us to continue living? They will pursue us, they will look for us everywhere. We wanted to take poison. I prepared it for my wife, so that in the event of a sudden Russian breakthrough, she would take it with her children and not fall into their hands. And yet we didn't do it for the sake of the children. For them, we had to face the inevitable future. But it would be better if we didn't do this. Later I always regretted this. We, especially my wife and children, would have been spared a lot. And what else will they experience? We were connected and shackled with that world - we should have died with it.

It is a war of ideologies and struggle races. On one side stands National Socialism: ideology, founded on the values of our Germanic, Nordic blood. It is worth the world as we want to see: beautiful, orderly, fair, socially, a world that may be, still suffers some flaws, but overall a happy, beautiful world filled with culture, which is precisely Germany. On the other side stands the 180 millionth people, a mixture of races and peoples, whose names are unpronounceable, and whose physical nature is such that the only thing that they can do - is to shoot without pity or mercy. These animals, which are subjected to torture and ill-treatment of each prisoner from our side, which do not have medical care they captured our wounded, as do the decent men, you will see them for yourself. These people have joined a Jewish religion, one ideology, called Bolshevism, with the task of: having now Russian, half [located] in Asia, parts of Europe, crush Germany and the world.

When you, my friends, are fighting in the East, you keep that same fight against the same subhumans, against the same inferior races that once appeared under the name of Huns, and later - 1,000 years ago during the time of King Henry and Otto I, - the name of the Hungarians, and later under the name of Tatars, and then they came again under the name of Genghis Khan and the Mongols. Today they are called Russian under the political banner of Bolshevism

To get from Poland to Slovakia, you need to drive through the Carpathians.

In Zakopane, a signature Polish dish - smoked cheese "oscypki" - is sold at every corner. At the market, one piece (round, like in the foreground) costs 1 zloty. Large from 8 to 14.

In Zakopane, minibuses travel around the area, just like in the former USSR. Nowhere else in Europe have I seen regular minibus services; they are usually used for private transfers.
