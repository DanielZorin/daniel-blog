<h1>Israel: Jerusalem, Eilat</h1>
<i>5-9 January 2014</i>
<h2>Jerusalem</h2>
<p>
If I were a religious person, visiting Jerusalem, I would immediately renounce religion forever. Here it is the easiest to see all the idiocy of worshiping fairy-tale heroes and objects with a murky history, to realize how clever businessmen have been taking advantage of the stupidity and naivety of people for many centuries, scamming them out of money out of nowhere.

<p>
Old Jerusalem has four quarters: Arab, Jewish, Armenian and Christian (for Catholics and Orthodox). Most people are in Christian. The entire quarter has been turned into an endless market of pseudo-religious and general tourist souvenirs, with neither end nor edge in sight. What is typical is that it is mainly Arabs who trade, as it is allowed by their religion.

If there was room to squeeze a souvenir shop into the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, they would put it there.

<p>
Nothing sacred or spiritual is felt here even close. The business center of the Russian Orthodox Church on Krasnopresnenskaya is even more spiritual.

Crowds of zombies with crosses and gloomy chants are sometimes found on the streets.

The best time to explore Jerusalem is in the evening.

<p>
The souvenir shops close, the tourists on bus tours leave, and you can see the ugly side of this city.

In some ways it reminded me of Half-life.

You can calmly walk and look at Via Dolorosa, where numbers indicate the stages of Jesus’ journey to Calvary. The epic nature of the story in the Bible does not correspond somewhat to the real scale of the street, which is very short.
<p/>

Pilate's trial took place here.

And Jesus and 9,000 other pilgrims touched here.

All this should not mislead the attentive observer. The entire Via Dolorosa was built much later than the biblical events, as was the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. 2000 years ago, the city was generally on a different level, which can be seen from the remains of a wall somewhere in a pit.

What's nice is that the city continues to grow. Somewhere I got lost and ended up on a roof, although I didn’t go inside the buildings.

I had to look for a way down to the street.

In the place where the Last Supper took place, an administrator's reception room was set up.

The Jewish king David is buried down there. Near his grave, boys in black clothes with sidelocks are dancing merrily, a hilarious sight.

Lots of unnecessary graves.

Religious Jews are even weirder than religious Christians. This is why they are very much “loved” by non-religious Jews who have to work for themselves and for that guy.

There is a crowd near the women's part of the Western Wall, which is half as long as the men's.

Outside the Christian quarter, the old city of Jerusalem is very cozy.
<p/>

There are no crowds.

The Palestinians want to take part of Jerusalem for themselves, but the Jews do not agree with this; the entire city is de facto under their control.

On the gate on the Arab side there are bullet marks left over from the assault during the 1967 war.

<p>
Until 1967, the old city was under Jordanian control, and access there was not nearly as free as it is now.

I had been to Jerusalem once before, in 2009 on an excursion from Egypt. Then I actually saw nothing except the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, which once again confirms the pointlessness of excursions.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255500947_c8262605cc_o.jpg">
<p>
This time I used Jerusalem as a base to explore the Palestinian Territories, where I traveled for all three days. Therefore, there wasn’t really enough time to explore Jerusalem outside the old city.
<p/>

More modern Jerusalem looks something like this.

<p>
There is a tram along the main street. There is only one line for now. A ticket costs about $2 (everything is not cheap in Israel).

The farthest place I've been is Calatrava's String Bridge (remember <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/255725.html">Valencia</a>, <a href="http://juan. livejournal.com/313904.html">Bilbao</a>, <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/245452.html">Malmo</a>).

<h2>Eilat</h2>
<p>
The main attraction of the city of Eilat is the airport.
<p/>

<p>
It is located right in the middle of the city, the runway divides the city in two.

This is a paradise for those who like to photograph landing planes, although I don’t understand this hobby.
<p/>

Otherwise, Eilat is a city built in the desert relatively recently.

It looks like all the other resorts in Egypt, Turkey and similar resort countries.

The tourists here are mainly Israelis themselves (who find it cheap and close) and Russians (who don’t need a visa). Previously, local hotels focused on people who came on vouchers from local trade unions and charged as much as they could, but now you can rent accommodation not so expensively. Although in neighboring Taba and <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/311423.html">Aqaba</a> it is still much cheaper, and it is better to relax there, if you are going to relax.

Eilat is important because it has a border with Jordan, where you also do not have to pay for the Jordanian visa.
