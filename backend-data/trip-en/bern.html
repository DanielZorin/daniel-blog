<h1>Switzerland: Martigny, Sion, Zermatt, Brig, Thun, Interlaken, Lauterbrunnen, Bern, Fribourg, Lausanne, Geneva</h1>
<i>17-19 November 2019</i>
<h2>Martigny</h2>
<p>
The train leaves from the French station, goes through a tunnel, and five minutes later it’s the Chatlard border station, this is where Switzerland begins, and trains go to this station more often than to the French one.

<p>
The train is still high in the mountains, there are only small villages, and a huge abyss below.

At this station the train stopped, and all passengers were transferred to a bus, since further movement was suspended due to repair work.

We arrive in the city of Martigny. There is no snow here because it is at the very bottom of the valley. This canton is called the Valley (Valais in French). Here is the station.
<p/>

This is what the city looks like, somehow it’s not even particularly fabulous.

That day I had an unlimited pass on Swiss railways, so I immediately went further east.

<h2>Sion</h2>
<p>
The capital of the canton of Valais is the city of Sion, called Sitten in German. It is located in the middle of the valley.

<p>
Soon after leaving Sion, announcements on the train begin to be read first in German and then in French. Valais is a bilingual canton, approximately 65 to 35 French/German, and the German part is eastern. There, the names of the cities are not French (Martigny, Sion), but German: Visp, Brig, Zermatt.

<h2>Zermatt</h2>
<p>
While it was autumn in Sion, in the next city of Visp it was the height of winter, snow was falling like buckets, I haven’t seen this for a long time.

In Visp, a branch line departs from the main railway line to the Matterhorn mountain - one of the most beautiful railroads in Switzerland. Travel there is not cheap (and there are no discounts for purchasing in advance), but you can get through with a pass.

Cars are prohibited here; they must be parked near the penultimate station. These mini-buses, similar in size to tuk-tuks, travel around the city.

The city has an unusual layout: there are two stations, and near each there is a cluster of buildings (the western one has more), and between them there is a large field.
<p/>

In 2019, Interlaken proved to be a very popular destination among Chinese tourists. There are many groups here, signs in Chinese, Chinese cafes, and hotels are also owned by the Chinese, I stayed in one for about 50 euros, which is cheap for Switzerland.

In general, such places usually look brighter in photographs than in reality, since filters are added to the photographs, contrast is increased, etc. But here it’s the other way around, especially indicative of winter photographs, which on Google are somehow completely inexpressive. Maybe I was lucky enough to get a good snow day.

<h2>Bern</h2>
<p>
Finally, I visited not only all the countries of Europe, but also all the capitals: the capital of Switzerland last eluded me. Bern is not the largest city in the country (fifth after Zurich, Geneva, Lausanne and Basel), and does not even have its own full-fledged airport, fortunately it is in the middle between Zurich and Geneva, and you can get directly to both airports in an hour and a half.

Looking at the map, I thought that the city was located near the lake shore that could be easily reached. But in reality it turned out that Lausanne is located on the slope of a very steep hill, almost all the streets here are at a steep angle, and walking is not so easy - the constant changes in elevation take a lot of energy.

Prices at the counter in a business hotel. Interestingly, rooms are cheaper here on weekends: 129 francs versus 159, because Lausanne is not a tourist city, but more of a business city, people come here for all sorts of conferences.

<h2>Geneva</h2>
<p>
The last city in Switzerland was Geneva, the main French-speaking city located right on the border with France at the end of a narrow ledge of Swiss territory. Before Switzerland joined the Schengen zone, the local airport even had two different exits - one through the Swiss border guards, the other through the French. Geneva is similar to Zurich in that here, too, Swiss show-offs such as expensive watches and boutiques immediately catch the eye.
