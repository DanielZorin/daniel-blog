<h1>France: Dijon, Amiens, Rouen, Paris</h1>
<i>20-25 November 2019</i>
<h2>Dijon</h2>
<p>
Dijon is the capital of the Burgundy region. In 2016, it was merged with neighboring Franche-Comté into one large province.

The city center was not damaged by wars and is well preserved. Almost the entire old part is pedestrian.

On the side of the cathedral chapel, a small statue of an owl has been preserved since the 15th century, which all passers-by loved to rub.

French driving school. As you can see, getting a license in France costs more than 1,000 euros even in the best case scenario. One lesson costs 43 euros, I'm not sure if it's full hour or 40 minutes. In any case, 20 hours, even full ones, is not enough, you need 30-35.

<h2>Amiens</h2>
<p>
The city of Amiens is the capital of the Picardy region in northern France, annexed to Pas-de-Calais in 2016. This is an atypical French city, as this region suffered greatly during the First World War.

<h2>Paris</h2>
<p>
I have been to Paris several times already, but the last time was quite a long time ago, in <a href="../paris">2013-2014</a>. I like Paris, so I budgeted more days for it at the end. In addition to seeing the Champs Elysees and Montmartre more than once, I also took a ride through some places that were new to me. The first morning after arriving in Paris, I headed to the northwestern suburb, the La Défense district.

Previously, I always took packs of 10 single tickets, but now they went up to almost 17 euros, and this time I usually traveled with a day pass. This ticket is called Mobilis, and if you don’t know what it is, you won’t understand from the name that it’s a regular ticket for the day, available to everyone. It costs 7.50 (for two zones, but I didn’t go further), that is, it pays for itself on the fifth trip.

French food stamps.

Let's look at a supermarket in France. This is a store of the most famous and popular chain Carrefour (means "crossroads"). The stores of this chain range from small and more expensive ones in the city center to hypermarkets further from the center. This is Carrefour in the suburbs of Paris, near the Mairie des Lilas metro station. Prices in France are, of course, in euros.
