<h1>Italy: Milan, Como, Turin, Genoa, Ventimiglia</h1>
<i>4-5, 9-11, 16-17 March 2014</i>
<h2>Milan</h2>
<p>
Milan is not what people usually think of when they hear the word “Italy”. The city itself is quite good, although I agree that compared to some other Italian cities there is really not much to see here.
<p/>

<p>
Milan has skyscrapers almost in the very center of the city!
<p/>

<p/>

<p>
People usually come here to shop.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256440236_10751f2b45_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I’m not a big expert in shopping, so I didn’t see any fundamental difference between Milan and other major cities in Italy and other Western European countries. Except that here the stores of all well-known companies are concentrated in a small area.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256640028_7a9657c95e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Prices for suits from Brioni.

<p>
Vertu store.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255711687_c544d72479_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The city is evenly spattered with chewing gum.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255712007_df66d7ac8e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And littered with confetti.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257187839_dcaa04bf30_h.jpg"/>
<p>
For smokers in Milan, special storm drain grates have been made. They are very long, and underneath there are piles of cigarette butts.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256787241_6ef11a6ef1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Street signs explain the name.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257483130_29716904a0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Moscow Street flows into USA Square.
<p/>

<p>
The low-quality index was probably ordered from Russia.
<p/>

<p>
Distances to hatches.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256440196_4a02b398a6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Drinking fountains are very common in Milan. The coat of arms of Milan can easily be confused with the flag of England.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256787161_6d48f7108f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Signs on the road are lengthened, as in <a href="../hong-kong">Hong Kong</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255711622_bdb86a8492_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a political struggle going on in the streets.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256440081_68e76022b4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a promotion for fighters to distribute noodles for advertising purposes.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257483310_414b4aa036_h.jpg"/>
<p>
We have our own veterans. I will try to translate this inscription in full to the best of my modest knowledge of Italian:
Self-taught disabled worker
1. Physically disabled person
2. I see your desires and weaknesses
3. I am a scientist, an expert on everything.
4. I have difficulties because of you
5. Your government representatives are crap.
6. If you want me to help you, give me the Sforza Castle in Milan, etc.
7. I am writing a civil code for the whole world that will put an end to wars and famines, give equal laws to everyone and recognize rights... (not visible further).
<p/>

“If you see a dung, it means a dog has passed by, whose owner is made of shit!”
<p/>

<p>
Let's walk through the sights of Milan.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256640118_8a3523ffb4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Teatro La Scala. There are tickets at incredible prices, around 10-15 euros, but I didn’t have time to go. Not impressive from the outside.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255711747_aec13a5562_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Sforza Castle. A wall with battlements like in the Moscow Kremlin.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257534124_3aeb4630bb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Old trams.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256440391_3c354e1f35_h.jpg"/>
<p>
"The Last Supper" by Leonardo. The organization is simply disgraceful. Obviously, the hype is artificially created, so tickets must be purchased via the Internet two months in advance. To see the Sistine Chapel in Rome or the Mona Lisa in Paris, you do not need to buy tickets in advance, and they have not yet burst due to the influx of visitors.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257187904_a3d1b90e17_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the subway, the cars are painted in the color of the line on the map.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257483550_b79a1bdd72_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The hallway to the platform at Milan-Porta Garibaldi station (next to the business center) is absolutely gorgeous. I recommend.
<p/>

<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256640238_0f54ec5b77_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Como</h2>
<p>
A small town on the shore of a lake, just like in Switzerland.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256779039_4821d4d9d3_h.jpg"/>

<p>
There is a funicular going up.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256779084_42742fec22_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Museum of physicist Alexander Volta in the form of an ancient temple.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256231483_c5905108e8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Railway station.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257074580_dbfb7b161e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are separate mailboxes for letters within the city and to other places. Though, both are boarded up.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256030826_702bbb3518_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Turin</h2>
<p>
I was lucky to be in Turin on Sunday. On Sunday in Italy everyone goes out for a walk, sing songs, dance and have fun. In the central square, the people were entertained by an entertainer-magician.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255661736_d6eeb7fed8_h.jpg"/>

<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255661761_4382991c59_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On the next street, right on the cramped sidewalk, a large crowd of grandmothers had gathered, singing some Italian folk songs with a guitar. They were playing rock and roll in the corner.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254932482_dde9002393_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Everyone came out to either perform or watch.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256411209_0c7a1459f9_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256410689_3ea508fef1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It's quite funny to imagine the design that these mimes have hidden in their sleeves.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256410574_f9c3b44454_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Of course, one cannot miss brisk trade in bedspreads.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255661801_32a237d137_h.jpg"/>
<p>
After this, it immediately becomes clear why shops in Italy operate on such a strange schedule: on Monday they open only in the evening.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255866268_65d6cec61c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Only the market is open on Monday morning.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256411254_f1b1bb61b7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In general, Turin turned out to be a wonderful city. Compared to Milan, it is clearly underrated. Piedmont and Liguria are slightly off the main tourist routes between Milan, Venice, Florence and Rome.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256707010_1f38f4a369_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Turin is unusual in that it is built on a grid, like the cities of <a href="../../country/usa">USA</a> and <a href="../argentina">Argentina</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256706730_60acfff003_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Long streets.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256706900_10e0e5f61f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But large areas.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256411039_98bcc50956_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Turin finally captivated me with the graffiti from my favorite childhood game (anyone else played it?) on the wall.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255865708_3106dd7a3e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Great city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256410514_6cb73b730e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
People still drive old small cars.
<p/>

Stretching for world peace.
<p/>

<p>
Job advertisements are posted in churches.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255661256_98dc8fec92_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Sundial.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254932777_e252af4b83_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Monument in the corner?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256411349_786e016bd3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This monument is used as an urn.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255865758_ffc60c3753_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A strange monument to Duke Ferdinand of Savoy on a falling horse.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255866158_4a130f38a7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
“Why is water wet?”, “Why is sugar sweet?”
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256707120_51c48081e2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The Turin synagogue, which was not accepted by the Jews, was given over to a cinema museum.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256124282_9dd1562264_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Turin trams are similar to those in Milan.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254932132_d7fd1106a2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also one metro line in the city, which was built for the 2006 Winter Olympics. The design is similar to the metro of <a href="../sao-paulo">Sao Paulo</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254932877_ac911e5f56_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Well, we can’t help but say a few words about the most famous landmark of Turin.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256707170_52e0e01191_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The Shroud of Turin is kept in a sarcophagus under special climatic conditions and is exhibited every few years. I'm afraid to imagine how long the line is.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254932342_7723ef97bb_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Genoa</h2>
<p>
I already <a href="../austria">wrote</a> that in Europe it’s hard to surprise me with anything, because I’ve seen a lot of old cities. In Italy, my admiration was aroused by one city that for some reason is ignored, considered dirty and overcrowded with migrants. Welcome to Genoa - the most unusual Italian city, where you need to walk with your head thrown back and your mouth open.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255390827_d788819bbe_h.jpg"/>
<p>
<a href="../vyborg">St Petersburg</a> is called northern Venice, but it can also be called northern Genoa, because you won’t find such courtyards-wells anywhere else.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257163555_c9d3832b16_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256744831_1157213725_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Genoa has very narrow streets (they are called "caruggi") and very tall buildings.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256945033_12a47f82e3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It's a little dark down there even during the day.

Laundry is dried everywhere.
<p/>

<p>
Typical Italian shutters.

<p/>

<p>
Among ordinary houses there are real palaces of the nobility.
<p/>

<p>
Sometimes some relic from more ancient times intersperses among the baroque.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256745656_8fbf795ac7_h.jpg"/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256016707_41040c5a40_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It doesn't hurt to look up in churches either.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257163420_faf8b2cd99_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257163805_032d91ae19_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Well, now, having looked up enough, you can go down to the ground.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256745761_352ee576fc_h.jpg"/>
<center> * * * </center>
<p>
Now you can look at Genoa from top to bottom.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256121356_5d5415b2b9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Since Genoa is located on the hills, in addition to one metro line, there is a whole system of funiculars and elevators with an integrated payment system.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255391147_b196ca39e4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I rode to the top of Mount Rigi, but the view from there was mostly obscured by trees and houses.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257163950_b4c56a7932_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257164015_2d1cd0b81d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But you can look at the other side of the mountain.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256121206_768268abe6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Someone threw a washbasin right into the street. It seems that it’s not New Year’s (when in Italy, according to tradition, old things are thrown away).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256121251_df96390085_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Elevators are also public transport.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256869349_174f661067_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The view is much better from here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256320638_27e63f63c3_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p>
Passage on the roof.
<p/>

<p>
Palaces on Via Garibaldi.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256869534_952cf37433_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The yard is a semi-well.
<p/>

<p>

Garden on the roof.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257164280_6ad93bc98f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Let's go down to the ground.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256320463_b7bccb1aa8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are special barriers at the entrances to the center to prevent people from entering.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256868869_16e9414e4d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Motorcycles are more popular here than cars.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256120766_d289e35db4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
They drive along wider streets.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255390597_d97f6cd153_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On narrow ones they are banned.
<p/>

<p>

<p/>

<p>
Here is some pompous door to a modest building.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257163685_7a0bde221a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You come in, and there...
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257787365_3d990cfcb9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Genoa has very unusual national colors - black and white. Parisian <a href="../paris">striped columns</a> would be on point here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256745566_0aa9f5c8da_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Even the columns in the church are striped.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256120791_fa10ad2a13_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Genoa has two problems. The first is contempt for public spaces.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257490264_5a76b885f0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
They draw more here than the Italian average.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255390967_bb6be43c5e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Someone set up a meeting on New Year's eve in Arabic.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255391027_a4955934ca_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Also, the back streets here are not always clean.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256016617_e144d74a15_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The second problem of Genoa is the huge highway that runs right along the seashore along the old city.

If I were the mayor of Genoa, the first thing I would do would be to demolish this squalor.

<h2>Ventimiglia</h2>
<p>
Although there are no borders in Europe, their traces are very visible. For example, railway communications between countries are an order of magnitude less developed than domestic ones. There are practically no local trains that travel across borders, only high-speed or night trains. It is almost always cheaper to travel to a border station on one rail network and leave on another. In the case of Italy and France, the border station is Ventimiglia, Italian trains end here, and French trains go from here.

The beach here is dirty and rocky. Although formally this is also the Cote d'Azur.
