Nearby, on the Maidan, a strange man preached through a loudspeaker, talked about how the government was destroying the country and called for repentance.

<p>
I also decided, to the best of my modest strength, to participate in Ukrainian politics. An activist who came up from the tent city shook my hand and advised me to also sign “May he die!”
</p>

In general, life in Kyiv is fun!

Kyiv is a city of not only political, but also visual contrasts. In the city center there are modern buildings, a lot of cars, advertising...
</p>

</p>

If you go further, you can find yourself in the eighties. Here is the residential area from afar, it looks solid.
</p>

<p>
If you wander around the outskirts, you can find many fragments of the past. Here is a modern supermarket "Selpo".

<p>

<p>
And somewhere there is no lighting in the underground passage, and it seems that you are walking in some kind of bunker.
</p>

<p>
There are old bus schedules on the streets.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256328826_ccdaa533b3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And the buses are already new, on par with the old minibuses.
