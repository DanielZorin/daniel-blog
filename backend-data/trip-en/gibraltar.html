<h1>Gibraltar</h1>
<i>23 July 2016</i>
<p>
Gibraltar is a small peninsula in southern Spain, which became a British possession following the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714). The Spaniards still demand the rock back, but the locals don’t want it. Previously, the rock was of great strategic importance, now it is more of an offshore, and military bases have been turned into museums.
In 2016, Gibraltar began to admit Russian citizens with a Schengen visa. Makes sense - anyway, 99% of people visit Gibraltar for one day from Spain. It’s still impossible to get to England through Gibraltar; staying there illegally is extremely unlikely - the country is too small to hide. Most likely, previously nobody cared to update the visa rules, because the vast majority of tourists are from the European Union, Canada, the USA, Australia, Japan and Korea anyway; they do not need visas. I can assume that entry with a Schengen visa was made primarily for the Chinese, who visit Europe more and more.

Gibraltar is like Britain. There are British street signs named after British heroes.

<p>
British postboxes (this one, by the way, has been here since the time of George VI, who reigned until 1952).

<p>
And this one is from the time of Edward VII (1901-1910).

The streets are the spitting image of <a href="../london">London</a>.

Prices are in pounds sterling. Very expensive, more expensive than Spain or France.

Prices at Burger King. The Whopper menu costs £7.70. Gibraltarians have an excellent appetite - they clearly prefer triple Whoppers.

The BK sign has been slightly changed.

In one respect only, Gibraltar is not Britain: here the overwhelming majority voted against Brexit in the referendum.

Under Franco, the border with Spain was closed for some time, so the British built an airport in Gibraltar, so you have to cross the runway on the way from the border. Now there are several flights a day from the airport, including low-cost flights to London.

<p>
Not just the airport, but most of the territory of Gibraltar was made artificially in the 20th century. Initially, this gate was the only entrance to the city from the mainland.

And under these walls there was the sea.

There are quite a few tourists in Gibraltar, but everyone walks along the main street.
<p/>

<p>
There is no one on the neighboring streets.

The fact that it was Sunday also contributed to the desertion.

The standard program in Gibraltar is to walk along the main street and climb to the top of the cliff by cable car. The price of 20 pounds seemed ridiculous to me (on the other hand, this is the only expense most tourists in this country have, so the desire to get the most is understandable), so I walked up. After <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/390230.html">Taishan</a>, <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/394743.html">Zhangjiajie</ a>, <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/248059.html">Sugarloaf</a>, <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/375859.html ">Monte Alban</a>, I climbed Gibraltar. The inside of the rock is all dug up with tunnels, some of them are abandoned, some have been turned into a museum, and some are still in use.

The hill climb begins on winding streets.

<p>
Next there is a staircase with a British flag.

<p>
Then there is a rocky path that leads up to the asphalt road. You can drive to the very top by car, but the entrance is at the far end of the cliff.
<p/>

Cacti grow on the slopes.

<p>
The views along the way are much better than the view from the top. Trees and the slope itself get in the way at the top, so it’s better to shoot from the middle. The cable car has an intermediate stop near a good viewpoint, but it was under repair.

<p>
The population of Gibraltar is already 30,000, despite the fact that the area is only 6 square kilometers, most of which is the rock. All new landfill areas are being developed with condominiums.

Interesting device. This is the beginning of a long trench dug inside the rock. The plan was to throw cannonballs into it so that they would fly out below at great speed and hit the ships besieging the fortress. In practice, something went wrong, the cannonballs fell into the city itself, and the improvised cannon was buried.

The last stage of the climb is a staircase going along the ancient fortress wall.

Everyone loves these monkeys very much - in Europe you don't see them in the wild often, but in Asia monkeys occupy every second temple or forest, and they managed to tire me with their impudence.
<p/>

<p>
Here they are also fearless - they even occupy cars.
<p/>

The monkey is tired of everything.

<p>
You can’t climb to the very top, there is a military base there. Lookout on the second peak.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256322373_6ec3f5b3ce_o.jpg">
<p>
There was also a military base here, but it was completely abandoned.
<p/>

<p>
That's exactly it.
<p/>

<p>
From the top you can look at the other side of the rock. There is only one road along the sea and a nice beach.
<p/>

<p>
At the top there was a strong wind, which was not felt during the climb, and fog.

View from the top. Behind the airport is the Spanish city of La Linea.

<p>
I also walked back through the airport. In Gibraltar, like in the UK, there is no exit passport control, and the Spanish border guard also did not even look at my passport. Here you can slip into the Schengen zone without a Schengen visa, however, to do this you need to get a much more problematic British visa in order to fly to Gibraltar via London.
In the end, I never supported Gibraltar's economy even with one penny: although it is a pleasant country, the prices there are steep.
