<h1>US Virgin Islands</h1>
<i>13 November 2016</i>
<p>
The US Virgin Islands were purchased by the US from <a href="../denmark">Denmark</a> (yes, even Denmark had colonies in the Caribbean, and even <a href="../latvia">Latvia</a>!). Denmark didn't have much use for them, and neither had America, but at least they have their own resort right in the Caribbean. There are also the British Virgin Islands nearby (the largest offshore in the world), ferries regularly run there, but Russian citizens need a visa, and even a British one will not work. When arriving from Puerto Rico, there is no passport control.

From the airport to the capital it is about three kilometers. A taxi costs closer to $10, so I walked.

The island is hilly, with houses on the slopes everywhere.

<p>
There is a beach with nice blue water near the airport.

Election campaign. On these small islands, elections are serious business too.

A giant overpass across a main road with little traffic.

<p>
Minibuses travel along the main road for $1 (you can get to the turnoff to the airport, from where it’s a 1-kilometer walk).

Cemetery, like in <a href="../texas">New Orleans</a>, with stone crypts.

The capital of the US Virgin Islands is called Charlotte Amalie.

Giant cruise ships come here, and tourists from them clog all the streets of this small town.

Street name signs are in Danish, in honor of the island's former owners.
<p/>

<p>
There are even authentic signs, just like in real Denmark.

<p>
There are old American traffic lights with the words “Don’t Walk” written on them. In modern ones, a palm is drawn.

Sexist advertising, like all men are stupid drunks who need to sit in the pub all day. If a cosmetics store had a sign that said “Leave your wife here all day,” feminists would curse it.

The first street from the embankment is full of shops.

90% of stores sell jewelry. What's the catch? Why should you buy diamonds on a cruise?
<p/>

<p>
All stores say "70% discount for Princess Cruises passengers." That day the ship of this particular company was in the port, tomorrow the lower part of the sign will be changed.

This looks so stupid that I don’t even know how you could fall for this. After examining this street, my face was all red from facepalms.
<p/>

<p>
What’s typical is that you won’t find tourists from a cruise ship even 10 meters from this street.
<p/>

It’s as if they don’t exist, although there are more of them than the entire population of the city.

There is a sign in the park that loitering is prohibited. But sitting on a bench in the park is loitering too, no? 
<p/>

The park is also a drug-free area. I'll know where to look for dealers, yeah.

Fort Christian is a small Danish fortress. Was closed.

A lot of flags.

This staircase to the top is called "99 steps", a local landmark.
<p/>

<p>
There are actually 102 steps.
