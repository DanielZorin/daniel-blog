<h1>Spain: Valencia, Xativa, Sagunt, Castellon de la Plana, Barcelona</h1>

<h2>Valencia</h2>
<p>
Once I was walking through Valencia, and in the square a crowd of people staged an all-out battle of all against all with pillows.

<p>
And then the pillow man appeared and defeated everyone.
<p/>

<p>
And the pillows flew into the air.

For the second year now I have been observing the notorious economic crisis in Spain. Every time I come, I see more and more people rummaging through garbage cans, more cardboard huts on the streets, and prices in shops and restaurants are getting lower. Once, in one of the quiet quarters of the center of Valencia, I came across a group of people who looked very much like Russian Gopniks. They kicked a wheelie bin and swore dirty. The back streets in the center of Valencia look like this.

A popular profession among local illegal immigrants from Africa: they stand on the road and show approaching cars where to park, expecting a “tip” from the drivers. These guys live in the park under the windows of my hotel, occupying several benches.
<p/>

<p>
Africans run all sorts of dubious businesses, and the role of guest workers in Europe belongs to the Bulgarians and Romanians. If you go to the local bus station, you will see that the most popular bus routes from Valencia are to Romania; you can go directly to a couple of dozen cities.

Well, enough about the sad stuff. Valencia is very good for children. This is the best playground I've ever seen.

Older children can visit the Science Museum or Aquarium in the City of Arts and Sciences. You can just take a walk there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256725485_c33b4ea187_o.jpg">
<p>
The City of Sciences and Arts was built at the former mouth of a river that was diverted after a flood 50 years ago. Now in place of the river there is a huge park stretching across the entire city. But the bridges remain.
<p/>

It's a three-hour train ride from Barcelona to Valencia, but the climate here is different and there are tangerine and lemon trees all over the city. There are several harvests a year, you can see fruits and flowers at the same time.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256430064_25c0b911da_o.jpg">
<p>
Nobody picks tangerines because they are wild and very sour.
<p/>

Valencia train station is worthy of special mention.

Here, not only are the walls tiled with wishes for a safe journey in different languages, but the antique cash register is still in operation.

<p>
In general, there is a lot of such beauty in Valencia, so I think that spending a week here was completely justified.

Please note that the signs of even well-known chains are small and do not spoil the facades of buildings.

<p>
Outside rush hour, the metro is generally empty; during rush hour there may be no seats. And here they are not afraid that someone will stuff a bomb into an urn; there are many urns in every carriage.

On Sunday there is no one in the city at all. Everyone goes on a picnic to the area of Lake Albufera, which is within the city limits, the southern outskirts of Valencia. The lake itself is not very clean, as is honestly written on the information signs.
<p/>

Valencia is officially bilingual, with signs usually in Valencian and Spanish. If the words are similar, sometimes the different letters are simply placed across a line, which can also be observed in bilingual Brussels.

<h2>Xativa</h2>
<p>
I know that the guys from the Russian Orthodox Church selflessly love money, especially when it is the last pennies of poor grandmothers. In order to diversify your sources of income, I’m throwing in a free business idea: automatic candles. You throw a coin and the candle lights up. Everything is naturalistic, the candles have a relief that imitates flowing wax. High technology lovers will be delighted!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256786860_cc4bb386b6_o.jpg">

<p>
In Xativa there is a rather picturesque fortress on a mountain.

The city itself is tiny.

<p>
Tourism is actively developing in the city, they came up with a fashionable logo in the form of the letter X, and there are signs everywhere showing how to get to various attractions. X is pronounced as [sh] in Valencian language, a sound that does not exist in standard Spanish. In Spanish this city is called Jativa.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255945053_7d3051da3c_o.jpg">
<p>
The inhabitants of Xativa are called "Setabense". A sign already familiar from Madrid informing that the house is insured against fire.

Housing in this excellent city can be bought for money that is absolutely ridiculous by Russian standards: from a million rubles (25000 euro), you can easily buy something for 3-4 (100000 euro). How much do apartments cost there in the center of Ivanovo? And from Sagunt it’s not five hours to civilization, but half an hour to Valencia and two and a half to Barcelona.

<h2>Castellon de la Plana</h2>
<p>
So that's it. There are bins, each for its own type of waste: glass, paper, etc. A machine arrives, collecting one type, and attaches a hook to the tank.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256197788_cf4883e8fd_o.jpg">

Voila - and the tank rises into the air, it turns out that it is cubic.

Castellon de la Plana is a large and not very medieval city, the capital of the province.

There are amazing benches in the central park. The Spaniards are not embarrassed by the fact that homeless people can sleep on benches (although in reality this is exactly what happens).

Even in Castellon (population only 170 thousand), public transport runs on dedicated lanes. The lane says Tram, but I think it's used by buses.

Before leaving, near the station I noticed probably the most shabby building in the entire province of Valencia.

<h2>Barcelona</h2>
<p>
Nothing has changed in Barcelona in two years, only metro tickets have gone up a little. This time I was in Barcelona for less than one day.

I was originally going to take the cable car up the mountain from the Tibidabo metro station, but when I saw the path leading up, I decided I had to take on the challenge.

This path is called the "road of the eagles", where people run cross-country and ride bicycles.

By taking a shortcut, you can climb to the second level of the road or to the very top, however, everything is visible from the first level. On the second level there is a road, which at some point turns into a dead end, where the “Law Academy” is located.

And now some advice on how to climb the mountain faster. The path to the top begins next to the funicular. If you follow it straight, it will go to the top, going around the entire mountain. But there is also a short, but very inconspicuous path. Not far from the beginning there is such a building, from which comes the barking of a huge number of disgusting mongrels, it is difficult to miss.

<p>
If you turn behind the low wall before this building, you will find a path going up, then turning into a staircase. Having walked along it, you can quickly get to the upper station of the funicular.

In the center, as usual, there is pandemonium.

This time I paid attention to the signs with street names. I didn’t remember them last time because they weren’t particularly expressive.
