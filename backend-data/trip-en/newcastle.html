<h1>United Kingdom: Newcastle, York, Newark</h1>
<i>9-12 October 2019</i>
<h2>Newcastle</h2>
<p>
Newcastle is a large industrial city, the capital of northern England (Northumberland). Officially called Newcastle upon Tyne, to avoid confusion with another city, Newcastle-under-Lyme.

As usual, there is a large pedestrian street in the center.

In the foreground is a rare example of a turning bridge, which is made parallel to the current when it is necessary to let a ship pass.

<p>
Even more interesting is the white pedestrian bridge in the distance - to allow ships to pass, it rotates 45 degrees around its axis, thereby making the upper arch and the span of the bridge symmetrical and both at 45 degrees to the water.

Newcastle is one of only three cities in the UK with a metro system.

And the only one where the metro was not built in the 19th century.

<h2>Hexham</h2>
<p>
Near Newcastle was Hadrian's Wall, a wall that the Romans built across northern England to protect themselves from Scottish raids. Of course, this is the prototype of the Wall in Game of Thrones. The wall ran through what is now the center of Newcastle, but nothing of it survives there. The problem was that all the sites were somewhere in the countryside, and the bus specially for tourists along the wall stopped running at the end of September. Not a single railway station is located closer than 5-6 kilometers from the wall. In the end, I decided to visit the small town of Heddon (Heddon on the Wall) very close to Newcastle, which can be reached by commuter bus. Heddon is a real English village.

In reality, the wall was about three meters wide and 5-6 meters high, much less than in the series.

The facade of the cathedral faces the cliff and the river; you can only see it from afar from the other bank, since the entrance is on the side. And here is the back part, where the altar is.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256744708_8b1b2f4994_o.jpg">
<p>
The cathedral was built at the end of the 11th century, it is one of the earliest examples of Gothic architecture, so from the outside it is not quite typically Gothic. There were more later changes inside, so the inside is very gothic.

<h2>York</h2>
<p>
After Newcastle, the last stop was York - an ancient city in the northeast of England (Yorkshire and Humber region). The much more famous city <a href="../new-york">New York</a> is named after York.

<h2>Newark</h2>
<p>
Due to pricing, it was cheaper to break up a trip from York to London with a stop in the middle in Newark-on-Trent. The much larger American Newark, a suburb of New York, is named after this city. This is the East Midlands region, there are no particularly large cities here. Not far from Newark is Sherwood Forest, where, according to legend, Robin Hood lived.
The train station here is small, but with a nice wooden decoration on the platform canopy and a clock.
