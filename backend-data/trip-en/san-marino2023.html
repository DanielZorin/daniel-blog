<h2>San Marino</h2>
<p>
San Marino is the last of the European microstates that I haven’t written about since I was there back in 2009 and the battery on my camera died. San Marino is surrounded on all sides by Italian territory, and the only public transport to get there is the bus to the nearest large city of Rimini, which runs quite rarely, once every 1.5-2 hours. The fare is 6 euros one way. San Marino is located on top of a fairly steep cliff called Monte Titano, which made the city impregnable in the Middle Ages. In the 15th century they successfully allied with the Papal States against the Duchy of Rimini, giving San Marino the modern territories around Monte Titano. Later, the Papal State tried to capture San Marino several times, but failed. In the 19th century, first Napoleon and then Garibaldi maintained the independence of San Marino out of respect for the fact that it is the oldest state with a republican form of government.

First, the bus enters an industrial area in the north of San Marino, then returns to Italy for a short time. Yes, there is industry in San Marino.

The remote areas of San Marino are not of particular interest to tourists.

<p>
Some people seem to go there for shopping because taxes are lower than in Italy.

I got off the bus in the town of Borgo Maggiore, just before the capital.
<p/>

The capital is on top of this rock.

<p>
Borgo Maggiore has a bit of a historical center.

And the clothing market is like in Turkey.

<p>
From Borgo Maggiore you can go up to the city of San Marino on this cable car for 3 euros.

<p>
After riding on the cable car, I found myself almost at the very top of the city of San Marino, and explored it from top to bottom. If you arrive by bus, the path will be the opposite from bottom to top.

Streets of San Marino. They almost all go uphill or downhill.

On the ridge of the rock there is a fortress wall (apparently purely symbolic, it is unlikely that anyone could storm from that side) and three watchtowers depicted on the flag and coat of arms: Guaita, Cesta and Montale.

Somewhere here the wall goes down, marking the center of the city.

In the distance you can see the third tower, where few tourists reach.

Moreover, I didn’t immediately find the entrance itself. It requires a ladder.

Next to the Montale Tower there is a large building - the office of San Marino Television.

On the descent from San Marino you can see a carriage standing near the tunnel. Now San Marino is one of two countries in Europe without railways (the other one is <a href="../andorra">Andorra</a>), but once upon a time there was a railway, and it reached right up to the capital at the top, which was very impressive at that time. The road was built in 1932, but it was destroyed during the Second World War.
