<h1>Ukraine: Kyiv</h1>
<i>17-18 March 2014</i>
<h2>Kyiv</h2>
<p>
It's not every day that you witness important historical events. In Russia, nothing epoch-making has happened since 1993. So I can be proud that, at least for a little, I saw Kyiv immediately after the revolution, in an era of change. On that day, Crimea declared independence, but was not yet officially annexed into Russia.

After the overthrow of Yanukovych, the situation in Kyiv was no longer covered live in as much detail as possible; Russian news was limited to unsubstantiated allegations about the “gangster tyranny of Bandera’s followers” and “fascist aggression.” In reality, now the main confrontation has shifted to the east; in Kyiv, nothing much is happening on the streets, but the Maidan is still standing. The main part of the city is fenced off with barricades, so one might get the impression that there are not many people on the other streets in the evening, although this is not directly related to the Maidan. Here, for example, is the place where the monument to Lenin used to stand.

Not far from the beginning of Khreshchatyk there is the first barricade, one of the largest, near which there is still a small passage on the side.

There are plenty of tires.

<p>
All exits to Khreshchatyk, including through the arches, were blocked; now these barricades look thinner.

Closer to the edge, the tiles on Khreshchatyk are being re-laid.

<p>
Now the barricades have become a landmark of Kyiv, where else can you see something like this? People are taking pictures.

Near the presidential administration too.

On the Maidan itself, tents are densely packed, self-defense activists are lighting stoves and discussing the latest news. Some stores on the Maidan are closed; for example, McDonald’s is now a center for psychological assistance on the Maidan. There is also a desk where you can enroll in the ranks of self-defense or the Right Sector.

Maidan guards wear khaki. Outside the Maidan, they can only be found near government buildings.

Actually Maidan. Please note that some of the posters are in Russian.

In general, in Kyiv, most people speak Russian, on the Maidan the percentage is lower, since there are also visitors from the western regions, but in general, many people communicate in Russian. No one is forced to jump for this.

The names of cities are written on the tents, there is even Sevastopol. I couldn’t find any portraits of Bandera anywhere. Probably Kiselev hung it there himself, filmed the story, and then removed it.

Someone is performing on stage. It looks like now this is a platform where almost anyone can go. About 50 people are listening. The speaker talked about the need to keep the authorities in check and prevent them from turning into another corrupt junta. "Glory to Ukraine!" and “Shame!” - they shouted.

In general, the demands on the Maidan are very reasonable.

They have not yet had time to remove the old stickers demanding the resignation of Yanukovych.

The walls of the Maidan are covered with a thick layer of inscriptions in small print.

Going ahead. The monument to the lanterns on the Maidan has not gone away, only the lanterns have changed.

A burnt-out trade union building, the smell of burning still emanates from it.

A popular slogan today on a huge poster: "United country" in both Ukrainian and Russian language. The same ones can be seen in the subway on escalators.

Grushevsky Street, where the fighting took place in January, has now become a car street again. Hedgehogs stand as a reminder.

What can I say. To gain a foothold, the Ukrainian government needs to get down to pressing matters. In fact, their rather sluggish reaction (not counting the statements of ultranationalists) to the annexation of Crimea and the general background of the agenda on the Maidan create the impression that they themselves also understand that it is better to lose one Crimea (in which there were not many Ukrainian patriots anyway) than half the country . The loss of Crimea in some ways even benefits them, because now there is one less subsidized region in Ukraine, and two million voters who voted for Yanukovych have disappeared, it will be easier to win elections. I hope that this whole situation will ultimately benefit Ukraine in terms of uniting the people and building a civilized state.
In Russia, it is unlikely that anything will change in the next 1000 years. Only now we will have two more regions and some less money in our pockets.
