<h2>Bahrain</h2>
<p>
Bahrain is the smallest country in the Persian Gulf. It consists of two relatively large islands, not counting small, almost uninhabited ones. Bahrain is more liberal than its neighbors (for example, alcohol is widely available here), and was the first one to take the path of economic diversification, as due to its size it has the least amount of oil. For some reason, the southern half of the main island is practically undeveloped, all cities including the capital Manama are on the northern coast.

<p>
I stayed near the center of the capital (the hotel cost about $35 and was quite good, cheaper than I expected to pay in this expensive region), and on the first evening I walked around the area a little.

Behind this fence is the palace of king Hamad II. He restyled himself from emir to king in 2002.

On the northern edge of Manama there are all sorts of skyscrapers along the seashore. The most eye-catching one are these two triangular towers, between which windmills spin.

Bahrain has a fairly convenient bus system, one ride costs 300 fils (about $0.8), there are many routes, and they run regularly, at intervals of 15-20 minutes, even on weekends. I went a couple of kilometers to the edge of Manama.

Despite its small area, Bahrain has three UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The first one I visited was the Qalat al-Bahrain fortress.

<p>
The fortress is impressive. The walls were built by Portuguese colonists, but even before them there was a fort on this site, since ancient times, when the Dilmun civilization existed on the territory of Bahrain (3rd millennium BC).

The second World Heritage Site is the Dilmun Mounds themselves, which are scattered throughout the island. To the south of the fortress there is a large wasteland, which also seems to have burial mounds, although it does not appear on the official list.

The third interesting place is the historical city of Muharraq, located on the second, smaller island east of the main one, where Manama is. The airport is on this island too.

Muharraq has a number of historical buildings from the era when pearl fishing was the main industry in Bahrain. Pearls are still found here today.
