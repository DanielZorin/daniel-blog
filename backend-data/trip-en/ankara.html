<h1>Turkey: Ankara, Konya, Safranbolu</h1>
<i>20-24 December 2021</i>
<h2>Ankara</h2>
<p>
Ankara became the capital of Turkey after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire as a result of the First World War. This provincial city was where the National Assembly was convened and Atatürk's headquarters were located during the War of Independence, as Istanbul/Constantinople was occupied. As a result of the capital move, Ankara began to grow and is now the second largest city in the country with a population of over 5 million. Most of the city was built in the 20th century. Conventionally, the railway divides the center into two parts, to the north is the old part of Ankara, and to the south is the new part, where government buildings are located. This part is built in a grid along the wings, similar to the capital of <a href="../brasilia">Brazil</a>. In the middle there is Kizilay Square and the metro station of the same name, where several lines intersect. The area looks like this.

<p>
Reminds me of Japan, especially these signs on every floor of the building.

<p>
Pharmacy. In Turkish, it's called Eczane, and doesn't use familiar symbols in the form of a cross or a bowl with a snake, so at first it seems that there are no pharmacies anywhere.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51783485341_1f8f258381_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A pharmacy in Turkey is indicated by the letter E in a square, as on this sign.

<p>
My favorite Turkish dish is Adana kebab. In Ankara it is very easy to eat well for pennies; this dish cost three dollars, with a bunch of additional snacks.
<p/>

Breakfast in the hotel. Hotels here are also very cheap.
<p/>

<p>
Metro. It’s good that you can buy tickets for one trip here, unlike most cities in Turkey.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51783485256_5ca9d4358e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
All metro lines are named by numbers M1, M2, etc., and one is called by the letter A, from Ankaray. This is the very first line with slightly different carriages.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51783485206_22532d40bb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The central station is busy, but the others can be quite empty.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51783502961_3c7384c065_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is a government area.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51783502931_d054fb1dc5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Nearby are residential areas with four-story buildings.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51784132489_7d993e0b4c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here you can see Ataturk's mausoleum nearby.
<p/>

<p>
Just got to the changing of the guard, the soldiers here walk as funny as in <a href="../greece">Athens</a>.

<p>
It turned out that I entered from the side entrance, and from the central one there is an epic alley, although the walk from the metro takes longer.
<p/>

<p>
In addition to the metro, Ankara also has a cable car, which is used as public transport to access areas on the hill. I wanted to take a ride on it, but it turned out that it was closed, you will laugh, because of the coronavirus (like there is no way to maintain distance in the booth).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51784374385_bc2a1194f7_h.jpg"/>

Ankara bus station.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51782686602_f560b3178d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The railway station is colossal in size.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51783737103_66807293dd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The station resembles China, not only in size, but also in layout - the tracks on the ground floor, access to them by escalator, and tickets are checked before entering the platform (at the entrance to the station only QR codes are looked at).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51783737123_4272d7a311_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are not many trains here - about 8 times a day to Istanbul and 4 times a day to Konya.

North of the station begins the old center, as well as a large park.

<p>
If it weren't for the Ataturk monument, I would not have guessed that this was the central square.

<p>
I came here to look at the ruins of an ancient Roman temple, which, unexpectedly, are also in Ankara.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51784375950_00d67cc8ac_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But it turned out that an “antique” area was built here from scratch.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51783755103_7bab0a6601_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It is terribly reminiscent of China, except there are Chinese houses with curved roofs, and here they are like Ottoman ones.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51783755063_2ad52ef138_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Souvenir shops are already here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51783504141_184f81a7e7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Even the transformer was designed correctly.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51783755003_44ec54ad54_h.jpg"/>
<p>
From here you can see the neighboring hills, on which you can see houses for demolition and empty spaces from already demolished houses.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51784375910_634087f3cd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a fortress on the largest hill - this is the oldest part of Ankara.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51783504106_6b378cc8a8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At the foot of the fortress there is a Roman theater that looks like this. I almost choked on such an epic restoration.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51783754928_13e591745e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
From here you can clearly see the panorama of the new "antique" area.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51784375815_72c2d83fe2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Well, we go inside the fortress.

<p>
Ankara was very impressive even for a seasoned traveler like me. It is interesting because it has not only beautiful views from the top of the fortress (there are many similar places), but also an incredible mixture of eras, when you can see how the city is changing right now. 5 years will pass, maximum 10, and I will no longer recognize Ankara, because it will be almost completely rebuilt.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51783503731_ea76632ce6_h.jpg"/>

<p>
I enter the fortress from the side entrance, immediately getting almost to the very top.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51784375725_ffb70fb96c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
What's going on here? Some house is being renovated, tiles are lying, asphalt/tiles have been removed from the road.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51784133549_9bb384b61b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Yes, it looks like an old city, but there is no one there and half the houses are clearly abandoned.
<p/>

<p>
But some of them have decent doors, and in some places I even noticed people.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51784133484_4459eff920_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I go lower, and oops, and here everything is already built properly.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51784133459_d8c0c80094_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Though, people haven’t really had time to move in yet.

This is what the result should look like.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51783503981_8955ff4d31_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You can climb the tower of the fortress wall, where there are even a few tourists. New houses are in the foreground, the citadel is in the distance.

<p>
It’s interesting here, on some hills the old neighborhoods have already been demolished and typical Turkish high-rise buildings have been built.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51784375500_bcd617c735_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And at the foot of the fortress they have not yet had time to demolish it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51782687832_90d04301cc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are houses here and there that are attached to the fortress wall, as they used to do in all European cities to save on the construction of one wall. Now almost all the fortresses have been museumized, and similar favelas have long been demolished.
<p/>

It can be seen that the houses are “antique” for a reason with a sort of half-timbered structure without diagonals.

<h2>Konya</h2>
<p>
Konya is a historical city in central Turkey. You can easily get there from Ankara by high-speed train in less than two hours.

<p/>

<p>
The weather was a little abnormal, it even made into the Turkish news that snow covered Konya. The fountains work, because they usually don’t turn them off during the winter.

To the east of the hill is the central part of Konya. Guidebooks like wikivoyage indicated that there should be some kind of historical buildings there, but in general I didn’t really know what to expect, since there was little information.
<p/>

This is a very old mosque, from the 12th century. Apparently, they built it simply back then, without domes.

Having reached the end of the street, I found myself in the main square. Konya - the city of hearts. On the right is the main mosque.
<p/>

This is the mausoleum of Rumi (also known as Mevlana), the founder of the Dervish order.

Dervishes are monks who need to observe asceticism and not have any property. Turkish dervishes are known for achieving religious ecstasy through whirling dances while wearing a white dress. Under Ataturk, the dervish orders were banned, and now these dances are officially shown as a cultural performance, although there seem to be actual practitioners (not publicly).

Entering the mausoleum wearing shoe covers (a rarity in Turkey, where everyone usually just takes off their shoes at the entrance to the mosque). In Turkish, shoe covers are called galoshes, like in Russian.
<p/>

<p>
The guidebook correctly states that the area opposite the mausoleum has been demolished and is being rebuilt. Judging by the posters there will be something like an elite residential complex.

There are still a couple of buildings behind the façade, from which you can imagine what Konya looked like before.

<h2>Safranbolu</h2>
<p>
Safranbolu is the only small town in Turkey listed as a World Heritage Site for its well-preserved historical center. In almost all cities, historical buildings have not been preserved due to very strong urbanization in the 20th century, which continues today. I have already showed the rebuilding of historical quarters in Ankara, and now you can see what the original actually looked like.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51783486066_e1b5df8f4c_h.jpg"/>

<p>
Safranbolu is a three-hour drive north from Ankara. There are no other famous tourist cities closer, it takes 7 hours to get to Istanbul, so there are practically no foreign tourists.

First, the bus stops at the neighboring larger city, the regional center of Karabuk.
