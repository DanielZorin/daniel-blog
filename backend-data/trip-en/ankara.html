<h1>Turkey: Ankara, Konya, Safranbolu</h1>
<i>20-24 December 2021</i>
<h2>Ankara</h2>
<p>
Ankara became the capital of Turkey after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire as a result of the First World War. This provincial city was where the National Assembly was convened and Atatürk's headquarters were located during the War of Independence, as Istanbul/Constantinople was occupied. As a result of the capital move, Ankara began to grow and is now the second largest city in the country with a population of over 5 million. Most of the city was built in the 20th century. Conventionally, the railway divides the center into two parts, to the north is the old part of Ankara, and to the south is the new part, where government buildings are located. This part is built in a grid along the wings, similar to the capital of <a href="../brasilia">Brazil</a>. In the middle there is Kizilay Square and the metro station of the same name, where several lines intersect. The area looks like this.

<p>
Reminds me of Japan, especially these signs on every floor of the building.

Pharmacy. In Turkish, it's called Eczane, and doesn't use familiar symbols in the form of a cross or a bowl with a snake, so at first it seems that there are no pharmacies anywhere.
<p/>

A pharmacy in Turkey is indicated by the letter E in a square, as on this sign.

My favorite Turkish dish is Adana kebab. In Ankara it is very easy to eat well for pennies; this dish cost three dollars, with a bunch of additional snacks.

Metro. It’s good that you can buy tickets for one trip here, unlike most cities in Turkey.
<p/>

<p>
All metro lines are named by numbers M1, M2, etc., and one is called by the letter A, from Ankaray. This is the very first line with slightly different carriages.

The central station is busy, but the others can be quite empty.

It turned out that I entered from the side entrance, and from the central one there is an epic alley, although the walk from the metro takes longer.

<p>
In addition to the metro, Ankara also has a cable car, which is used as public transport to access areas on the hill. I wanted to take a ride on it, but it turned out that it was closed, you will laugh, because of the coronavirus (like there is no way to maintain distance in the booth).

The railway station is colossal in size.

<p>
The station resembles China, not only in size, but also in layout - the tracks on the ground floor, access to them by escalator, and tickets are checked before entering the platform (at the entrance to the station only QR codes are looked at).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51783737123_37f8e708bc_o.jpg">

There are not many trains here - about 8 times a day to Istanbul and 4 times a day to Konya.

It is terribly reminiscent of China, except there are Chinese houses with curved roofs, and here they are like Ottoman ones.

There is a fortress on the largest hill - this is the oldest part of Ankara.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51783504106_8651312ece_o.jpg">
<p>
At the foot of the fortress there is a Roman theater that looks like this. I almost choked on such an epic restoration.
<p/>

From here you can clearly see the panorama of the new "antique" area.

Ankara was very impressive even for a seasoned traveler like me. It is interesting because it has not only beautiful views from the top of the fortress (there are many similar places), but also an incredible mixture of eras, when you can see how the city is changing right now. 5 years will pass, maximum 10, and I will no longer recognize Ankara, because it will be almost completely rebuilt.
<p/>

What's going on here? Some house is being renovated, tiles are lying, asphalt/tiles have been removed from the road.

Yes, it looks like an old city, but there is no one there and half the houses are clearly abandoned.

<p>
There are houses here and there that are attached to the fortress wall, as they used to do in all European cities to save on the construction of one wall. Now almost all the fortresses have been museumized, and similar favelas have long been demolished.

To the east of the hill is the central part of Konya. Guidebooks like wikivoyage indicated that there should be some kind of historical buildings there, but in general I didn’t really know what to expect, since there was little information.

Dervishes are monks who need to observe asceticism and not have any property. Turkish dervishes are known for achieving religious ecstasy through whirling dances while wearing a white dress. Under Ataturk, the dervish orders were banned, and now these dances are officially shown as a cultural performance, although there seem to be actual practitioners (not publicly).

The guidebook correctly states that the area opposite the mausoleum has been demolished and is being rebuilt. Judging by the posters there will be something like an elite residential complex.

<h2>Safranbolu</h2>
<p>
Safranbolu is the only small town in Turkey listed as a World Heritage Site for its well-preserved historical center. In almost all cities, historical buildings have not been preserved due to very strong urbanization in the 20th century, which continues today. I have already showed the rebuilding of historical quarters in Ankara, and now you can see what the original actually looked like.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51783486066_d125bb5aea_o.jpg">

<p>
Safranbolu is a three-hour drive north from Ankara. There are no other famous tourist cities closer, it takes 7 hours to get to Istanbul, so there are practically no foreign tourists.
