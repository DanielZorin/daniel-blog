<h1>Austria: Braunau am Inn, Salzburg, Feldkirch</h1>
<i>29 June, 4, 7-8 July 2013</i>
<h2>Braunau am Inn</h2>
<p>
This sleepy little town of 16 thousand is located right on the German border. From Germany to Austria you can cross the bridge over the Inn River.

<p>
Braunau am Inn is famous mainly for the fact that Adolf Hitler was born here. This is the street, this is the house.

Rear view of the house. There was a hotel in the house. In those days, there were almost no short tourist trips; people often lived in hotels for years, as they do now in rented apartments. Hitler's father lived there for several years when he worked at Austrian customs on this section of the border.

<p>
The city is trying with all its might to wash itself away from such an “honorable” fellow countryman, no excursions related to Hitler are conducted, and this person is practically not mentioned in advertising brochures. Near the house there is a memorial plaque “in memory of the victims of fascism.”

<p>
Apart from its symbolic significance, the town is not particularly noteworthy and is similar to many other small towns in Germany and Austria.

Even Russians live here. I was very surprised when I heard a woman and a little girl entering the house speaking Russian.

<h2>Salzburg</h2>
<p>
When you visit a large number of cities in Europe, they cease to impress as much as the first time. I now often stop by somewhere just to break up a three-hour train ride in half, or to look at one particular place. At the same time, I will say that Salzburg is definitely worth a trip, as it is one of the most picturesque cities in central Europe.

It is worth going here primarily to climb to the top of the castle.

The city center is very small, just two streets sandwiched between a river and a cliff.

I always wondered what the toilets looked like in royal palaces. Usually they are not included in the exhibition accessible to tourists, but not here. You can also see this in the Summer Palace in St. Petersburg, which, however, is now closed.
