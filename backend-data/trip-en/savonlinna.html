<h1>Finland: Savonlinna, Imatra</h1>
<i>1 October 2016</i>
<h2>Imatra</h2>
<p>
Many residents of St. Petersburg go shopping to Finland. One of the motivations is the need to “properly use” a visa from the Finnish consulate. You can also buy a lot of goods there that have not been sold in Russia since 2014. Typically, shopping tours go to the cities of Lappeenranta and Imatra, which are closest to the border. It's a little closer to Lappeenranta, but Imatra has a little less queue at the border on weekends. Bus tours depart from St. Petersburg daily for about 700 rubles per person. To make it more than just shopping, I chose a one-day tour to the historical city of Savonlinna for 1,300 rubles. This is by far the cheapest way to get to this city, because the road from Helsinki at Finnish railway rates will be several times more expensive. Before Savonlinna there was also a stop at a store near the border. There, right next to the border terminal, there are three shops in an open field, but two of them were closed: although they sell sanctioned cheese, prices converteed to rubles doubled in 2014, and now buying food in Finland is significantly more expensive than in Russia.

Here it is - cheese! This is the famous Finnish Oltermanni cheese, it is apparently inexpensive - only 6 euros per kilogram.

The notorious Parmesan starts from 6 euros per 200 grams, however, it is not much cheaper in Italy either.

Previously, people here bought household chemicals, but now there is no point - anyway, these detergents are not much different from each other, and one bottle lasts for a couple of months.

It vaguely resembles a Russian province in architecture; after all, Finland was part of the Russian Empire throughout the 19th century.

Finland is very picturesque, especially if you drive from the main highway to the north, where numerous lakes begin.
