<h1>Botswana: Francistown, Gaborone</h1>
<i>5-6 February 2023</i>
<h2>Francistown</h2>
<p>
After walking across the border, I ended up in Botswana, which is considered one of the richest and safest countries in Africa. No man's land between Zimbabwe and Botswana:

<p>
There are a couple of supermarkets right after the border.
<p/>

<p>
I took a minibus to the nearest town of Francistown. In Southern Africa, luggage is often carried in trailers behind the bus or minibus.

<p>
The landscape of Botswana is approximately a flat savannah.

Once we were all taken off the minibus and through a “sanitary control”.

To be honest, I’m not sure that stepping on this wet rag will reliably disinfect the shoes.

<p>
There are a couple of hills closer to Francistown.

<p>
Bus station. Francistown is the second largest city in Botswana and a transport hub, so there are plenty of buses.
<p/>

<p>
Next to the bus station there is a large shopping center with a bunch of familiar brands, it looks respectable.

Prices at the local Hungry Lion. To get dollars, you have to divide by 14. Inexpensive.

Basically, the entire city center consists of shops, which is typical for Africa.

It was starting to get dark, I was ready to relax and wait another three hours till Gaborone. Suddenly the bus stopped in the middle of the road. Passengers began to get out and see what happened there. Something happened to the engine. The driver shook his head, and after that the passengers lined up in front of the conductor, who began to return the fare money to everyone.
<p/>

<p>
And then all 60-70 passengers from the bus began to hitchhike. Cars stopped quite often, as locals often give rides for money. But still, I have never had such great competition in hitchhiking.
<p/>

<p>
I walked 100 meters to a bar that stood in splendid isolation in the middle of this highway, drank a can of cola there, and took a chill. And then soon the car to Gaborone picked me up.

<h2>Gaborone</h2>
<p>
Gaborone is the capital of Botswana. The city was built in the 1960s almost from scratch, so it is a bit reminiscent of other regular cities of that time. But compared to the capitals of Brazil and Pakistan, the avenues here are not so wide, and there are no large squares of residential areas. Rather, the circular layout resembles the capital of <a href="../sydney">Australia</a>.

<p>
In the center of Gaborone, streets diverge from the parliament building in a semicircle to the east. To the west of the center there is a railway, followed by a bus station and the new Central Business district. The rest of the city is ordinary American-style residential areas (with streets purely for cars, where you have to walk in circles). Bus station:

There is a large hotel right at the bus station, convenient. This is also one of the cheapest hotels in the city.
