<h1>Russia: Ufa, Kurgan, Chelyabinsk</h1>
<i>19-22 January 2019</i>
<h2>Ufa</h2>
<p>
Ufa and Kazan have a lot in common - both are over a million people, capitals of national republics, quite rich; What Ufa doesn’t have is a Kremlin and a full-fledged historical center, so tourists come here much less. The only famous attraction here is the huge equestrian monument to Salavat Yulaev (a participant in the peasant war of Emelyan Pugachev).
<p/>

<p>
Ufa stands on a high, steep bank of the Belaya River.

<p>
The historical center has practically not been preserved.
<p/>

<p>
Forlornly behind a fence, surrounded by high-rise buildings, stands the house-museum where Lenin once lived.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254939802_6024b80222_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The monument to Lenin in the center is unusual - Lenin sits with his elbows on his knees, and behind him is a stele with a globe on top.
<p/>

<p>
This is not the main monument to Lenin in Ufa, because here, unusually, the historical and Soviet administrative center do not coincide. A few kilometers to the north there is a huge square where the city hall and a giant Lenin stand.

In the Bashkir language, the name of the city of Ufa is symmetrical both horizontally and vertically.

There is probably a monument to a policeman in every Russian city, like a monument to Lenin.

<h2>Kurgan</h2>
<p>
Kurgan is perhaps the most inconspicuous regional center in the Urals. People of the older generation may remember Dr. Ilizarov, the inventor of the apparatus of the same name for the treatment of fractures, who worked in this city. Otherwise, Kurgan is in the shadow of the neighboring Ural regions, which are all over million people - Ufa, Chelyabinsk, Yekaterinburg, Perm. However, the city turned out to be more beautiful and interesting than many of its neighbors.

<h2>Chelyabinsk</h2>
<p>
Chelyabinsk is an industrial city in the Urals, known mainly for memes about the "harsh Chelyabinsk X" and the meteorite. The most interesting thing about Chelyabinsk is its coat of arms, which depicts a camel.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257052250_d9c031f744_h.jpg"/>

<p>
As in other Russian cities, there is one pedestrian street in the center.

<p>
As soon as the pedestrian street ends, the pedestrian runs into a multi-lane highway, also known as the central square. You can only get to the other side through an underground passage.
<p/>
