<h1>Russia: Tomsk, Kemerovo</h1>
<i>14-15 December 2018</i>
<h2>Tomsk</h2>
<p>
With the opening of new Pobeda destinations, I was able to fly all the way to Siberia for the weekend and see a couple of previously unvisited regions. The first was Tomsk - one of the oldest cities in the region.

<p>
The airport here is small and not very new.

<p>
In addition to flights to Moscow, there are charters to Thailand.

<p>
The weather was just right - frost -15 and mountains of snow on the streets. You won’t see such a real Russian winter in Moscow.

Tomsk is one of ~40 historical cities in Russia, and for good reason.
<p/>

The center is very solid and beautiful.

<p>
The main Lenin here is surprisingly modest, standing at some kind of roundabout, of small stature.

This is where the legendary monument to the ruble stands (originally it stood on one of the city squares). Post-ironic: a monument to rouble which is often nicknamed "wood" is wooden.

Siberia has its own chain of stores. Of the ones we are used to, there is usually only “Magnit”, but in Tomsk “Brighter!” is more common. And "Maria-Ra".

<h2>Kemerovo</h2>
<p>
Kemerovo is the capital of the Kemerovo region, also known as Kuzbass. Coal is mined here, but since coal is not in price now, the region is not particularly rich.
<p/>

The city recently gained notoriety due to a terrible fire in a shopping center.
