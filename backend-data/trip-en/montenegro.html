<h1>Montenegro: Budva</h1>
<i>1 July 2014</i>
<h2>Budva</h2>
<p>
I have already been to Montenegro 10 years ago (at that time it was one country with <a href="../serbia">Serbia</a>). In three weeks I saw most of the sights, so this time I decided to transit through it, looking at some familiar places in passing. Ten years ago, Montenegro was a nice, quiet place to relax, but now the country has degraded so much that it has turned into a second <a href="../cyprus">Cyprus</a>. Or even worse, because in Cyprus I still don’t remember advertising posters along the highways that are not in the state language.

I have nothing against Russian tourists as such, including package ones. I'm sure there aren't many signs in Spanish anywhere in Cancun either. There are only two significant reasons why I don't like crowds. Firstly, the uniqueness of the place is lost, it ceases to be any different from Sharm el-Sheikh, Antalya and other dozens of identical resorts. Secondly, prices are rising significantly. In my opinion, the more expensive the place, the less suitable it is for <i>vacation</i>. To see <a href="../rio-de-janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>, you can pay 30-40 thousand for a ticket, but what’s the point of overpaying for what you can get on the beach in Turkey or Crimea?

Russian-language advertising is mainly aimed at the VIP category.

How can you get a mortgage in Montenegro? I can not understand. Firstly, in my opinion, houses in Montenegro are bought by the wrong people who can barely make ends meet and are drowning in loans. Secondly, this is a huge risk, because in fact this is a huge loan in foreign currency, the exchange rate of which to the ruble can change dramatically.

In a few hours I drove along the entire coast through most of the familiar places.

Perast is probably the most beautiful city in Montenegro.

Kotor. Now cruise ships dock here.

Bridges and tunnels in Montenegro are decorated in interesting ways. The length is written on the plate, as in physics problems.

There was time to walk around Budva, a miniature city, the old part of which can be crossed in 15 minutes. Unlike Dubrovnik, here all the shutters are open.

Obituaries. All are written in Cyrillic, although most of the signs in Montenegro are in Latin. After independence, the local language began to be called Montenegrin.

The beach is near the old town, full of people like in Crimea.

And there are Russian advertisements everywhere.

There are more inscriptions in Russian than in Serbian.

In general, if you want to relax on the beach, go to Anapa or Turkey, everything is the same, but cheaper.
