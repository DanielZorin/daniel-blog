<h1>Belarus: Grodno, Polotsk, Vitebsk</h1>
<i>12-17 August 2016</i>
<h2>Grodno</h2>
<p>
Grodno is a city on the western border of Belarus; it seems to have the most nationalists (here they are called “zmagars”), but in absolute numbers there are still very few. Externally, this city is most similar to neighboring Lithuania, with which Belarus has a lot of common history as part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

I rented an apartment for daily rent on the outskirts of Grodno. A large two-room apartment costs less than $20 a day, which in Belarus is often much cheaper than a hotel.

<h2>Polotsk</h2>
<p>
Polotsk is the most ancient city in Belarus, and the oldest building in the country is located here. Though, in the 11th century it looked completely different, and in its current form it was rebuilt in the 18th century.
<p/>

<p>
There is also a second ancient church from the 12th century, with preserved frescoes. This is the small church on the right, while the large church on the left is from the late 19th century.

Lukashenko likes to remind that the geographical center of Europe is located in Belarus, although people outside the western borders do not know about this.
