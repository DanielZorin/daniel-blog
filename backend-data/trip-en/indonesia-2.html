<h1>Indonesia: Yogyakarta, Surakarta, Bandung</h1>
<i>26 November - 3 December 2011</i>
<h2>Yogyakarta</h2>
<p>
Yogyakarta is the most touristic city on Java. Here in the city center you can sometimes meet Europeans, and the population knows the standard scams involving luring them into various stores. In addition, this is a city with an ancient history, which for a long time was the capital of an independent state, and is now the center of the autonomous region of the same name within Indonesia.
Unlike Jakarta, here you can walk along the streets, which, in fact, will be discussed further.
</p>

<p>
Yogyakarta is much neater than Jakarta. The sidewalks are paved with tiles that do not fall apart before your eyes.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257248855_c2629d27de_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In some places there are even traffic lights that count down the time, and they are not even ignored.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256405383_3a67cff55d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a palace in the city where the Sultan still lives, even if he has no real power. Around the palace there is a vast area with beautiful houses, surrounded by white stone walls.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256405408_163cd1a340_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Historically, close associates of the Sultan used to live there, but now it's just wealthy people. There is no crazy traffic flow here and there is real silence.
</p>

<p>
Typical fence.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256206701_5aba56874a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
An atypical fence and a sudden statue.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255476352_5fc4c2f3aa_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The lanes, as in Jakarta, are narrow, but do not sparkle with desperate poverty; on the contrary, everything is very civilized.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256954564_34d5d81593_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A bit reminiscent of courtyards in southern Europe.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256954664_b634779bc8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The most magnificent building in the city is the Bank of Indonesia. There is something like this in Jakarta too, but I only saw it from the bus window.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256954599_815f11f0fd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On the main street there is no crowding between the rows of merchants and passers-by.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257249090_8d6330f835_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At the entrance there is a breathtaking sculpture.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256030312_01188bf9fd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Even the channels are not very dirty.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256954759_6be7d2aac6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
As for public transport, everything here is also very diverse. There are no bajajs, but since the traffic is not so busy, pedicabs are used. There are also buses on dedicated lanes, horse-drawn transport for tourists and taxis. A taxi is the most convenient, but you can’t always catch one. You have to bargain desperately with a rickshaw driver, and they only agree to prices comparable to the price of a taxi ride.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255476602_ce0295e730_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Local aristocrats do not disdain bicycles with three working and one passenger seats.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257248920_540e9e87fc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The graffiti culture has also reached Yogyakarta.
</p>

<p>
In Jakarta, most people's native language is Indonesian, a very simple language - the lingua franca of Indonesia. The provinces have their own languages, in particular Javanese. Javanese has its own script, which is used to duplicate many street signs.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256405688_2e0d65cc6c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The easiest way to guess about the city's great imperial past is by looking at the majestic lanterns.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257504164_992e3221a3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And at the most beautiful pillar pedestals in Indonesia.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256954729_23f6a71a37_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Fabulous.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255476697_4fab125d5b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Before the trip, I imagined what fantastic nature and enchantingly beautiful landscapes would be in Indonesia: palm groves, mountains, volcanoes - everything that lovers of nature hikes value so much. My disappointment knew no bounds. I didn't see anything supernatural. Well, fields, well, mountains, well, forests, they all look the same. There are these in Russia too, I’ve seen them many times from the train window. Interest in natural attractions seems to have been lost.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256954364_982502d657_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Except that there are palm trees instead of birches, and strange mountains of stones.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256206471_953a584acf_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The Indonesian village lives poorly, mainly on subsistence farming. People are gradually moving to cities, although the rural population still makes up a significant percentage compared to more developed countries.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256206411_606154c8ed_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A characteristic feature of the village landscape are huge rice fields flooded with water.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256206346_6285f00126_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Compared to their size, it is striking how few people work on them, and how much work everyone has to do.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257248800_0fb43a8852_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Parangtritis</h2>
<p>
While in Yogyakarta, I couldn’t miss the opportunity to get my feet wet in the Indian Ocean, because Jakarta had the Java Sea, which is not quite the same. To get to the ocean, you need to get to the final bus stop and change to a minibus. At first it seemed that there would be no one except us, but it turned out that local residents use the minibus to travel between villages, and not to go from the city to the beach. After some time, all the seats were taken by schoolgirls on their way home from school. And then suddenly the minibus’s wheel broke. At first the driver worked magic on it for a long time, but then he finally took up the jack.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256406198_a559667687_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Passengers watch the process.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256207246_ded6264906_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It was in some rather rich village. Maybe this is not a village, but a holiday village.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255477007_c0f343ea39_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And here we are, finally, in Parangtritis. Another tropical downpour has just passed through.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256207266_e4d22e24a0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The long-awaited Indian Ocean.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256406298_f55682991f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
After the rain there were no people on the beach. Swimming, however, is not recommended in any weather, as a very strong current sucks you into the depths.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256406338_5d2ce37972_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Exposure to the Indian Ocean had a detrimental effect on the condition of my boots.
</p>
<p>
In Parangtritis, at every step, in almost every house, there are public toilets called mandi. In general, the word mandi means “to wash,” but don’t let this mislead you: kamar mandi does not mean a bath or a shower. This is a floor-level sink with a faucet above it. It is assumed that with the help of this device you can somehow wash yourself.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256406358_fd213b2d0c_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Prambanan</h2>
<p>
Prambanan is five huge Hindu temples...
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257249270_67eba9ea28_h.jpg"/>
<p>
...and many smaller temples in worse condition around.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256954849_34acc77e0f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Apparently, people prayed around the temple or on the outer terraces, because inside each temple there is only a small room, and in it there is a statue of the deity.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256030407_3a6f1665fd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Let us bow to the golden calf.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256954844_0c9c028975_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Surrounded by quiet suburbs of Yogyakarta. It turned out funny: when I took a picture of the panorama of this alley, the man sitting on the chair to the right jumped up to see what was so interesting there.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257249365_0901d9afc6_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Borobudur</h2>
<p>
Borobudur is a gigantic Buddhist temple that is actually larger than it appears in pictures. It was once lost in the jungle and filled with volcanic ash, but was found and gradually restored in the 19th century.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256955074_1ab0160edc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Now Borobudur is cared for with thin brushes.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255476872_3009d9a478_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Upon entry, everyone is given a sarong to wear. For an attraction of this scale, there are very few visitors; you can walk around absolutely freely.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256954934_112568516d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The essence of Borobudur is that at each level the walls are decorated with bas-reliefs, and if you go in the right direction, they form the entire story of the life of Buddha.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255476847_c1fe579961_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Buddha statues are placed in the corners.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256207111_68a55d286f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On the upper level there are stupas. Each stupa has the same Buddha statue as in the previous photo. For some reason, all the postcards print a photograph of the only stupa that has no roof and the Buddha statue is visible.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256207136_09ee82894a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And around the temple there are endless fields where poor locals grow rice.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256406188_a427b307f4_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Surakarta</h2>
<p>
Surakarta (abbreviated Solo) is another imperial capital. On the one hand, Solo was not destroyed several times due to volcanic eruptions, on the other hand, Borobudur and Prambanan are closer to Yogya, so the city is not spoiled by the attention of tourists. In addition, the Solo Sultanate has not retained autonomy to this day, and Solo is not even a provincial capital (the capital of Central Java is Semarang).
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256207401_8281749aaa_h.jpg"/>

<p>
As a result, you can sometimes find mountains of garbage on the streets here.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256406398_67d00926b5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Garbage is removed on an industrial scale.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257249805_fd6bc40565_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Clothes are dried directly on the street.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256207376_5591ddabd7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Foreigners become superstars, so every schoolgirl wants to take a photo with you.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257250030_e468711629_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are two Sultan's palaces in Surakarta. The fact is that once (in the mid-18th century) the sultan and the prince did not divide their spheres of influence, as a result, one half of the city remained with the prince, and the other with the sultan. It’s interesting that two hours before me, Russians were in the prince’s palace and left an entry in the guest book. To people who have been to Peterhof, this palace will not seem pompous.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255477417_972f43ff24_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Although independence is long gone, the Surakarta dynasty still exists. Their portraits are hung throughout the rooms of the palace.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256207641_6f9f4818f7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Usually the prince lives in Jakarta, but from time to time he visits his historical homeland. Part of the palace is reserved for such occasions.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256406703_bbe3931515_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The Sultan's palace is behind several rows of blank white walls. In some places the wall goes on both sides of the street, there are no houses.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257250165_3ef1812711_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This palace is also distinguished by its area, not its height.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256955724_8ff2c26ecf_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Without any jokes or sarcasm, the city is quite beautiful, there are no slums in the center and many majestic buildings.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256955324_5f61ec6ebd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Everything was done with love, from the fence to the handwritten sign.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257249870_7d75e8a745_h.jpg"/>
<p>
More beauty. Particular attention should be paid to the lantern in front of this house.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257250080_ba8a692d92_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The lanterns are simply incredible in their grace and grandeur. These are the kind of lanterns I would expect to see in Paris, not in a provincial Indonesian city.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256758711_dd780771ef_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Surakarta is the only city in Indonesia where trees grow around the canals, and in the water there is not garbage, but grass and stones.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256207456_9c72c33e60_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Another notable feature of Solo is the love for beautiful arcs.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256955739_349699cbce_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are arches near palaces...
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256406578_9ee8af3f86_h.jpg"/>
<p>
... and above the entrances to the gateways.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257504369_e1d7720fa0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
An old railway runs right through the city center. It seems that steam locomotives even run on it sometimes.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257250140_d96f567dcc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In terms of convenience, regular trains in Indonesia are approximately on the same level as Russian Railways electric trains, with the only difference being that we have fewer people. During peak hours in Jakarta, you can see crowds of people on the roof. Local trains are sometimes painted pink.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256406978_3afa0ad47a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Intercity trains do not have sleeper cars. The longest route Jakarta-Surabaya takes about 13 hours. There are also night trains, but they still have only seats. There are three classes of carriages. First class has air conditioning and in the third class you have a chance to sit on the floor. A first class ticket from Jakarta to Yogyakarta (8 hours) costs 700 rubles ($20). In third class it is 10 times less.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256206311_0630712a39_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Bandung</h2>
<p>
Welcome to Bandung, white man!
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256407818_34c8056691_h.jpg"/>

<p>
Welcome to Bandung, the city of good traffic! This one intersection has more traffic lights than the whole of Jakarta.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257250290_902abaf91c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Joke. Here, too, people mostly drive as they please, with the exception of central streets with traffic lights. You can cross the road only by maneuvering in the traffic. After a while, a slight feeling of confidence in one’s own invulnerability arises.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255478377_8eb561c0b7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Bandung is called the Paris of Java. There were no similarities, except for a couple of signs.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255478222_04ada62b8a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And a model of the Eiffel Tower.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256956369_13f1daf69f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It also doesn’t look like Holland at all, except for the name.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256208111_68377a1dd0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Not surprisingly, it doesn't look like Paris or Amsterdam. This is not an imperial capital, but a center of serious business. Everything is decorated in a harsh modern style, even the street lamps.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256758806_0fc7a1caa2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Even in the slums the houses have harsh concrete walls.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257250725_a9a777d5db_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The main feature of the city is that the shops are grouped along the streets. There is a street where they sell auto parts, a street with furniture stores, and here is a street where they sell license plates.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256407083_89fa1e6c3b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It smoothly flows into the street, where they sell rarities like typewriters.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256208061_e6a5970a7d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And here is a street with furniture shops.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256208361_1d1b452539_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The water in the canals is not stagnant, but rather turbulent. It didn't make it look any cleaner.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255477827_cf44f8c6b7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The main type of public transport is minibuses (Angkot). The streets are too narrow for buses and too busy for pedicabs (although there are some, albeit in smaller numbers). When minibuses get stuck in traffic, people with guitars get on them and start singing songs.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257250525_4c0ae25aed_h.jpg"/>
<p>
As elsewhere, the Bank of Indonesia building is striking in its luxury.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256407403_84be18baa4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In Gedung Sate (this is one of the main attractions, a building in Art Nouveau style), in one of the wings in the basement there was a museum of the Indonesian post. Inside you can take photos with local schoolchildren and look at stamps and mailboxes.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256030652_f5d036381a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And here is the Gedung Sate itself.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256407378_496ff18b4b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are a lot of interesting things on the streets. After two weeks in Indonesia, the eye became accustomed to typicalities and began to notice funny little things. For example, there is a fantastic lump of barbed wire on a pole. Apparently, there are countless treasures hidden at the top of the pillar.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255478327_ab23d2f1bf_h.jpg"/>
<p>
To protect spotlights from theft, barbed wire is not enough; you need to put the spotlight in a cage.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257250580_ea64d269a7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The street names are better than in Jakarta, but it’s impossible to navigate a little further from the highways. For example, house 44 fraction 11 point B on an unknown street.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256407628_f0225414ae_h.jpg"/>
<p>
By the way, the writing in the Sundanese language does not look like Javanese.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256208511_f39a01a14e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Restaurant. Here you can have a hearty lunch for about $2. For two.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257250595_fe5418feed_h.jpg"/>
<p>
If you don’t have enough money for a restaurant, you can use the services of a noodle brewer.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256955879_d839a3fcd1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The city has a lot of bright, daring, high-quality graffiti. One wall near the train station is worth something.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256956054_077f8131c8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is what I especially liked.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256407438_44c6ee485b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Near the Technological University. Apparently, elections of local authorities are taking place there, much more democratic than ours.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255478427_3cb0d53a35_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The apotheosis of a broken sidewalk: a collapsing staircase.
</p>
