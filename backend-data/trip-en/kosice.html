From here the bus travels to Poprad, en route passing the highest peaks of the Carpathians, called the High Tatras.

In Poprad there is a magnificent view to the north from any point.

Best enjoyed from the top platform of the train station.

<p>
This is one of the most beautiful places in Europe in terms of nature.

<p>
No worse than Switzerland.

<p>
In Slovakia, for the first time in Europe, I saw a train full. Usually, from 50 to 90 percent of the seats are free, but in Slovakia the train was almost full, some were even standing.

<h2>Kosice</h2>
<p>
At seven o'clock in the evening the center of Slovakia's second largest city looked underpopulated.

<p>
The thing is that it was Sunday.

<p>
True, compared, for example, with France, not everything is closed here on Sunday; the Lidl supermarket was open until 9.

<p>
Kosice is even smaller than Bratislava; you can walk around the entire center in an hour.

The main attraction is the huge Gothic cathedral.

<p>
Ferenc Rakoczi, the same man with the hussar mustache depicted on Hungarian banknotes, is buried here. He led the Hungarian uprising for independence from Austria during the War of the Spanish Succession (early 18th century). Hungarian patriots tie ribbons to the grave. Almost all of Slovakia should be included in Greater Hungary.

Visually, the cities located in Austria-Hungary have a lot in common. Let's say, I took a similar photo in <a href="../austria">Braunau am Inn</a>, but I could have taken it somewhere in <a href="../croatia">Zagreb</a>.

<p>
Mikhail Kutuzov celebrated the New Year 1806 in Kosice, shortly after the defeat at <a href="../brno">Austerlitz</a>. Though, for him it was not New Year, because in Russia then there was a different calendar.

In Slovakia they sell very luscious souvenirs.

<p>
The numbering of houses is double: along the street, and through the entire area.

Beyond the historical center, Eastern Europe begins.
