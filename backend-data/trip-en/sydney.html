<h1>Australia: Sydney, Canberra, Goulburn</h1>
<i>14-18 April 2019</i>
<h2>Sydney</h2>
<p>
So I got to the main city of Australia with the most recognizable (probably the only widely recognizable) landmark. I took the metro right in the morning and headed there.
<p/>

<p>
The opera stands on the shore of the bay next to the historical and business center of the city. It also has the best view of the Harbor Bridge.

You can walk around the building from all sides and climb closer to the battlements.

Up close you can see that it is gray rather than white.

And there’s even something like this under the roof.

I did not see the concert hall. In general, tickets are not particularly expensive, the cheapest ones are $20, but you need to buy them in advance.

Sydney is the first city founded in Australia and the largest. It's no surprise that there's a lot of Victorian architecture here.

Many of the stations were clearly built 100 years ago as long-distance train stations, before Sydney absorbed these cities.

The city of Parramatta is the second city founded in Australia after Sydney; now they essentially merged smoothly, but it is easy to notice that Parramatta has its own historical and business center. There is a town hall here.

<h2>Blue Mountains</h2>
<p>
The Blue Mountains are an hour and a half train ride from Sydney. The most popular viewing point is located near Katoomba station, but in general the area is quite large, and around other stations in both directions there are also many walking tracks, and in some places, roads. I got off at Leura station, 3 kilometers before Katoomba.

<h2>Canberra</h2>
<p>
Canberra is the capital of Australia. It's a fairly large city (population 400,000), but very sparsely populated, more than other major cities in Australia. Canberra was built from scratch to serve as a capital about 100 years ago, so like other similar cities (see <a href="../delhi">Chandigarh</a>, <a href="../washington">Washington</a>, <a href="../kuala-lumpur">Putrajaya</a>), there is a strict general plan, wide streets, and the government buildings are concentrated in one block.
<p/>

The bus and train stations are located at opposite ends of the city, which determined the trajectory of my movement.

Canberra, especially northern Canberra, is not a very pedestrian-friendly city. For example, the hill with the flag is surrounded by a large junction that you need to cross in a zigzag, otherwise you won’t get to the bridge leading to the south.

It's time to look at a small provincial town in Australia. In Goulburn I had a very long transfer from one train to another. It is a city in the province of New South Wales, famous for being the first non-seaside settlement in Australia to receive city status. Now the population here is 24 thousand people. I was in the city in the evening, there were few cars, but many shops were still open.
