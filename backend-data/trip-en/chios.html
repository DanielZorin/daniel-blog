<h1>Greece: Chios</h1>
<i>8 September 2022</i>
<h2>Chios</h2>
<p>
I have long wanted to travel from Turkey to some Greek island, of which there are quite a few near the western shores (I have already been to <a href="../greece">Rhodes</a>). There are two large islands near Izmir: Chios and Lesvos, the first one is closer, and you can easily go there without spending the night. There are three ferries from Turkish Cesme, but they all depart at about the same time (with a difference of half an hour), once in the morning and the second time around 6 pm. There were a lot of people there, most of them a Spanish-speaking group of tourists with passports of Spain and Mexico.

<p>
I first learned about Chios when I started looking at a map of the western coast of Turkey, that is, this island is so unheard of that even when preparing for the past <a href="../greece">trips</a> <a href="../greece">throughout Greece</a>, I didn’t pay attention to it. Basically, there is an airport here, so you can fly in from the mainland, but there are almost no tourists. The atmosphere of a small sleepy cute town.
This was my first time in the Schengen area since the fall of 2019, when I received a visa and traveled to <a href="../lyon">France</a>. Though, after that I traveled to eight non-Schengen countries on this visa: <a href="../../country/newcaledonia">New Caledonia</a>, <a href="../../country/frenchpolynesia">French Polynesia</a>, <a href="../bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, <a href="../romania">Romania</a>, <a href="../belize">Belize</a>, <a href="../martinique">Martinique</a>, <a href="../guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a> and <a href="../../country/sin%20maarten">Sint Maarten</a>.

<p>
The oldest part of the city is located inside the walls of the Genoese fortress. This fortress is much smaller than in Rhodes or <a href="../thessaloniki">Rethymno</a>.

One of the walls is right along the sea, for some reason it has several vacant lots.

Inside the fortress there are mainly residential buildings, and the busiest part of the city is outside the walls.

I also went to the supermarket to stock up on food. Here is the largest supermarket in Chios, there is also a second one on the outskirts, which looks like a warehouse, but there is no more choice of goods. There was no jamon, but there was Italian prosciutto and cheeses, and I also got alcohol (it’s 2-3 times cheaper here than in Turkey).
<p/>

<p>
But ordinary things are much more expensive here, Kinder biscuits, for example, cost 2.60 euros for 5 pieces, and in Turkey they recently increased in price to 3.50 lira per piece (that is, 5 pieces cost 1 euro).

<p>
On Chios, as it turns out, there is a World Heritage Site that I love so much - the 11th century Byzantine monastery of Nea Moni. It is located in the mountains in the center of the island, so to get there I had to fork out 20 euros for a taxi. It was probably possible to rent a car (there were several rental offices right at the exit from the port), but it would have been more expensive, and it’s not a fact that I would have had time to see much more. The monastery turned out to be closed; you can only get inside early in the morning.

I did not lose heart and went back to the city on foot, it is about 10 kilometers, including the descent from a very high altitude.

At first the road down was a dirt road (the main road for cars is on the other side, but it is much longer)
