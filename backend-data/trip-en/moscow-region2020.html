<h2>Star City</h2>
<p>
In Russia there is such a thing as a "closed administrative-territorial entity" (shortened to ZATO). These are small cities that contain important military installations, most of them related to nuclear weapons. In fact, they are not much different from large military bases (for example, <a href="../guam">US Navy base in Guam</a>), where military personnel live with their families, plus there is a certain number of civilians employed in the service sector. To get into the ZATO you need a pass, but in different ZATOs the rules differ - in some places they may not check anything in fact, but in others they allow you in only for work. In most ZATOs, it is enough for someone who lives there to order a pass for you; there is no need to explain the reason. There are five ZATOs in the Moscow region. The most famous of them is Star City, where the cosmonaut training center is located.

Railway. There is a train station near the town. I just arrived around 6 pm, and saw many people leaving Zvezdny after work and leaving by train. Minibuses also go to Star City from the neighboring city of Shchyolkovo.

<p>
Star City consists of a residential part, in which there are a couple of dozen houses, and the training center itself, which requires a separate pass. The center is behind this fence.

<h2>Kotelniki</h2>
<p>
Studying the map of the Moscow region, I was surprised to discover that not all of the territory southeast of Moscow belongs to <a href="../moscow-region2019">Lyubertsy</a>. It turned out that south of Lyubertsy there are two separate cities adjacent to the Moscow Ring Road: Kotelniki and Dzerzhinsky. These new buildings are already in Kotelniki. Kotelniki became a city in 2004 and was separated from the Lyubertsy district in 2007.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256286511_d91306341f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Kotelniki metro station is unique in that it is located in three cities at once: Moscow, Lyubertsy, Kotelniki.

<h2>Dzerzhinsky</h2>
<p>
I at least knew about Kotelniki that it was a metro station, but I had never heard about the city of Dzerzhinsky. The city is small, and somehow not well-known, and there are no railway stations here; you can only get there by bus from Kotelniki or from Lyublino. It turned out to be a very interesting city that deserves a visit.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255350102_56b41a3391_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On the northern outskirts of Dzerzhinsky there is an old quarry filled with water.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256279913_b76e20d896_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Now you can go water skiing there.

<p>
On the wall is the coat of arms of Dzerzhinsky. One might assume that the coat of arms of a city with that name would feature a Mauser and rusty barbed wire around the Gulag, but, oddly enough, it depicts the walls of a monastery.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256079951_dc15ce19c3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The fact is that Dzerzhinsky was founded in 1380, when Dmitry Donskoy founded the Ugreshsky Monastery in honor of the victory in the Battle of Kulikovo. Until the 20th century, it was the village of Ugresha at the monastery, and then it became a penal colony for street children named after Dzerzhinsky. Monument to the founder of the city.

<h2>Gorki Leninskiye</h2>
<p>
I was in the house where <a href="../samara">Lenin was born</a>, where <a href="../kazan">he studied</a>, where he <a href="../vyborg">organized the revolution</a> and <a href="../vyborg">hid in a hut</a>. One thing was missing - where Lenin died. This is the village of Gorki Leninskiye south of Moscow, now it is part of the Leninsky district. You can get here by bus from Domodedovskaya metro station.

On the highway at the turn to Gorki there is also a monument to Lenin. In total that day I saw a record 19 monuments to Lenin: 10 in a row, one in the museum, two at the beginning and end of the funeral alley (the second in the very first photo), near the school, near the old recreation center and on the highway - that’s 16 in Gorki, and three more in the neighboring town of Vidnoye, where I stopped later.

<h2>Vidnoye</h2>
<p>
Vidnoye is one of the last cities around the Moscow Ring Road that I have not been to. Unlike others (Mytishchi, Krasnogorsk, Reutov, Khimki, etc.), the development of Vidnoye does not begin immediately outside the Moscow Ring Road, there is still a forest park and state farm fields before it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255705871_35f887fb05_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The only exception is the village of the Lenin Sovkhoz (state farm), which is located immediately after the interchange, if you drive from the Domodedovskaya metro station towards the region.
<p/>

The state farm named after Lenin produces strawberries and is owned by Pavel “the candidate of the people” Grudinin.

In Vidnoye there is a railway station called Rastorguevo, from where trains run to Paveletsky Station, but it is quite far from the center. It's easier to take a bus to Domodedovo.

<h2>Dolgoprudny</h2>
<p>
The last city in the Moscow region near the Moscow Ring Road that I had not been to was Dolgoprudny. It’s quite easy to get here on MCD-1, but I did it even more cunningly, and first took a bus to the Northern district of Moscow outside the Moscow Ring Road (which turned out to be very interesting), and from there I walked on foot to the Novodachnaya station in Dolgoprudny.
<p/>

To the north of the Severny district there will be a ledge of Dolgoprudny, on which there is a former military town. Now you can go there freely (a much smaller territory of the military unit itself is fenced and closed), and in the former checkpoint there is a stall.

<h2>Lobnya</h2>
<p>
The city of Lobnya begins behind Dolgoprudny, this is the final station of the MCD-1. I was here once while passing through, when I needed to get to Shermetyevo Airport, terminal B - so as not to make a detour through Khimki with constant traffic jams. Terminal B is just closer to Lobnya, and buses run regularly from there. Quite recently it was reconstructed and now it is used not only for domestic flights, but also for international ones, so the likelihood of getting there has risen sharply (before 2018, I was there only once and was surprised by its emptiness and unchanged state since Soviet times). Lobnya station:

<h2>Domodedovo</h2>
<p>
In the city of Domodedovo there is DME Airport, which until 2014 was essentially the main airport of Moscow (now it is inferior in passenger traffic to Sheremetyevo Airport). In my rating it is still in first place in terms of the number of flights, although Vnukovo is gradually getting closer. As of August 2020, I have been to Domodedovo 61 times, and on the 62nd I finally looked at the city itself. Electric trains from Paveletsky Station go there regularly; before the advent of Aeroexpress trains, most of them also traveled two stops to the airport, but now such trains are quite rare.
