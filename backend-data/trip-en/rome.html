<h1>Italy: Bergamo, Brindisi, Lecce, Bari, Naples, Pompeii, Rome</h1>
<i>5-16 January 2017</i>
<h2>Bergamo</h2>
<p>
For the first time, I was late for a plane - due to a snowstorm, the departure of the Gdansk-Milan flight was delayed by three hours, and I literally missed the second flight from Milan to Brindisi by about 15 minutes. Since the delay was just under three hours, no compensation was due. I had to buy new tickets to Brindisi, fortunately, the next day they cost only 30 euros, that is, a little more than I paid a couple of months before. Though, the flight was inconvenient - 6 am, and as luck would have it, there were no cheap hotels and hostels. I had to stay in the city of Bergamo itself for more than 40 euros. By the time I figured out how to check into an automatic hotel without staff, it was already getting dark.

<h2>Brindisi</h2>
<p>
Brindisi is a small town in the south of Italy, in the part that looks like a heel on the map.

One of the most beautiful cities in southern Italy. At a glance, it strongly resembles <a href="https://goo.gl/vgjuVD">Malta</a>, all the buildings are the same color.

In those days, Italy was attacked by extreme cold. Even in the very south it was snowing. At first it was wet.

<p>
A few hours later, state trains to Bari began running again. But I wanted to go to Alberobello, where only trains from the local railway company go. Their service was restored only at about three o'clock, when there was no point in going there anymore, because I would not have caught the last train further. The worst thing is that I bought tickets from the machine in the morning, not knowing that the train would not leave. But there was no way to return this ticket, because on Saturday there is not a single employee of the railway company at the station, they work only on weekdays.

As a result, due to the weather, I lost the whole day, sitting at the station in Lecce.

<h2>Bari</h2>
<p>
When I arrived in Bari it was already dark. I had to go through another check-in quest - people in Italy are so lazy that they don’t even want to sit at the reception during the day in a hotel with at least 15 rooms. In the morning, the following post-apocalyptic picture appeared before my eyes.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255171177_a629572fd7_o.jpg">
<p>
According to the plan, I was not supposed to hang around in Bari all day, but instead go to the beautiful city of Matera. But no. In general, trains go to Matera every hour or two, but on Sunday the trains have a day off (!), and on the official website of the railway company it was written that buses run instead. After standing at the bus stop for an hour, I gave up - apparently, working in bad weather is not part of the plans of the residents of Bari.

Everyone knows that in Europe many places are closed on Sunday. In Bari this was especially noticeable, because even cafes and restaurants, not just supermarkets, were not open. I had to eat at Burger King, which is characterized by typical Italian misery - note the size of a “standard” glass.

<h2>Naples</h2>
<p>
The Naples metro is famous for the fact that some of the stations there are decorated with various installations, like in <a href="https://goo.gl/gjgGpB">Stockholm</a>. Apart from these two cities, only in Moscow and St. Petersburg the metro can boast of the beautiful design of more than a couple of stations. The most famous station is Toledo.

By default, there is an attitude in the head that Europe is civilization, everything there is clean, comfortable and convenient, while in Asia is chaos - markets on the streets, wires, unauthorized construction, chaotic traffic and a lot of slums. In Naples you understand that the line is much thinner, and just 30-40 years ago, Europe was probably not so different from present-day Asia. I could say this was filmed in India and everyone would easily believe me (if I cropped the sign below):

In principle, any stories about “the best X in the world using a secret recipe” are a marketing ploy. It is clear that fresh pizza is much better than heated in the microwave, but you are unlikely to notice the difference between different ovens.

<h2>Pompeii</h2>
<p>
For the first time I am writing about a city in which no one lives, and for almost 2000 years no less. Unlike <a href="https://goo.gl/sSrByf">Angkor</a> and <a href="https://goo.gl/B1SoRH">Pagan</a>, Pompeii has preserved all the houses and streets, because they were made of stone and were not swallowed up by the jungle.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256854553_9e5fb20211_o.jpg">
<p>
Pompeii starts from the train station. This reminds me of something... well, of course, India: where next to every attraction there are a dozen stalls with the inscription "Ticket office".
<p/>

<p>
By the way, about boobs. In ancient Rome, the topic of sex was much less taboo than even today, not to mention the 18th century, when Pompeii began to be excavated. Many obscene paintings were found on the walls, and in order not to embarrass respectable tourists, they were all transported to the Naples Archaeological Museum, where they were kept mostly in storage for a couple of centuries, and only in the 21st century they became available to the general public. A little can be seen in the brothel building in Pompeii.

On the outskirts of Rome there is an area called EUR, where, under the rule of the fascists, it was planned to move the business center of the city. Everything is in the best traditions of totalitarian imperial architecture - wide avenues, pretentious palaces with columns, statues of pumped-up men, like in Ancient Greece. The city center was also partially changed to suit Mussolini's needs, for example, a wide and empty street leading past the forum to the Colosseum is his work.
