<h1>Puerto Rico: San Juan</h1>
<i>12-13 November 2016</i>
<p>
Puerto Rico has belonged to the United States since 1898, when the Americans took it from Spain (along with <a href="../../country/philippines">Philippines</a>). They still speak Spanish there, but they dream of becoming the 51st state. But Congress is in no hurry, because if Puerto Rico becomes a state, it will immediately top the rankings of the poorest states, and at the same time will reduce per capita GDP in the country.

The neighboring small islands have heavenly beaches.

In the depths are tropical forests.

<p>
This is the capital, the city of San Juan.
<p/>

<p>
It is the oldest city in the USA by a wide margin. If we take only full-fledged states, then the oldest city will be Saint Augustine in Florida.

<p>
San Juan is quite large, there is even a metro there, but the tourist part is only a long and narrow cape, which was originally an island.

Transportation in Puerto Rico is very, very bad. In the USA, in comparison, everything is simply divine. There is no intercity transport on the island at all. There are only “collective taxis”, like in third world countries, except their prices are more similar to the prices of first class trains in Switzerland. There are city buses in San Juan. The official website proudly promises buses from the airport every 10-15 minutes, in reality I waited for more than an hour. On the way back, the bus did not come, and I had to spend almost $20 on a taxi (for a 6 kilometers drive). Taxis in Puerto Rico are all giant jeeps, that fit a whole family of five people and ten suitcases who come here on vacation, no less.

Puerto Ricans are diligently learning to be stingy from their American overlords.

Prices are about the same as on the mainland.

The hostel was outside the old city, but it took me about an hour to get there on foot. The area is also quite nice.

Street signs. The names are Spanish.

<p>
Captions in English and Spanish. English is traditionally florid and inventive, Spanish doesn’t bother.

Cycle path leading to the old town. At this place there used to be a strait that made old San Juan an island.

But this is clearly in the American style: the government house (Capitol).

The old town of San Juan and its two fortresses are included in the UNESCO World Heritage list.

Monument to Columbus. He actually visited here during his expeditions.

<p>
The old town is similar to other Spanish colonies. It is carefully preserved, as they know how to do it in America.

The sidewalks, however, are a bit narrow.
<p/>

<p>
The street signs are reminiscent of Mexican ones.

The area below seems to be a slum; by local standards it looks really poor.

The drawing on the wall corresponds to: “Get rid of the junta!”

In San Juan, the police wear funny round hats.

The second castle looks cool: in front of it is like a huge lawn where you can lie down.
