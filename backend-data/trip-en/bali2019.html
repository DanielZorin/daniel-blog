<h1>Indonesia: Bali</h1>
<i>26 April - 9 May 2019</i>
<h2>Denpasar</h2>
<p>
After Australia, I flew to Bali - this is the closest and cheapest arrival point. I decided to give the island a second chance and explore it more carefully than <a href="../bali">in 2016</a>, fortunately this time I knew what to expect. Last time I was in two main locations (Kuta and Ubud) and a little on the east coast. The western part of the island is not particularly interesting; I passed through it on the way from Java. There is the southern part (south of Kuta), where I also visited a little, and where more elite housing is located. I set my eyes primarily on the northern coast and the mountainous central part. Usually, everyone visits all sorts of temples and other point of interest without spending the night, since in a day you can get anywhere, albeit spending a lot of time in traffic jams. I chose Lovina as a base in the north, but in the south there is still nothing better than Kuta - it is the most centrally located.

<p>
In Kuta everything is pretty much the same as before.
<p/>

<p>
The main streets are densely occupied by all kinds of businesses.

<p>
The narrow passages between the main streets are surrounded by dense fences.

<p>
In Kuta, the fight against taxi apps is in full swing. At the same time, in ordinary Balinese cities (where the majority of Balinese live and there are no tourists) they work great, and no one punctures tires or breaks windows. But in Kuta, the mafia clings to its “legal” right to overcharge on its territory. It is surprising that many Russians consider this normal; apparently, sympathy for petty criminals is still strong in our society.

<p>
Ridiculous logic "if you use a local taxi, part of the money goes to the locals." It's as if Uber and Grab are staffed by aliens and not locals.

Restaurants in Kuta are still excellent and cheap.

Travel agency with excursions. Prices are generally inexpensive, although I’m not sure it’s comfortable to travel by bus given the heavy traffic jams.

In the summer of 2018, I bought summer pants in Greece in the city of <a href="../thessaloniki">Thessaloniki</a> for 5 euros at the H&M store. The pants turned out to be super comfortable, I wore them constantly in hot countries. Over the course of a year they had faded considerably, and then in Australian <a href="../perth">Perth</a> I accidentally went into a store in a beautiful building on the main square and found these same pants for 5 Australian dollars. I bought a more comfortable size M instead of L. The old ones were left in Bali. A month later, I accidentally washed my new pants in the washing machine with something red, as a result they turned a little pinkish; I went around a bunch of stores in Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong and Seoul in search of new ones, but they were no longer available anywhere, the old collection had run out. As a result, I bought another new one, only size S, already in Moscow, picking up the last one from the online store.

<p>
One day I decided to travel from Kuta to Denpasar, the capital and largest city of Bali. This is a city where tourists usually don’t go, because there is neither the sea nor any famous attractions. You can get to Denpasar for pennies on the fairly frequent Trans Sarbagita bus - an attempt to create civilized transport in Bali based on the model of Jakarta. We drove about 5 kilometers to Denpasar for about 40 minutes, however, it took me about the same long time to get back by taxi. This is Bali, baby, they don't like to drive fast here.
<p/>

<p>
In the center of Denpasar, I discovered a very unusual Catholic church (St Joseph), built as if in the Balinese style.

<p>
On the way north we stopped at Ubud - there was a stop halfway there. The 30 kilometers to Ubud took two hours (!), longer than the remaining 100.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255137037_5bd7e3a305_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Ubud is also struggling with taxis. I had no desire to stay for a long time - it’s not a place I want to return to.

<h2>Lovina</h2>
<p>
To explore northern and central Bali, I decided to base myself in the coastal town of Lovina. There is a direct bus service from the Perama bus company, so getting there was no problem. Later I found out that you can get there much cheaper, since local minibuses run from the northern station of Denpasar to the large city of Singaraja, and they run not once a week, as in other places in Bali, but often, about every 30 minutes. From Singaraja to Lovina you can take a taxi for a few dollars, or wait for the more rare Singaraja - Gilimanuk bus (ferry to Java), which runs along the northern coast of the island.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256069173_c9ceb0f406_h.jpg"/>

<p>
Lovina is considered a quiet beach place. Unlike Kuta, there are no waves on the northern coast, so there is no surfing here. As a beach place, in my humble opinion, Lovina is not even a competitor to Pattaya - the beach is nothing, visibility in the water is five centimeters from algae and silt, and it’s downright unpleasant to swim. At the same time, there is no Pattaya breadth of entertainment here, it is just a small town with a limited choice of restaurants, in this regard Kuta is head and shoulders better.
<p/>

This beach is quite small.

<h2>Singaraja</h2>
<p>
Not far from Lovina (8-10 kilometers) there is a fairly famous place in Bali - Aling-Aling waterfall. Using the Gojek app, I easily hired a motorcycle taxi to get there.

The waterfall is located in a deep valley, from the outside you won’t immediately understand that a river flows below.

A little further downstream there are several smaller waterfalls, in which they have set up something like a natural water park.

Getting to the waterfall is easy, but getting back is not so much - there are not many taxis in this village, so I walked 6 km to Singaraja, and at the same time looked at the rural landscapes.

The center of some village. The large building with the flag is not the administration, but the office of the PKK - “organization for the promotion of families”, in fact it was an equivalent of Komsomol for women during the New Order of Suharto (1968-1998), which, however, did not disappear with the collapse of the old regime.

It's almost the center of Singaraja. It is a fairly large city, which was the capital of Bali before Denpasar (during Dutch colonization).

<h2>Munduk</h2>
<p>
The most mountainous part of Bali is just south of Lovina and Singaraja. When you drive from the south of the island, you first climb a high plateau to Lake Beratan, then you drive to the top of the pass, from where you sharply descend along a serpentine road down to the  shore of the sea. From Lovina I drove through the mountains exactly south of it, along lakes Buyan and Tamblingan.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255138707_994ef20cf3_h.jpg"/>

<p>
There are surprisingly many roads here, not only one main highway, but also small narrow roads with a very large slope, on which it is difficult for two cars to pass each other.

I tried coffee. The thing, of course, is for coffee lovers - bitter and hardcore, no syrups for you, just a lump of sugar to snack on.

<h2>Bedugul</h2>
<p>
Before heading back south from Lovina, I decided to stop for a day in the town of Bedugul, home to the famous Lake Beratan Temple, featured on the 50,000 Indonesian Rupiah note. When I got there, I was very surprised: it was as if I had teleported to Sulawesi or Sumatra - this is a completely non-tourist place, it looks like the rest of Indonesia. All tourists are brought to the temple by bus, there are souvenir shops at the entrance, and 200 meters away there are regular markets and noodle shops. There aren’t even really hotels on booking.com, only a couple of expensive ones. In fact, I found a hotel for locals, where I practiced my Indonesian language skills.

<h2>Nusa Dua</h2>
<p>
One day, to complete the picture, I went to the very south of Bali - the Bukit Peninsula, which looks like a wide ledge adjacent to the rest of the island. The Bali airport is located on the isthmus. In 2016, I was in that area on the beaches of the western half of the peninsula, and this time I started from the eastern half. The only civilian bus route in Bali runs from Denpasar there via Kuta, the final stop is Nusa Dua, a place where expensive hotels are concentrated.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255142557_0fc3137085_h.jpg"/>

<p>
The bus arrives at the only street in Nusa Dua that can be called an open-air shopping mall. There are restaurants and shops with perfumes (for some reason, rich tourists love to buy perfumes everywhere, so half of the airports are also packed with them) and souvenirs, and on the sides of this street there are high fences, behind which are the territories of hotels.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256914130_56957b6e76_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There don't seem to be many visitors.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256619949_c526b150ba_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Food is expensive: fried rice, for example, costs $5. In Kuta, even in an above-average class establishment it will cost 2, well, maximum 3. And in an ordinary warung it’s no more than a dollar, maybe even 70 cents.

Off the coast of Nusa Dua there is a place with so-called "blowholes" - these are when waves make passages in volcanic rocks and create fountains.
<p/>

Entrance there costs a couple of dollars, the fee was introduced literally a couple of weeks before my arrival.
