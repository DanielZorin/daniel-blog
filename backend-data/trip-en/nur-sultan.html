<h1>Kazakhstan: Nur-Sultan, Shymkent</h1>
<i>4-8 March 2022</i>
<h2>Nur-Sultan</h2>
<p>
On March 4, 2022, I celebrated my 32nd birthday with an overnight flight to the frosty capital of Kazakhstan. It is still called Nur-Sultan in honor of the first president, but perhaps it will be renamed back to Astana or something else.
<p/>

<p>
Nur-Sultan became the capital recently, and most of the city was built according to a regular plan, but Astana/Tselinograd was already a medium-sized city, so you can still find areas of low-rise buildings next to the wide new avenues.

The snow also formed bizarre patterns.

I walked to the nearest large square, where there is a central mosque and several monuments.

The distances here are of course enormous, as in other capitals built from scratch or almost from scratch (<a href="../brasilia">Brasilia</a>, <a href="../sydney">Canberra</a>, <a href="../kuala-lumpur">Putrajaya</a>).

<p>
Behind it is the main axis of Nur-Sultan, passing through the main attractions. Because of the fog, the skyscrapers are not visible; they are not so close, since there is also a huge park and a river.

On the third day there was no time to wait, it was time to see the main part of Nur-Sultan.

While we were having lunch, it got colder and a snowstorm began. Visibility dropped sharply, but what to do, I went to explore the city anyway.

This tower is a symbol of Nur-Sultan, it is on all photos and postcards. In reality it is much smaller than it seems from the photographs.

<h2>Shymkent</h2>
<p>
Shymkent is the third largest city in Kazakhstan after Almaty and Nur-Sultan. Located in the south, not very far from Almaty (and very close to <a href="../uzbekistan">Tashkent</a>)
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52037311809_92734e053e_o.jpg">

The Soviet-style Shymkent airport is small and cramped.

Shymkent is a real Central Asia, I vividly remembered my long trip to this region in 2013. The atmosphere, architecture are both similar to neighboring countries.

There are some oddities, for example, for some reason in Shymkent there are English telephone booths.
