<h1>Brazil: Foz do Iguacu, Belo Horizonte, Congonhas, Ouro Preto</h1>
<i>16-21 January 2013</i>
<h2>Foz do Iguacu</h2>
<p>
Brazil is very lax about border controls. I entered Brazil by land twice, from Paraguay and from Argentina, and not once did the bus even stop at passport control. The first time I had to run back to the border to get my passport stamped. This is not very surprising, because for residents of South America it is almost like the Schengen zone, passports are not needed, they only look at ID cards, there are no restrictions on the time of stay in the country. And for illegal immigrants, South America is not very attractive.
The city of Foz do Iguaçu is quite boring. In the evening, nothing works; on the main street, only a store near a gas station is open.

Motorcycle taxi advertising. A motorcycle is the fastest way to get into Paraguay, as there is no traffic jam and there are practically no customs checks for motorcyclists.

Well, waterfalls are the best place to cool off under a fountain of spray after a long journey.

There is the largest concentration of foreigners here, everyone takes pictures on the areas in front of the waterfalls.

I wonder how plants exist on small islands right above the cliff of a waterfall?

To get to the cliff you need to walk along a long bridge over a calm part of the river.

For a normal visit to the park you need about 6 hours. In almost five hours I managed to see all the routes, but towards the end I was in a noticeable hurry.

Coati, everyone's favorite. There are posters on every corner saying that they can bite and you should not feed them, but everyone ignores them.

<h2>Belo Horizonte</h2>
<p>
Belo Horizonte can't boast a rich history. The city was founded about 100 years ago. Unlike all the other Brazilian cities I've been to, Belo Horizonte is built on a grid with two diagonals, like La Plata in Argentina. And there are also many works by Niemeyer. More, probably, only in the capital of Brazil.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256960975_21b928f7f2_o.jpg" width="750">

<p>
Niemeyer's creations are concentrated in the wealthy region of Pampulha in the north. The main one is the church, the sight of which would make the hierarchs of the Russian Orthodox Church begin to convulse.

The Belo Horizonte metro consists of one line. It is not very useful for tourists, since it does not go to the main attractions (although in 2014 they promise to open a line to Pampulha and the stadium). The main task of the metro is to transport people living in the residential suburb of Contagem to work in the center.

I didn’t miss the opportunity to go to Contagem, although I didn’t have much time to walk because of the rain.

Slum. Belo Horizonte is the third largest metropolitan area in Brazil, and there are large slums.

<h2>Congonhas</h2>
<p>
People come to the state of Minas Gerais to look at Brazilian antiquity, of which a lot has been preserved here. I chose the cities of Congonhas and Ouro Preto. From Ouro Preto you can go to neighboring Mariana (half an hour by bus), but I liked Ouro Preto so much that I didn’t want to go anywhere. If you really want to, you can visit Congonhas and Sao Joao del Rei (and neighboring Tiradentes) in one day: most buses to Congonhas from Belo Horizonte continue on to Sao Joao del Rei (1 and 3 hours ride respectively) .

The main attraction of the city is this church. The place is quite touristy by Brazilian standards. Where else can you see a whole row of souvenir shops?

The Basilica of Bom Jesus de Matosinhos is so famous because Aleijadinho worked on it. It may be a legend, but it is believed that when this church was built, Aleijadinho (who also worked on many of the churches in Ouro Preto) had leprosy and lost his fingers, so he worked with a hammer strapped to his forearm. On the road down there are houses with wooden statues depicting the Passion of Christ.

The way back was strange. It seems that there is a bus schedule, but in fact there are more of them. As soon as a new bus arrives, tickets for it begin to be sold at the ticket office.

<h2>Ouro Preto</h2>
<p>
Ouro Preto is the most beautiful city in the world. Here time stands still in the nineteenth century. Where else can you meet ladies in ancient dresses on the street?

A tourist train runs from Ouro Preto to the neighboring town of Mariana. Here it is. But that day it did not work, and the station was closed.

I never went to Mariana, although you can go by bus. It was too good in Ouro Preto. I watched football players practice, passing the ball to each other across the field.

In the middle of the city there is a completely abandoned hill on which there is no one, and only a structure similar to an altar stands. This is the best place to see the entire panorama of the city around.
