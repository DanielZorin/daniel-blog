<h1>Iran: Shiraz, Persepolis, Yazd, Isfahan, Qom</h1>
<i>23-27 August 2022</i>
<h2>Shiraz</h2>
<p>
Shiraz is the center of the Fars region (from which the name Persia comes) and the cultural capital of Iran. It was also the capital of all of Iran for a short time in the 18th century.

Shiraz Airport.
<p/>

<p>
The metro station is located a kilometer from the airport, it is strange that the line was not extended a little. I took the metro just to see what it looked like.

<p>
In Shiraz, plastic tokens are used as tickets, as in Kuala Lumpur and some Chinese cities. At first I tried, out of habit, to press the token at the turnstile (in Kuala Lumpur the price depends on the distance, and you have to throw the token into the turnstile at the exit), but here you just put it directly into the turnstile, as in St. Petersburg.

The interior is mostly empty, but there are a few rooms with stained glass windows.

Water is sprayed on the pedestrian street to keep people cool. It was not very hot in Shiraz (compared to Bandar Abbas), I walked easily.

<p>
The main pilgrimage site in Shiraz is the Shah Cherakh mausoleum, where two brothers of Imam Reza are buried. Like other mausoleums, this is a whole complex with several mosques and courtyards. At the entrance I was detected as a foreigner and given a guide.
<p/>

Behind the mausoleum I discovered an area that partially preserved its historical appearance. Some areas have been restored.

I found a cafe nearby with European food and grabbed a Caesar salad and pizza.
<p/>

<p>
The Caesar salad turned out to be simply huge, I was full of it alone.

<h2>Persepolis</h2>
<p>
In the vicinity of Shiraz there are many ruins of ancient cities from different eras of Persian history. The most famous ones date back to the Achaemenid era - the first Persian Empire, which existed from 550 to 329 BC. In terms of area, it was the largest Persia; it included the territories of modern Turkey, Egypt, Syria, Israel, Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The capital of the Achaemenid Empire was Persepolis, the ruins of which are located near the modern city of Mervdasht, an hour's drive from Shiraz.

<p/>

<p>
What we see now is the very central part of the ancient city, where there were several palaces and state halls adjacent to each other. It was all on a platform higher than the rest of the city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52419365315_cd1e648ea3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The steps are specially low so that it is convenient to climb, and you can even ride a chariot.

<p>
From Pasargadae I wanted to go to Yazd. I had already traveled about 100 kilometers in the direction of Yazd, and I didn’t want to go back to Shiraz to catch a bus there. So I tried to catch it on the highway near the nearest town of Saadet Shahr. There were a lot of buses passing there, most heading towards Tehran and Isfahan, some towards Yazd, they all stopped there to check in at the police checkpoint, but they were all full and did not take passengers. After standing for more than an hour, I decided to go somewhere and took a bus towards Tehran to get to the town of Surmak at the turn. In Surmak, I was advised to go first to the neighboring city of Abarkuh, and then look for a collective taxi to Yazd. In the end, this happened, at the same time I found out how much a taxi between cities costs and realized that it is so cheap that you can even take a taxi alone.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52418929836_77dac7dc87_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Abarkuh looks curious, as I later realized, similar to Yazd.

<h2>Yazd</h2>
<p>
Yazd is probably the most interesting city in Iran in terms of architecture. It preserves an extensive historical center, listed as a World Heritage Site.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52418342397_b2f7cd2a1e_h.jpg"/>

<p>
I settled in a hotel - caravanserai. You can imagine what local houses look like from the inside, since it is not clear from the outside.

The historical center consists of a maze of streets with concrete walls around the houses.

Apparently, this is what cities in the Middle East looked like 100  years ago, now there are only a few of them left - Yazd, Urfa, Bukhara.

Central square. Previously, it seemed like it was possible to climb the tower, but now it’s not.

<p>
Behind this square there is a huge area that looks about the same as the old city, but much less touristy, there are not many hotels there.
<p/>

There is also a relief here, you can see from above.

Zoroastrianism is an ancient religion of Persia, which was widespread before Islam. It still has a number of followers.

There is also a classical Persian garden in Yazd, included in the UNESCO list (in Shiraz the garden is a botanical garden, but here it’s just like a park).

For dinner I went to the most expensive looking restaurant on the main street on the roof (still quite cheap compared to most countries). The most expensive local kebab and saffron rice:

<h2>Isfahan</h2>
<p>
Isfahan is the third largest city in Iran and the former capital. There are also a lot of historical attractions here, but by this time I, it seems, had already seen the most interesting things in Shiraz, Mashhad, and Tehran, so I looked around Isfahan more lazily.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52419380285_057a4289b1_h.jpg"/>

<p>
Isfahan also has a metro, one line, but the second one is almost completed. They let me in for free, since payment was only made using Iranian cards.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52419458138_90d80be5e4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The station in the center where I wanted to get off turned out to be closed, apparently they are preparing to open a second line to which there will be a transfer, I had to go back one station.
<p/>

<p/>

The square is huge, on one side is the Imam Mosque, on the other - the palace, on the third - the market.

It is very unusual to see the mosque so empty, only rare tourists walk through it, since it works mainly as a museum (you need to buy a ticket at the entrance). There are also no carpets on the floors. Usually mosques in Iran are very crowded, but here it was like walking into a cathedral somewhere in Europe.

You can come here to pray during one of the five prayers; especially for this purpose, carpets are laid in the center of the courtyard.

After walking more than a kilometer through the galleries of the market, I came to the second square, about the size of Naqshe Jahan, but without palaces.

<h2>Qom</h2>
<p>
Qom is the second holy city in Iran after Mashhad. Foreign tourists also come here quite often, since it is located on the route between Tehran and Isfahan. As in Mashhad, the entire city center is oriented toward pilgrims who come to visit the mausoleum of Fatima Masumeh, the sister of Imam Reza (who is buried in Mashhad).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52419360745_190d5cd8b1_h.jpg"/>

In the city center, most people wear black or white clothes.
