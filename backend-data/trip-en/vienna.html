<h1>Austria: Vienna</h1>
<i>26-28 May 2012</i>
<h2>Vienna</h2>
<p>
Vienna is the capital of the former empire. This empire can hardly be called great. During its existence from 1804 to 1918, it crushingly lost all the wars in which it participated: many campaigns against Napoleon, the war with Italy, the war with Prussia, the First World War. However, the achievements of the past, for example, the time of Charles the Fifth, clearly haunted the Habsburgs of the nineteenth century. Their capital is unrivaled in Europe in terms of splendor and pathos. Instead of the old German crown, the emperor made himself a new one.

The old one also remains in the museum to this day.

Along with the crown, the emperors made themselves a set of household items made of gold.

The whole city was filled with statues with gilded swords and helmets.

Here is the parliament building, where one failed artist spent his time free from work at a construction site, accumulating hatred for the Czechs and Poles who spoke there on the podium.

Even the Soviet soldier-liberator wears a golden helmet and holds a golden shield with a golden sickle and hammer in his hands.

Even the key attached above the entrance to the entrance of an ordinary house is gold.

It is strange that the statue near the palace is not golden. On that day, by the way, there was a rally for Tibetan independence.

Rostral column. Austria was once a maritime power, but I have not heard about any achievements in this area, with the exception of Franz Josef Land, which solder Swejk spoke about.

Only in terms of fountains are the Austrian imperial residences inferior to the Russian ones.

There is only one large fountain in Schönbrunn.

At first I didn't like Vienna. In addition to the flashy luxury and crowds of people on the main street, an important role in this was played by the fact that there are a lot of dogs here. True, unlike Russia, dogs here are trained, so they don’t dare open their vile mouths on the street, and they don’t need to be avoided. On the second day, I bought a full-day pass and went to improve my opinion of Vienna. The first stop was Hundertwasser's house.
<p/>

<p>
Opposite the apartment building there is a souvenir shop, decorated by Hundertwasser in the same way as the house. Hundertwasser turned out to be a worthy successor to Gaudi.

Having enjoyed the beauty, I went to the final metro station to look at the multiculture. The Favoriten district is considered almost the creepiest, but it looks pretty decent, not destroyed, there are even hotels. Disorder occurs sporadically.

Judging by the inscriptions, the main population consists of Turks and Albanians, aka “kebaps”, who were removed from the territory of Serbia...

In the very center, some Arabs were rallying in support of Syria.

By the way, about train stations. Vienna train station is terrible. Arriving at the nearby metro station, I searched for the station for at least an hour. From the metro station you can take the train one stop to the main station or walk, but it took a while to find someone who knew the way. During this time, they managed to ask me for directions several times. The station looks unpresentable.

<p>
And the station is small, you won’t even notice it right away. However, the authorities realized this and right now a normal station is being built there.

The Danube is divided into two streams by a very narrow and long green island. On one side the water is cloudy.

On the other hand, it is transparent. At the spit of the island, two streams merge into one.

Four types of Viennese traffic lights: the color indicates either a pedestrian or a background; a bicycle can be drawn next to a person. There are paths on the sidewalks for bicycles.

Vienna's calling card is bags of newspapers on every pillar. There is a hole above the bag where you need to throw money, and often the amount is not round (for example, 1 euro 90 cents). Everything is designed solely for honest people. They say that some people still take newspapers for free. The Vienna metro is also designed for the honest, but they still sometimes organize hunts for fare dodgers, so residents buy a pass for a year (it turns out to be about 1 euro per day) rather than pay fines.

Advertising stickers here are small and modest, they are hung on poles and road signs.

The urns look like cigarette packs with one sticking out of the side.

Each street name is preceded by a district number. The first district is the very center, only the richest live here. Districts with two-digit numbers (10-22) are outskirts of varying degrees of multiculturalism.

Fountain with drinking water. Interestingly, there is a shower attached to the side. Apparently for the homeless?

In general, Vienna is a very livable city, well-equipped and not boring.

The only inconvenient thing is that nothing works in the evening, and during the day you can find deserted places even a stone's throw from the central square.
