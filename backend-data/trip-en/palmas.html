<h1>Spain: Las Palmas de Gran Canaria</h1>
<i>28-30 September 2012</i>
<h2>Las Palmas</h2>
<p>
The idea to visit the Canary Islands was born spontaneously after looking at the map, which shows that El Aaiun and Las Palmas are very close. I have a particularly warm attitude towards Spain, at one time I even thought about a route to go around the whole country in a circle (with a stop in Portugal), then I abandoned this idea, but decided to visit all the main regions of Spain in two big trips: one around the northern coast and the other along the southern coast. Unfortunately, this year I didn't have three weeks in a row in the summer to carry out my plan to travel around northern Spain, so that idea was pushed back to next year. In these Napoleonic plans, remote territories stood apart: Ceuta, Melilla and especially the Canaries. I didn’t want to go there purposefully, because there are only beaches there, and the flight is far away. Therefore, the opportunity to visit them while passing through seemed tempting to me.

I expected that the best thing about the city of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria is its wonderful name and the rest is a beach with huge hotels. It was all the more pleasant to realize that this was not so.

There are not only hotels here, there is everything: palm trees, blue express trains, blue sea, white steamboat, white pants, dinners on pure animal oil, and so on. <i>Quote from the novel "Golden Calf" by Ilf and Petrov</i>

<p>
There are two centers in Las Palmas, several kilometers apart: historical and modern. For this reason, the historical center is quiet and half empty.

<p>
Unlike Madrid and Barcelona, the houses are one- and two-story.
<p/>

<p>
The trees are tiled on all sides.

<p>
You can climb to the very top and look into the distance.

When I'm old, I wouldn't mind living somewhere on this hill. All the benefits of civilization are here, except that it’s a bit far to fly.

<p>
Adjacent to the historical center is a shopping area with a typically Spanish landscape.
<p/>

<p>
Residential areas are small streets surrounded by vegetation.
<p/>

<p>
From time to time you come across a wide area from which breathtaking views of the hills open up.

<p>
In one square there is a monument to pole vaulters.
<p/>

Nearby are traces of the previous night.

<p>
As in Madrid, monuments are sometimes erected here on the roofs.
<p/>

<p>
Sometimes between new houses you come across the remains of old ones.

The modern city center, where 99% of hotels are located, is located near the beach.
<p/>

<p>
The beach is quite long, it forms a bay, the entrance to which is also closed by small reefs a couple of hundred meters from the shore. Even weak waves are very powerful on them, and there is a real risk of getting hurt on sharp rocks.
<p/>

<p>
Where the beach ends, black volcanic rocks begin.
<p/>

<p>
Around the beach there is a modern, well-equipped city.
<p/>

<p>
There are a couple of artsy skyscrapers.
<p/>

<p>
An ordinary intersection.

<p>
Multiculturalism is gradually eroding Las Palmas.

<p>
What is very pleasing about Spain (and Portugal) is the opportunity to eat cheap, satisfying and tasty. The best establishments here are called “bars” or “cafes”.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257091054_5fa4d9a857_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At first glance, these places look inconspicuous. Locals sit at the bar and drink beer. But at the same time, there is a good selection of dishes with very affordable prices by Moscow standards, about 5-6 euros for half a chicken with side dishes.

I love Spain for its revolutionary freedom-loving spirit. Protests against the government of swindlers and thieves in Spain have approximately the same effect as in Russia, but in my subjective opinion, they are much more spectacular. Not least of all, this is because the bulk of the protesters (unless, of course, these are trade union rallies) are students, and not the boring old-school liberals.

I was a few days late and missed a large protest that was taking place throughout Spain, including in the seemingly prosperous Canary Islands. From it, leaflets with truly Napoleonic slogans remained on the walls, which Navalny could envy: in addition to the standard “resignation of the government” and “release of political prisoners,” they demand nothing less than the convening of the Constituent Assembly and universal social justice.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257384005_22e8154ce1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Trade unions are no longer credible and are openly ridiculed.
<p/>

<p>
Dissatisfaction with migration policy has reached here too.
<p/>

<p>
On the same bus schedule, an unknown person expressed his dissatisfaction with the fact that there is no actual schedule, but only a list of stops. Naive, he should go to Moscow or Staraya Russa.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257090039_1bc1c4dbb8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The schedule actually looks good.
<p/>

<p>
The emblem of the Canary Islands depicts dogs of some local variety, and there is even a monument to them in the main square. Fortunately, this abomination is practically invisible on the streets.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257090599_a756158efc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Visual propaganda taught local residents to isolate dangerous animals from people. In particular, dogs are prohibited from approaching children.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255612227_564bfb0b08_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Dogs are also prohibited in the parks. The owners probably walk their dogs in their backyards.
<p/>

<p>
The emblem of Las Palmas, as it is easy to assume, is a palm tree, or rather its branch. According to the old Spanish tradition, the emblem is applied to all city urns.
<p/>

<p>
A huge sign warns that talking on the phone while driving will result in three penalty points being added to your license. There is probably a video recorder on the arch.
<p/>

<p>
Parking off the sidewalk is marked with huge letters on the ground.

<p>
A wonderful emblem of Mauritanian Airlines, with subtle humor.
<p/>

<p>
Street name signs in a modern city are not very noticeable
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255612122_82231b4a1c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The closer you get to the historical center, the more interesting it becomes.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256541808_2071191f5d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Signs with monograms appear.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256541693_5bd120460a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Then the house numbers made up of individual tiles are shown.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256541863_64873ad222_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And then the old beauty begins.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255612867_4710874004_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Many names are simply raised letters attached to the wall of a house.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255612772_ce6cd2f62e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Or white tiles, again with raised letters.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256542043_f0dc665716_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A modern analogue is flat tiles.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256542033_d5556fe7bc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Also in large quantities there are plaques with a coat of arms and ornate font, assembled from tiles. They also show the old name. I wonder when they managed to rename so many streets there, under Franco?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256344051_9d13f05ca8_h.jpg"/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256344111_fbb00b0f2d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Besides the street names, Las Palmas has another unusual feature: a lot of raised road signs. For example, a parking ban.
<p/>

<p>
They were not too lazy to make the silhouette of the children in relief...
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256344596_8f1a663069_h.jpg"/>
<p>
...and even an intelligent pedestrian in a hat and crossing stripes.
