<h1>Zimbabwe: Victoria Falls, Bulawayo</h1>
<i>4-5 February 2024</i>
<h2>Victoria Falls</h2>
<p>
After seeing the waterfalls, I went to the border across the bridge. From the bridge you can again look at the waterfall.

The girl in the photo looks like Regina Todorenko, who actually bungee jumped here in the "Heads and Tails" series.

And from here you can see the gorge of the Zambezi River, where it flows after the waterfall.

The Zimbabwean city is called Victoria Falls. It's right next to the border (unlike Livingstone, which is still 10 kilometers away). Entrance to the lookout from Zimbabwe:

I walked into the town itself. It is small, only 30k people. Many hotels and restaurants.

On the left is the railway station, more like a stop. There used to be overnight trains from here to Bulawayo, with sleeper cars - a pretty good way to travel. But everything was closed due to Covid, and has not yet opened.

Bus station. I wanted to go straight to Bulawayo so that I wouldn’t get there too late. The time was around 1 pm, but it turned out that the last bus left at 12, and the next ones would be at 8 pm (overnight buses). I didn’t want to sit for seven hours in the middle of nowhere and ride all night, so I jumped on a bus that was just leaving for the city of Hwange (it’s about 100 km away), and then I’d figure it out as I go.

There was an incredible number of churches in the city of Hwange. On the main street they stand in a row, one after another - all of different faiths.

In Hwange there were also no buses to Bulawayo for the near future. Another local man wanted to go to Bulawayo, and advised to try our luck on the highway, that is, by hitchhiking. As it turns out, in Zimbabwe (and in many other African countries) the practice of giving rides to passengers is very common, although unlike Europe or post-Soviet countries, drivers expect payment (some travellers managed to ride for free, but, of course, it takes longer to catch a car). This compensates for the lack of public transport. So almost every car with free seats will pick up passengers for money, but there were very few cars heading towards Bulawayo. The population density in Zimbabwe is low, from Hwange to Bulawayo there is essentially only one small town for 300 kilometers. But after about an hour and a half, we finally stopped the truck driving all the way to Bulawayo. Place where I hitchhiked:

<p>
Road. This section is good, but very often there were sections with a lot of holes, so the average speed was not very high.

<h2>Bulawayo</h2>
<p>
Bulawayo is the second largest city in Zimbabwe. It turned out to be much nicer than Harare: there is no such terrible crowd and traffic jams, it is cleaner, nicer, more colonial architecture, and in general it looks more like a city rather than a market.
<p/>

<p>
Since I was not sure whether I would make it to Bulawayo that day, I did not book a hotel. There are not many options on booking.com and they are somehow far from the center, so I wanted to try to find something locally, fortunately there were several hotels marked on the map. In the end, it turned out even better; my travel companion, with whom we were hitchhiking from Hwange, advised me of a working hotel, where I settled. The room cost $30, a bit expensive considering that the room was quite shabby. But it was even more expensive at booking.com. Zimbabwe is not cheap.
<p/>

<p>
There was a nightclub on the ground floor of the hotel; there were even bouncers at the entrance. The club looked something like this:
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537411864_4cd1a8e446_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I didn’t want to party, but really wanted to eat. There is also a dining room at the club (during the day there is an entrance from the street, and in the evening only from inside the club). The food there didn't look appealing, but there wasn't much choice. Fortunately, it cost only $2, so you can consider this a test drive of the most budget-friendly food in Zimbabwe. On the left it looks like mashed potatoes, but it is a sticky corn porridge, called "pap" in South Africa, and "sadza" in Zimbabwe. On the right are pieces of meat and some leaves, meat with large bones and fatty, but overall quite edible.

In the morning, they washed the sidewalk with soap near my hotel.

The center of Bulawayo is a rectangular grid of streets. The streets are unusually wide.

There are distance markers on the house to Cairo and Cape Town. This is not without reason - after the First World War, Britain received the colonies of southern and eastern Africa, a continuous strip from South Africa to Egypt (and the western coast mostly went to France). And there was an idea to build a railway from Cairo to Cape Town, in particular the line from Bulawayo to Lusaka through Victoria Falls was part of it. But the road was never completed; there is still a gap somewhere between Sudan and Uganda.
