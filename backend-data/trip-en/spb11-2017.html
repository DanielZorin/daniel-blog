I went to St. Petersburg for one day just like that, without a specific purpose.

Two steps from here is the Ionoteka bar, where singer Grechka’s career began, and where RBL rap battles take place. Once upon a time there was an “Alpha Bar” in the same area, where #SlovoSPB battles took place, but it closed long ago.
