<h1>Japan: Okinawa</h1>
<i>25-29 February 2020</i>
<h2>Okinawa</h2>
<p>
To the south of the main body of the Japanese islands is the Ryukyu islands chain, stretching almost all the way to <a href="../taiwan">Taiwan</a>. They were an independent kingdom (albeit under Japanese influence) until almost the end of the 19th century, and the Ryukyuan language, which is related to Japanese, was preserved here. After World War II, the islands were under US occupation for almost 30 years, and there are still American military bases there. After the war, with the development of aviation, the islands became a popular resort due to their warmer climate than most of Japan. In February you could wear summer clothes here, when in Tokyo you need at least a jacket.

<p>
The two main islands with the most flights from Tokyo and Taiwan are Okinawa (to the north) and Ishigaki (to the south). I thought for a long time whether to go to both or just one, in the end I decided to visit only Okinawa, since diving and swimming in February was still impossible. Okinawa is a fairly large island, stretching for 150 kilometers.

Okinawa is very different from typical Japan with narrow streets and small apartments. This is a very car-oriented island, almost like America, and here you can see multi-lane highways in the city center, unprecedented in the rest of Japan. Getting around the island without a car is difficult - buses to the far ends do not go very often and are not cheap. The attractions are mostly not in cities, so by bus you can at best go to one place there and back, while by car you can visit five at a time. Therefore, this is a rare place where it makes sense to rent a car. At that time, I already had a driver’s license, but due to bureaucratic conflicts with Russian licenses (even international ones), it was impossible in principle to rent a car in Japan. So it was necessary to somehow figure a solution.

<p>
The capital of Okinawa, Naha City, is located in the southern part of the island. In general, this city is easy to get around on foot. You can also take the metro-monorail, one line of which winds through the entire city, starting from the airport.

Recently they began accepting Tokyo transport cards, which apparently caused the turnstiles to stop working normally with paper tickets; each time they were taken away by the turnstile guards at the exit.

Okinawa has a World Heritage Site, or rather a whole group of local medieval castles. One of them is located in Naha, this is Shuri Castle, where the rulers of the island lived. The rest are scattered throughout the island and for the most part only preserved the walls.

I decided to walk to the castle purely for fun. Along the way there are many residential areas, hills, stairs up and down.

An interesting feature of Okinawa castles is their unusual shape - not a square or an oval, but like arcs connected to each other.

I spent a long time choosing where I could go from Naha by bus around the island, and in the end I decided to move to the northwest along the coast. I got off the bus in the village of Yomitan, and from there I walked to Zakimi Castle.

In 1945, American troops carried out an amphibious operation and fought to capture Okinawa. Propaganda convinced the inhabitants of the island that the Americans would definitely rape them, and then cut them into pieces and eat them, so the inhabitants of the surrounding villages hid in a cave and did not want to give up. But two of them knew English, because they worked in <a href="../hawaii">Hawaii</a>, and convinced their neighbors that they were not in danger.
