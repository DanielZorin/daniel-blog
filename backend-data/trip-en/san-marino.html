<i>28 January 2009</i>
<p>
I remember San Marino only for the fact that all the sellers in the stores there are Russians or Ukrainians. I also bought a new flash drive for the camera there (instead of the one I had forgotten at home), but this happened at the very end of my stay in this tiny country.
