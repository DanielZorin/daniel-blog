<h1>Turkey: Çıralı, Altınyaka</h1>

<h2>Çıralı</h2>
<p>
On my third try, I finally made it to Mount Chimera. I drove the car to the far corner of the village of Çıralı, where there is a large parking lot and the stairs begin.

This is what the entrance looks like.

<p>
The climb from this side is very simple and short, only a kilometer in length and 150 meters in height.
<p/>

<p>
The entire road is a path or stairs.

At the very end there are ruins of several Byzantine churches.

Here is the Chimera (in Turkish: yanartaş, that is, “burning rock”).
<p/>

<p>
The burning part is not the top. You can climb further and only get to the pass leading towards Mount Tahtalı.

<p>
There is a release of methane here, which is why the fire is constantly burning in the recesses.

<h2>Altınyaka</h2>
<p>
I have long wanted to drive through the mountains beyond Kemer. There is a road right through the mountains, running parallel to the seashore, and connecting Kumluca and Antalya. As it turned out, the road is located in the Kumluca district, running almost parallel to the border of the Kemer district.
<p/>

<p>
I drove south from Çıralı and turned off the highway onto small roads to take them onto the mountain road. Immediately beautiful views of Kumluca.

The green field is reminiscent of Austria.

<p>
The roads are quite narrow, however, I have seen trucks on them more often than cars - they seem to be hauling something from the quarries.

I got onto the main road, it’s not difficult to pass each other.
<p/>

The largest village on this road is called Altınyaka.

There are even a couple of high-rise buildings here.

It turns out that behind the coastal mountains there is a fairly wide and deep valley from Antalya to Finike, and behind the valley there are new mountains.

Somewhere here there should be the ruins of the city of Kitanaura. I arrived at the point marked on the maps.

I rummaged around the forest a little in search of more excavations (the point on the map was not directly on the road, but a little to the side).

There was probably something else, but it was getting dark soon, and I didn’t want to drive along this road in the dark.

A fork where you can turn straight from the Kumluca - Antalya road to Kemer.
