<h1>Japan: Kobe, Himeji, Okayama, Kurashiki, Marugame, Takamatsu, Okunoshima, Hiroshima</h1>
<i>10-14 December 2017</i>
<h2>Kobe</h2>
<p>
Kobe is a large city very close to Osaka and Kyoto. If you have an unlimited travel pass, you can use it as a base in Kansai, because the ride to Osaka is about 30 minutes maximum, and housing is cheaper here. Kobe is famous for its ultra-expensive marbled Kobe beef, but first of all I went to see the Kitano district, where many mansions from the late 19th and early 20th centuries are well preserved.

<p>
In Japan they are called "Ijinkan" - houses of foreigners.

<p>
Like Yokohama, Kobe was a major port, so visitors from Europe settled here.

Now many of them are museums.

<p>
There are quite a lot of Japanese tourists here, looking at European architecture.

<p>
Kobe also has a metro, but I didn’t have time to ride it.

On the way further south, the Akashi-Kaikyo Bridge connecting the islands of Honshu and Shikoku is clearly visible.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256477133_50825d9ee9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is the longest suspension bridge in the world - the central span is almost 2 kilometers long! For comparison, <a href="../san-francisco">Golden Gate</a>, the longest bridge from 1937 to 1964, is 1280 meters long.

<h2>Himeji</h2>
<p>
Himeji is home to Japan's most famous castle, one of the remaining ones, and the most easily accessible in terms of transportation, because the city even has a bullet train stop.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257223110_dcf473240b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
All reviews do not recommend going inside, as there is nothing interesting there.
<p/>

<p>
Well, I didn't go.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256928274_c909f8cec9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Tourists take pictures en masse in the castle courtyard; in other castles I visited, there was usually almost no one there (except Osaka Castle).

<h2>Okayama</h2>
<p>
In the large city of Okayama, midway between Osaka and Hiroshima, I spent the night in a capsule hotel combined with a Japanese bathhouse.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256586396_b9de4e4fb5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A classic capsule hotel. The capsules occupied the 4th floor, on the third there was a lounge area, on the second - the entrance, reception and the bathhouse itself.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257629320_9d83046f47_h.jpg"/>
<p>
TV and radio control panel. It turned out that the capsule did not lock. Maybe it was because I had a locker in the bathhouse changing room.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255858737_87b6560742_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Among the attractions in Okayama is the black castle (reconstructed).

<p>
There is a weapons exhibition inside and a good view of the city from the top floor.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257333524_31d7cd1ca1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Opposite the castle is the Koraku-en Garden, one of the three main classical gardens in Japan. The other two are in the city of Kanazawa (on the west coast) and in the city of Mito north of Tokyo.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257628800_4f783b509f_h.jpg"/>

<p/>

<p>
Not the best time to visit this garden; leaf fall has already passed.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256787423_98df70b722_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The grass had also turned yellow, so most of the garden looked like this. It's better to come here in summer.
<p/>

<h2>Kurashiki</h2>
<p>
The well-preserved old town of Kurashiki is only a 15-20 minute ride from Okayama.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257365375_7c766706cd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This town also has several canals.

<p>
Kurashiki can be easily distinguished from other old cities by the characteristic square grid on the walls of the houses.
<p/>

<h2>Marugame</h2>
<p>
The fourth largest Japanese island, Shikoku, is rarely visited by tourists - there are no large cities or famous attractions. But it’s not difficult to get there; three bridges connect it with Honshu, and you can drop in from Kobe, Okayama or Hiroshima. Less than an hour from Okayama, and I'm in Marugame.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256427581_b4d76b7f46_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The road goes over the Seto-Ohashi Bridge - the longest two-level bridge in the world. In fact, this is not one bridge, but a series of bridges going through several small islands.

Crossroads with a railway crossing. Such intersections in Japan are amazingly effective: as soon as the last car reaches the middle of the intersection, the barrier begins to rise; when the car has passed the intersection, the barrier at the same moment finishes rising.

<h2>Okunoshima</h2>
<p>
The small island of Okunoshima has become famous due to the sky-high population of rabbits that inhabit it. And once it was a gloomy military base with a chemical plant.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255864572_fb59129539_h.jpg"/>
<p>
To get to Okunoshima, you need to transfer from Mihara Station on the main line to a local train along the coast to Tadanoumi Station (in the city of Takehara).
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257338364_4c0de63a39_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a ferry from there, quite inexpensive - 620 yen round trip. You can also buy rabbit food at the ferry terminal.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257338394_8458c87431_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The ferry is large and car-carrying; after calling at Okunoshima, it goes further to larger islands where non-tourist passengers go. The view from the water is like this:
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257633840_587d2e381d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are no cars on Okunoshima, but there is one bus that runs from the ferry to the only building on the island - the hotel. But I easily walked around the entire island on foot in a circle, visiting the mountain in the center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257635195_8a23840648_h.jpg"/>

If you go in the opposite direction from the hotel, a destroyed factory building will soon appear.

<h2>Hiroshima</h2>
<p>
Of course, everyone knows about the city of Hiroshima, because it was destroyed by an atomic bomb in 1945. The bomb exploded over the very center of the city and destroyed everything around almost completely, because almost all the houses were small and wooden.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256181281_ce7051ae4b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This famous building with a dome (now a UNESCO monument), which was left as a memorial, was located a couple of hundred meters from the epicenter, but since it was not wooden, the walls held up.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256181406_5da560659e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Interestingly, there are two other pre-war buildings in Hiroshima that survived the bombing. One of them is a bank:
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256181531_5f48bc74ad_h.jpg"/>

On the site of the former city center at the junction of two rivers there is now a peace memorial park.
<p/>

<p>
Paper cranes. The story of the girl who died 10 years after the war from leukemia caused by radiation, and folded 1000 cranes in the hospital, is widely known. Now Hiroshima is absolutely safe - only those who were there that day and received a dose of radiation were harmed. By modern standards, the bomb was not very strong and exploded high in the air, so a week after the explosion in Hiroshima it was quite possible to walk without a chemical protective suit. In Chernobyl, the power was thousands of times greater and the radiation contaminated the earth, so it is not entirely safe to travel there even now.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255451677_d2986eb1ac_h.jpg"/>

<p/>

<p>
The second bomb was dropped three days later on the city of Nagasaki on the island of Kyushu. The diagram shows that due to the hilly terrain of Nagasaki, only a narrow strip between two hills was destroyed there, while the city center (down by the bay) was not affected so much. Hiroshima on the plain was completely demolished.
<p/>

In Hiroshima I went to explore karaoke. The building is divided into small rooms with thick walls. The walls, at least in this karaoke, turned out to be not as thick as I thought; if you stand at the door, you can basically hear what they are singing inside. It’s also visible through the door, so using karaoke as a replacement for a love hotel won’t work.

The main attraction of Hiroshima that is not related to the war is, of course, the island of Miyajima and the famous gate in the water, depicted on the cover of half of the guidebooks to Japan.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256180936_0d4ab32ff2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
As a child, I looked at a photograph of this gate in a book about the wonders of the world and could not understand how it was possible to fit an entire temple into two columns and crossbars above them? I thought there was something inside the columns, but in reality it's just a gate in the shallow water.
