<h1>Eswatini: Hlane, Manzini, Mbabane</h1>
<i>11-13 February 2024</i>
<h2>Hlane National Park</h2>
<p>
When planning my trip, I devoted a few days to visit Eswatini, and closer to the point I began to think about what to see there, in addition to the capital. In this country there is an opportunity to visit nature reserves: as in South Africa, you can drive into the parks yourself by car. There are about 10 parks in Eswatini, but there are two main ones with large animals: the state Hlane and the private Mkhaya. You can’t drive in Mkhaya on your own, so I thought about going to the first one. And then I looked at how much housing in the park cost, and decided not to rent a car, but just spend the night in the park, and get there by public transport, since the entrance is right on the main road leading to Mozambique. After the border, I took a bus to the capital and went straight to the park.

<p>
The roads in Eswatini are good. There is nothing here except the entrance to the park; the nearest town of Simunye is about 10 kilometers away. Hlane is pronounced approximately like "Shane" (but the sound there is not exactly [sh], but a similar voiceless alveolar lateral spirant)
<p/>

<p>
I saw a wildebeest right at the entrance.
<p/>

<p>
I stayed in a house like this. It costs about $45 per night, clearly cheaper than renting a car (to spend the night not in the park, but to get to the park in the evening/morning). Not to mention the convenience.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537077386_0b435d4893_o.jpg" >
<p>
Everything inside the house is nice, there is also a shower. One problem - no electricity. But you can recharge your phone/laptop near the reception; there is also Wi-fi there, of which 500 megabytes are provided. I couldn't buy a SIM card at the border, so I used Wi-fi.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53536197512_c19cd1d168_o.jpg" >
<p>
There are a lot of antelopes grazing between the houses (these ones are called nyala). They are shy and immediately run away as soon as you make a move in their direction.
<p/>

<p>
There is also a restaurant in the park where you can eat very inexpensively (you can divide by 19 to get dollars).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537398044_89cd082713_o.jpg" >
<p>
I got the meat for $6.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537501240_d30f14bdce_o.jpg" >
<p>
Opposite the restaurant there is a lake where rhinos have come (of course, the area where tourists are is inside the fence).
<p/>

<p>
While I was waiting for the safari to start, I already photographed the rhinoceroses.

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537262098_cd5730c371_o.jpg" >
<p>
The safari costs approximately $25. It is best to take either the evening (before sunset) or the morning one (at dawn), since it is hot during the day and many animals are not particularly active.
<p/>

<p>
We're leaving. Here I was once again glad that I did not rent a car, but arrived on my own. Of course, you can drive along such a road, but it’s not very comfortable, and you won’t always pass each other if someone comes towards you. In addition, not all parts of this park can be visited by yourself - the part where the lions live is separated, and you can only go there with a guide.
<p/>

<p>
The fence looks something like this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537077206_2b451a6794_o.jpg" >
<p>
There are many bare tree trunks around. The guide said it was because they were eaten by elephants.

Zebra. They are quite rare in this park.

<p/>

<p>
There's a whole crowd of giraffes here.

Rhinoceroses were grazing on the other side of the road.

<p>
We drove to another part of the park, and after a while we came across a lion, or rather a lioness.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537057861_1b1e952d1f_o.jpg" >
<p>
Lions sleep 80% of the day, so they are not very active animals. This lioness sleepily rolled on her back.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537076986_70805ceeb4_o.jpg" >
<p>
Then she stood up.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537261738_e8ed1f6ea6_o.jpg" >
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537076866_4f3debc56a_o.jpg" >
<p>
And she fell asleep again.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537397624_1dbb9ef4e3_o.jpg" >
<p>
Sunset.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537047586_43cccd4029_o.jpg" >
<p>
In conclusion, we looked at the third of the big five - the elephant.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537232858_2e3b31aeaa_o.jpg" >
<p>
This park has four of the five - no buffalo. There are leopards, but they are few and far between, and it is very difficult to see them, since they walk mainly at night.

<h2>Manzini</h2>
<p>
In the center of Eswatini is the city of Manzini. This is a typical African market town, where residents of the surrounding lands come to shop. Public transport routes also start from here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537333599_f858128865_o.jpg" >
<p>
In the center of Manzini there are a huge number of shops and shopping centers (for a city with a population of less than 100k).
<p/>

<p>

<p>
I checked into the inexpensive Mozambique Hotel near the bus station. From the window there was a panoramic view of the minibuses.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537197418_e3171d3bb9_o.jpg" >
<p>
Room for $25. There are cheaper rooms without shower, refrigerator and air conditioning for half the price.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537196868_705f78ef36_o.jpg" >
<p>
The hotel had old newspaper clippings on the walls. So the king renamed Swaziland Eswatini. More precisely, he called for using the name from Swazi language in English.

<p>
Eswatini is an absolute monarchy. Besides it, there are only two other monarchies in Africa: <a href="../morocco">Morocco</a> and not far from here, little Lesotho, where you need a visa. In Eswatini, the king still has full power. Many are dissatisfied with this, periodic riots occur, the latest in 2021 with a harsh crackdown on protests and even casualties. The king lives in grand style: he has 15 wives and 36 children. Once a year there is a reed festival (Umhlanga), where very skimpily dressed girls dance. The king periodically selects a new wife from among the participants.

<p>
Finally I bought a local SIM card. SIM card sellers sit on every corner here with big books.
<p/>

<p>
It’s interesting that supermarkets here don’t give you plastic bags. And at the exit there are sellers of bags, offering them for 2 rand.

<p>
Eswatini money is called "lilangeni", the plural is "emalangeni". They are equal to South African rands 1 to 1, so you can pay with rands everywhere, but the coins used here are mainly local ones.

The center of Manzini is on a hill, from which you can see the neighboring hills with residential areas.

The minibuses in Eswatini are very densely packed, and it is considered normal to travel standing.

Albino girl. In Africa, albinism is most common; on average around the world one in 20,000 people is an albino, in Africa it's one in 5,000, and in southern Africa in some regions even 1 in 1,000.

<h2>Mbabane</h2>
<p>
Mbabane is the capital of Eswatini. There is the government here that doesn’t decide much, and the king lives 20 kilometers from the capital, between Mbabane and Manzini.
<p/>

<p>
The road from Manzini to Mbabane is picturesque, Eswatini is quite a hilly country.
