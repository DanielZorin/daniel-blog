<h1>Latvia: Liepaja, Sigulda, Riga</h1>
<i>11-12 October 2016</i>
<h2>Liepaja</h2>
<p>
Liepaja is the third largest city in Latvia on the western edge of the country. It's a three hour drive from Riga. In the summer people come here to the beach, and in the fall the city empties out.
<p/>

<p>
The emptiness here is felt for another reason: since 1991, the population of Liepaja has decreased by 40%. On the street leading from the station, half the houses look abandoned.

The train station and bus station, I just arrived, but everyone had already disappeared somewhere.

And only the tram emerges from the darkness.

<p>
There is a lot of interesting architecture in the center of Liepaja. There are a lot of one- and two-story wooden residential buildings here, in some places it’s reminiscent of the Russian outback, only with the roads in good condition.

At the same time, there are a lot of Western influences.

<p>
Surprisingly, many streets in the center of Liepaja are still paved with cobblestones, which contrasts with the seemingly non-medieval appearance of the city and the 19th century layout with straight streets.

And this is exactly the same as Lithuania or Belarus, they just need to be repainted white.

It seems there was a wooden house here, but it was demolished.

On the outskirts of Liepaja there is a former closed military town of Karosta. The withdrawal of military units from here made a significant contribution to the decrease in the city's population in the 90s. Now this place is publicly accessible, which makes it possible to take a short trip back in time through a semi-abandoned residential area and the remains of fortifications dating back to the times of the Russian Empire.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256361776_84efb81f1c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Before the revolution, Karosta was called Port Alexander III (and Liepaja was called Libava), the border with Germany was close, that’s why fortifications were made. In Soviet times, the military base was built with perfectly recognizable Khrushchev buildings.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256361531_e2375f8b5d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are areas with five-story buildings throughout the Baltic states, including on the outskirts of the capitals, and they are often disadvantaged, so Karosta is not unique in this regard. It looks no worse here than in any other similar area.

Here we are greeted by a surreal picture: the remains of a hundred-year-old fortress are scattered, as if they had been blown away by a hurricane.

Apparently, pieces of walls built near the sea are gradually falling off the embankment and falling into the sea.

Karosta is separated from the rest of Liepaja by a river, across which is a drawbridge like this.

<h2>Sigulda</h2>
<p>
This city in Latvia is quite popular among tourists. It is especially beautiful here in autumn when the leaves turn yellow.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255714483_123313d5c6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The city consists mainly of one-story houses and wide streets. The main street leads to the observation deck.

This time I was passing through, my main goal was to visit Sigulda and Liepaja, so I didn’t really go outside the old city.
