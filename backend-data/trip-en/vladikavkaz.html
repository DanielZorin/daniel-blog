<h1>Russia: Vladikavkaz, Nazran, Magas, Elbrus, Tyrnyauz</h1>
<i>10-13 May 2014</i>
<h2>Vladikavkaz</h2>
<p>
After Grozny, Derbent, Baku, Tbilisi, and even after Magas, Vladikavkaz disappointed me, to put it mildly. The capital of North Ossetia turned out to be a typical Russian provincial city.
<p/>

<p>
The quality of the sidewalks is appalling.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256763985_1c2ed8fef7_o.jpg">
<p>
Not just terrifying, but absolutely nightmarish.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256764180_b5595b2367_o.jpg">
<p>
Apart from the increased concentration of cars and the reduced quality of roads, there is practically no Caucasian flavor in Vladikavkaz.
<p/>

<p>
Except that Ossetian pies are made everywhere in cafes here. This cafe cozily neighbors the funeral home and the nameless hotel without a sign where we lived.
<p/>

<p>
In the remote town N there were so many hairdressing establishments and funeral bureaus that it seemed that the inhabitants of the city were born only to shave, cut their hair, freshen their hair with haircut and immediately die.

<p>
When there is no rain, of course, the city looks better.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254989912_0901ece485_o.jpg">
<p>
The main street is suddenly pedestrianized with shops.
<p/>

<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256469049_efb4aae78e_o.jpg">
<p>
There are several blocks of 19th century Russian-style buildings around.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256469104_20ff35096e_o.jpg">
<p>
The streets are well lit in places.
<p/>

<p>
Flowers are placed at Lenin's feet here.
<p/>

<p>
There is a nice Terek embankment with a Soviet amusement park.
<p/>

Griffins.

<p>
If you turn off the main street, you can end up in a remote place.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254990132_308c480ea0_o.jpg">
<p>
Classic illegal construction.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255922973_ec917fbc64_o.jpg">
<p>
As in many other cities, the old street names are indicated. The house numbers at the nearest intersections are shown, which is very good.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255719911_d62795dd5e_o.jpg">
<p>
Vladikavkaz used to bear the shameful stupid name "Ordzhonikidze". It's good that the old name was returned.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255719061_747371b231_o.jpg">
<p>
The bench is a place for smoking.
<p/>

<p>
There are some interesting slogans in Ossetia.

<p>
What a turn! Artist is the best choice for a girl. And I thought that the best choice was an official or a security officer.
<p/>

Someone goes out of their way to make jokes.

<p>
In Ossetia you need to drive through the mountains. It is quite similar to the southern part of Georgia, you also constantly drive along the bottom of a narrow gorge with a river. A bonus will be the epic rock monument encountered on the road to Tskhinvali.

<h2>Ingushetia</h2>
<p>
Ingushetia has the dubious reputation of being the most dangerous region in Russia. The news from here consists of constant explosions at checkpoints and anti-terrorist special operations. Ingushetia is the only region of Russia that appeared after the collapse of the USSR, and did not have a direct analogue in the RSFSR. When Chechnya decided to secede from Russia, Ingushetia refused, separated from Chechnya with a conditional border, and then managed to fight with neighboring North Ossetia for one of its districts. Think about it: two regions of Russia fought each other for territory!
Now the situation from the point of view of an ordinary tourist is normal. The attacks are aimed at the military and police, but guests are welcome here. The region is actively recovering. Relatively recently, restrictions on movement in Ingushetia were lifted, so now Russian citizens can visit beautiful mountainous areas (you must have documents with you, but FSB permits are no longer required).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255480642_7e038c2664_o.jpg">
<p>
I was in Ingushetia twice: once I drove through it, the second time I visited the capital. I didn’t see a single destroyed house, or even just a poor one like in a typical Russian village. Ingushetia is similar to cottage villages somewhere in Europe. Ingush flags with a recognizable emblem are very popular.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257504489_491fae08ca_o.jpg">
<p>
The largest city in Ingushetia is Nazran, the former capital.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255480602_2f6e62ac6f_o.jpg">
<p>
Nazran is all one-story America.
<p/>

<p>
The capital of Ingushetia is Magas. It is unique in that this city was founded in the 90s as the capital, that is, it is our analogue of cities such as Brasilia, <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/293481.html">Washington</a >, Canberra and Islamabad.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257253245_02ac15c615_o.jpg">
<p>
Magas recently celebrated its 20th anniversary.
<p/>

<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257253555_cc85dfd36a_o.jpg">
<p>
Magas is built in the shape of a square (like <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/254542.html">La Plata</a>), there are no diagonal streets, only longitudinal and transverse ones. The main street is named after Kadyrov.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256958969_530068d662_o.jpg">
<p>
It flows into the alley of the 80th anniversary of Ingushetia.

They have already made an eternal flame.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257253320_933e5d6fa8_o.jpg">
<p>
Smooth, neat streets.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255480902_4067fdf96e_o.jpg">
<p>
Perfect cleanliness.

<p>
On one of the border streets of the square, administrative buildings such as the presidential palace were built.
<p/>

<p>
The parliament building is in the shape of a traditional Ingush tower.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256959863_d03d6fdd72_o.jpg">
<p>
The city is small, about 5,000 people. The infrastructure is all there, several shops and cafes are present.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256410268_a2f0e9d724_o.jpg">
<p>
Even a small amusement park for children.

"- Are you tourists?
- Yes, from Moscow.
- Ah, from Russia! And we are Ingush."
<p/>

<p>
I would come to Ingushetia again to visit the mountainous regions.
<p/>
<h2>Elbrus</h2>
<p>
You can get to the highest peak in Europe by car, instead of walking for a week with tents. Moreover, minibuses go to the foot of the mountain. The surrounding area is built up with small villages with cottages and recreation centers for tourists.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257258124_9bfaf61a9d_o.jpg">
<p>
In the village they even built a house with timber, just like in Austria. The ascent to the top is by cable car, the ticket costs 400 rubles.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256511186_46e78234c0_o.jpg">
<p>
In the first stage you can see the green valley below.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257552995_710f25a5af_o.jpg">
<p>
The first station is at an altitude of 3 kilometers. There's not much there other than transferring to the second stage of the road.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255782927_8ec291f4cc_o.jpg">
<p>
The second section of the cable car goes sideways at an angle of 60 degrees to the first.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256711818_27d7997521_o.jpg">
<p>
Everything is already serious there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257258279_855ae4d753_o.jpg">
<p>
The second station is 3500 meters altitude. There is a cafe here and you can already ski and snowboard.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256511311_27453fa23e_o.jpg">
<p>
The diagram from the official website says that there is a third part of the cable car, travel along which is also included in the ticket. De facto, this is a chair lift, like on the ski slopes. It was not open in May because it was off season, although several people were skiing.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257258424_603e02414e_o.jpg">
<p>
Even on Elbrus there is a memorial in honor of the Great Patriotic War, since there were also battles for the summit.
<p/>

<p>
For 500 rubles for two you can rent a snowmobile to climb even higher, to a height of 3800 meters.

Top of Elbrus.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257258379_1f700f88fe_o.jpg">
<p>
The mountain is located on the border of Kabardino-Balkaria and Karachay-Cherkessia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255783167_e9ab5aa652_o.jpg">
<p>
The top is double, one is slightly higher, the other is slightly lower.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256511541_4bd69fdeb4_o.jpg">
<p>
It turns out to be a hotel with a cafe.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257553370_b938892ed1_o.jpg">
<p>
There are radio masts and some buildings in the mountains, obviously not for tourists.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256712218_652ffcf6bb_o.jpg">
<p>
Light shoes, suitable for walking in sunny Baku and Batumi, were completely unsuitable for hiking through snowdrifts. We warmed up in a cafe near the cable car, fortunately there was a convenient portable heater and tea. All the walls there are also covered with small banknotes.

<h2>Tyrnyauz</h2>
<p>
Tyrnyauz (pronounced TyrnAuz) is the last large settlement before Elbrus.
<p/>
