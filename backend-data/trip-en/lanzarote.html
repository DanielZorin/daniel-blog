<h1>Spain: Las Palmas, Lanzarote</h1>
<i>26-31 October 2018</i>
<h2>Las Palmas</h2>
<p>
The first island in the Canary Islands where I flew was Gran Canaria, where I had already been in <a href="../palmas">2012</a>. Unlike neighboring Lanzarote and Tenerife, which have obvious attractions, on Gran Canaria is not very clear where to go; This is the case when it is better to use a car than public transport. In the end, Las Palmas turned out to be more of a rest stop to gain strength.

Later on the neighboring islands it will be similar, but whiter on Lanzarote and more colorful on Tenerife.

<h2>Lanzarote</h2>
<p>
Lanzarote is the most unusual Canary island. It has the most volcanic activity and the least vegetation, so its landscapes are unique in many ways. Lanzarote is less populated than Tenerife and Gran Canaria, there is only one city, and the northern and western parts of the island consist of natural parks.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257380280_7366790e7b_o.jpg">

<p>
Apparently to contrast with the black earth, almost all the houses in Lanzarote are white.

Large hotel with swimming pool. As you can see, there is not even a semblance of a beach here, the only beach is on the southern edge of the island. But people don’t come here for the beach, of course.

In Lanzarote, public transport is not very suitable for tourists: you can only get to populated areas, but not to most parks and other attractions. So we had to improvise a little. On the first day I was in the southern half of the island, on the second - in the northern. To start, I took the bus that goes to the southern edge of the island and ferries to the neighboring island of Fuerteventura, to the village of Uga, one of the last stops.

There are three roads from Uga: the main Arrecife - southern port, and a branch through the central part of the island to the north, before connecting with the main road from Arrecife to the Timanfaya National Park.

There is just an intersection with the road to the national park. The ticket office is located at the exit from the highway, but from there it’s another 2-3 kilometers to the park’s buildings themselves, which go through fields of lava debris.

The park buildings are located on a slight hill. There is a large car park, a restaurant and a bus stop. Then everyone is equal - you can’t drive through the park by car, everyone gets on a sightseeing bus (the road is narrow, otherwise there would be traffic jams).

Near the tourist center you can see all sorts of experiments. Here they throw a thorn into a volcano.

It’s not difficult to hitchhike from the national park, since many tourists leave there in the evening. We reached the village of Macher, from where you can get to Arrecife by bus.

The next day I went to the northern part of the island to the lava caves. There was no need to walk far because the bus goes straight to them.

The landscape around the caves is something like this; there are almost no mountains here, unlike the southern part of the island, only a rocky field with thorns.

Near the cave there is a second famous attraction - Jameos del Agua. This is also, one might say, a cave, only partially of artificial origin - all sorts of underground rooms on the ocean shore were specially equipped here.
