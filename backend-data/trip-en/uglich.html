The domes of the churches here are blue.

All I knew about Uglich was that the last of the Rurikovich dinasty was killed here. At the site of the death there is a church with blue domes.

Opposite the church, children are playing next to a construction site.

From the reverse side this place looks more picturesque.

The church, by the way, is located in the Kremlin with continuous numbering of houses.

For some reason, there is a strange vehicle in an enclosure in the Kremlin.

<p>
Even stranger vehicles are driving around the Kremlin.

<p>
Tourism is being developed in Uglich, so there are many interesting exhibitions in the city center.
<p/>

<p>
There is also a national Russian one.

The city center is decorated with all sorts of delights. Poster:

The pinnacle of Rococo: the lamppost.

They still haven't managed to clean up outside the center.

The public transport system is completely incomprehensible. You can’t hope to find out the full route, and not just the final stop; this is Russia. But what good is it to me to know the start time of a route if I don’t even know how often the bus runs? Why are some of the numbers written in red? If this is the schedule on Sunday, why is it written somewhere before the regular schedule, and somewhere after? Why does bus 62 have five different schedules, and three more in the summer? It’s good that they left a phone number for inquiries.

<h2>Myshkin</h2>
<p>
Myshkin once looked like this:
<p/>

<p>
It was a village.
<p/>

<p>
But everything changed when tourism began to develop in the city.

<p>
Of course, Myshkin cannot compete in popularity with Paris, but the flow of people from neighboring regions of Russia is enough to prevent the city from falling into disrepair.

In fact, here is now the Russian version of Poble Espanyol in Barcelona or Skansen in Stockholm. On this street there are houses where various traditional crafts are demonstrated: a pottery workshop, a mill, a forge, a weaving shop, a place where felt boots are made.

The highlight is the ubiquitous mice. When the chimes strike, mice come out from behind the shutters.

The old ones are, as usual, black and white.

A nice memorials in honor of the Second World War, without gigantomania.

Well, this restaurant gets the Grand Prix for originality.
