<h1>Hungary: Budapest, Székesfehérvár, Pécs</h1>
<i>2-3 December 2023</i>
<h2>Budapest</h2>
<p>
It's been almost nine years since my last visit to Budapest (and Hungary in general). A convenient option turned up to make a stopover - and here I am on the banks of the Danube.

<p>
Since last time, the metro cars have been repainted white, now they don’t look like the old ones in Moscow.
<p/>

<p>
On another line it is also white.
<p/>

<p>
There are yellow ones left on the oldest line.

<p>
Tickets are still checked by ticket inspectors at the entrance. Now you can buy tickets through the mobile application.

<p>
I ran through the main attractions. There are a lot of tourists, even though it is winter.

The view was obstructed by the fog.

<p>
Monument to the victims of the Holocaust on the banks of the Danube. I haven’t been near it before - you won’t stumble upon it by accident, since the embankment is not a walking one, there is a highway there, you need to go here specifically.

Goulash in bread costs 5,000 forints ($15), cruel.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53399452431_0e8483d979_o.jpg" >
<p>
In general, prices have increased significantly. Budapest is no longer the cheap city I remembered from 2014, when I talked about how everything there was cheaper than Moscow. The dollar to forint exchange rate has increased from 230 to 350 in 9 years, and prices in forints have increased by 2-3 times. For example, I had lunch at the same establishment in 2014. Then the grill menu for two cost 5,500, but now it’s 14,000.

Instead of 100 forints, buns cost 200-300.

<h2>Székesfehérvar</h2>
<p>
Székesfeheravár is one of the easiest destinations to travel from Budapest. The train ride takes less than an hour, but somehow I haven’t gotten here before, although it’s even on the way to Lake Balaton, where I was.
<p/>

The station is about a kilometer from the historical center, the road there goes through panel houses.

Székesfehérvár was the capital of medieval Hungary. In 1543 it was destroyed by the Turks, who captured Hungary for more than 100 years. The foundations of the basilica remain from the ancient city.

There was a different route back to the station, not through the panel houses.

<h2>Pecs</h2>
<p>
Pecs turned out to be one of the most interesting cities in Hungary besides Budapest. There is a lot of beautiful architecture in good condition and even ancient excavations. Perhaps I can recommend it on a par with <a href="../szeged">Szeged</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53399877890_5519b8b41b_o.jpg" >
<p>
The main local attraction is the early Christian burial grounds of the 4th-5th centuries, a World Heritage Site.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53399444546_ec22ee6b64_o.jpg" >
<p>
Inside are the remains of a church with seven choirs (septichora, hence the name).

But the main thing is the crypts with paintings.
<p/>

<p>
It is organized very conveniently - you can look both from the side and from above, while everything is under glass, that is, the frescoes are protected from moisture.

Another burial is a couple of hundred meters from the main one, the ticket is valid. It's under this square.
