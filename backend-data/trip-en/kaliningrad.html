<h1>Russia: Kaliningrad, Curonian Spit, Zelenogradsk, Svetlogorsk</h1>
<i>12-14 August 2013</i>
<h2>Kaliningrad</h2>
<p>
Take off your hats, bare your heads! Now you will see Russia for Russians, made with great love according to the behests of Nikita Khrushchev on the site of a destroyed German city.

<p>
Shock - that was my first impression of Kaliningrad as I walked from the station to the hotel. Of course, I knew that the historical center had not been preserved, but usually in such cases administrative and office buildings of varying degrees of beauty are built in the center. This is what the center looks like here.
<p/>

<p>
In different cities, panel houses have different “decorations”. In Kaliningrad these are squares.

The Lenin Monument is a cultural heritage site, that's how it is!

Hammers and sickles were built into the bridge fence.

<p>
In the middle of all this stands a monument to the era of stagnation - the house of the Soviets, nicknamed "The Monster". The building was never used for its intended purpose and has been abandoned behind a fence for many years. This, by the way, is the main square in the city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256989009_dfce574476_o.jpg">
<p>
There is also a cathedral in the center. There were some gopniks standing at the entrance, who explained to me that the entrance to the island was closed because of the festival.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256241966_eb475e44e1_o.jpg">
<p>
I had to return a few hours later and buy a ticket to see the cathedral and honor the memory of Immanuel Kant. It must be said that the cathedral was actually built anew; the construction date on the weather vane is 1998.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256242586_7e14263f8a_o.jpg">
<p>
Such inclusions of preserved buildings occur from time to time. Well, the gate was restored (but several other gates, not so much).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256242056_0057f2cdf3_o.jpg">
<p>
Here is another building that is clearly German, next to the northern station.

Some old buildings are in poor condition.

<p>
Since German times, the numbering of doors instead of houses has been preserved here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256241681_39bca434c5_o.jpg">
<p>
And also many streets are paved with cobblestones, which is not typical for Russia.
<p/>

<p>
The government of Kaliningrad has proclaimed a grandiose goal - to completely rebuild the historical city center in the German style. There is apparently not enough funding for such an ambitious project, although the Kaliningrad region is one of the richest in Russia. So far there is only one row of houses, called the "Fishermen's village". It's to the right of the cathedral and the Monster.
<p/>

Shawarma is already sold in German houses.

<p>
Soviet buildings and oil paintings shine through the German houses.
<p/>

<p>
At this point, the reader might think that Kaliningrad is an endless soviet hole, but the whole point is that this is not so! Kaliningrad is a mix. Well, like Uzbek and Japanese cuisines combined.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255511522_a669c1b521_o.jpg">
<p>
The fact is that old Kaliningrad has still been preserved a little. In two whole pieces: Amalienau and Maraunenhof.
<p/>

<p>
This is where you should walk for pleasure, and explore the center point by point.
<p/>

<p>
Here, new houses are built in a similar style.

Somewhere at that moment another downpour began, which drove me to a restaurant that turned out to be an analogue of McDonald's, only cheaper.

<p>
In general, Kaliningrad still commands the parade. <i>The signs says: "How do you buy your girlfriend a house if you don't command the parade? Go to Forex!"</i>

<h2>Curonian Spit</h2>
<p>
Like any large natural park, the Curonian Spit is not very suitable for exploration without a car or a tour bus, but it is nevertheless possible. From Kaliningrad there are buses to Morskoye, the last village before the Lithuanian border. This way you can get to the farthest point in the Russian part of the Curonian Spit.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257085440_c182685eea_o.jpg">
<p>
The Curonian Spit is a very long and narrow peninsula. Part of it belongs to Lithuania; this piece is formally an exclave, since you can only get there from Lithuanian territory by ferry. I haven’t been to the Lithuanian side, I didn’t even take my passport with me, since you can’t cross the border on foot, and there’s almost no transport on either side of the border. In addition to the car, there is another option to ride a bicycle. So, I got off the bus in Morskoye. The weather was not favorable. It wasn't raining very hard, the ground was wet, and there was no one on the streets with fashionable half-timbered houses.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256041076_9bffcc8086_o.jpg">
<p>
I left the village and climbed over the dune to the beach. Of course, there were no other such daredevils; the beach was entirely mine, along with all the cold water of the Baltic Sea.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256241593_f57aef45bb_o.jpg">
<p>
I looked at my wet boots and walked back.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256041166_ca6709b1ef_o.jpg">
<p>
There was nothing to do, I walked along the empty road to the nearest attraction - the height of Efa. The walk is four kilometers. From time to time along the road there are strange red barrier structures, apparently preventing people from entering the clearing by car.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255311517_1f2af115e2_o.jpg">
<p>
When I reached the height of Efa and began to think about how to dry my boots, the rain stopped. It was possible to go. Passage in this part of the park is along the footbridge.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256041261_040536c61d_o.jpg">
<p>
The place is beautiful. All the beaches on the Baltic are quite similar, with the same forests just beyond the sand line.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256789539_c3dff5f9e4_o.jpg">
<p>
A similar picture can be seen in Estonia (Ust-Narva), Latvia (<a href="../latvia">Jurmala</a>), Russia (<a href="../vyborg">Sestroretsk</a>).

<p>
In the distance you can see the sea.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257085400_69664b0511_o.jpg">
<p>
On the other side, there is again a beach near the seashore (not the bay), you can go out and admire it.
<p/>

<p>
I missed the bus, and the next one was not coming soon, so I made a strong-willed decision, despite my wet boots, to walk to the next attraction - the Dancing Forest. Distance - eight kilometers. The whole drive is absolutely equally depressing - the road through the forest. The exact same picture can be seen in South America or Australia. I don’t understand people who like to drive for hours through forests and fields.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256241938_373dbf8afd_o.jpg">
<p>
In order not to go crazy from boredom, I counted my steps and noted the time, thus measuring my speed using kilometer posts. It turned out that I was walking at a speed of about 5.5 kilometers per hour.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255311797_fdf9435a8b_o.jpg">
<p>
Dancing forest. Due to special winds, tree trunks in a small area are bent in a bizarre way.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255311837_7ba05d5afe_o.jpg">
<p>
The most interesting trees were prudently fenced off from those who like to take pictures, despite the fact that visitors already walk along the walkways, fenced off on both sides.
<p/>

<p>
And finally, I got to the bus. I seemed to have seen the most interesting places on the Curonian Spit; only the initial part remained uncovered.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256242093_d9548121ff_o.jpg">
<p>
It’s interesting that in the Kaliningrad region on suburban buses, where the price depends on where you’re going from and to, tickets are rolled out exactly at the price you pay. From the trip to Morskoye and back to Zelenogradsk I had a whole set of tickets of different denominations.
<p/>

<h2>Zelenogradsk</h2>
<p>
Zelenogradsk (Kranz) is also a German city. It's trying to take advantage of it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255771916_28311a4094_o.jpg">

<p>
It doesn't always work out.

A fine of 1000 rubles does not scare anyone.
<p/>

<p>
There is not much of a resort in Zelenogradsk; the beach is rocky and narrow.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255772186_11f5c408a8_o.jpg">
<p>
But in Zelenogradsk there is an excellent figure at the entrance to the bus station, the first thing that catches your eye.

<h2>Svetlogorsk</h2>
<p>
Svetlogorsk is a former seaside resort. Now the beach has almost been washed away, and the city has turned into a forest resort.
