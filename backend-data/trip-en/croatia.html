<h1>Croatia: Zagreb, Rijeka, Opatija, Pula, Rovinj, Zadar, Split, Durbovnik</h1>

<h2>Zagreb</h2>
<p>
I have already <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/305507.html">written about the history of Croatia</a>. The most interesting events there took place in remote corners of the country, which are far from tourist centers. The capital of Croatia is also not a popular destination because it is located far from the sea. Although there is nothing special in Zagreb, I liked the city. It looks like other cities of the good old Austria-Hungary, and due to its capital status, it has business atmosphere.

<p>
The new city center with the station and administrative buildings looks as if it were designed in the USSR - it’s rare to see such a grid of streets and wide avenues anywhere in Europe. In <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/320666.html">Turin</a> the avenues are narrower. In reality, this area, of course, is older than the state of Yugoslavia, because there are buildings here that were built in the 19th century.

Typical Europe. If someone showed me this photo, I would assume that it is somewhere in Germany, the tiles are very similar.

Whoever came up with the Croatian coat of arms many centuries ago was a true master of design and branding. This is one of the most recognizable national symbols in the world.

On the hill there is an old town with narrow streets.

<p>
And this is what a typical Zagreb yard looks like. I rented an apartment in this house, this photo was taken from the entrance porch. On the left are windows with nine sections and broken glass - these are the windows on the stairs. The place looks like a typical entrance to a Moscow or St. Petersburg pre-war house that has not seen renovation for a very long time.
<p/>

<h2>Rijeka</h2>
<p>
The city of Rijeka greatly disappointed me, perhaps because I expected more from it than from Zagreb. Rijeka has a rather epic history: after the collapse of Austria-Hungary, it was claimed by Italy and Yugoslavia. While they were negotiating, the Italian poet Gabriele d'Annuzio staged a putsch in Rijeka and seized power. When the League of Nations decided to make Rijeka an independent state like <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/281976.html">Danzig</a>, he created the Republic of Fiume there and declared war on Italy, but lost. A few years later, the artificial “free city of Fiume” was annexed to Italy. "Rijeka" and "Fiume" mean "river" in Croatian and Italian respectively.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256890838_33f1f99da7_o.jpg">
<p>
I expected to see an Italian city, and in a sense that's what I saw.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256890898_1d5c17fbd8_o.jpg">
<p>
Although the Italian city consists of one and a half streets.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256890863_f5d6f64d86_o.jpg">
<p>
There is a little bit of Genoa.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256690276_16b8ae6c72_o.jpg">
<p>
The most important difference between Rijeka and any Italian city is that there is no life here at all. Can you imagine the main street in Italy on a Sunday evening looking like this?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256690046_a3e2ff73d8_o.jpg">
<p>
What an Italian city looks like on Sunday is described in my <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/320666.html">story about Turin</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257856815_e569b2c4f3_o.jpg">
<p>
So the only Italian street signs here are.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255961617_34e0c84479_o.jpg">
<p>
The border between Italy and Yugoslavia ran right along the river here until 1943. Now this is the city center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257732585_55bf9094b0_o.jpg">
<p>
There is a long staircase leading up the hill.

I wonder who decided to decorate the panorama of Rijeka with <i>this</i>?
<p/>

<h2>Opatija</h2>
<p>
There is no beach in Rijeka, only a port, so all the tourists hang out in neighboring Opatija, creating a buzz there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256795998_664ee33635_o.jpg">

In terms of the sophistication of the villas, this place is reminiscent of <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/315231.html">Nice</a>.

<h2>Pula</h2>
<p>
In Pula, a Colosseum remains from the Romans. Entrance costs around $20, although everything is visible from the outside and you can walk around it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257417269_edd57de2bf_o.jpg">

This part of Croatia is former Italy. Many inscriptions are duplicated in Italian.

Well, you can see everything right away from the shutters.

The central street was decorated with umbrellas.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255942567_0741100f69_o.jpg">
<p>
There is already a typical resort atmosphere here, the entire street consists of souvenir shops, although there is no beach in the city center, there is a port.

<h2>Rovinj</h2>
<p>
Perhaps the most beautiful city I have seen in Croatia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256127929_ed96ba613c_o.jpg">
<p>
Like all other cities on the Croatian and Montenegrin coasts, it was built by Venice.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256819981_860a193e45_o.jpg">
<p>
Oddly enough, there aren’t that many people walking the streets.

As in other Balkan countries, obituaries are posted here. In Rovinj there are special boards for such sheets so that they are not hung on trees or drainpipes.

<h2>Zadar</h2>
<p>
One thing really surprised me about Croatia. Here, just like on the Russian and Ukrainian coasts of the Black Sea, old ladies who rent out rooms to vacationers meet you at the station. You don’t have to book accommodation in the coastal cities of Croatia, since there may be very few offers on Booking.com, or they are located inconveniently, and at the station you can always rent a room for 20 euros for one person or for 30 euros for two people.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256517929_da071893f5_o.jpg">
<p>
Zadar was a semi-exclave of Italy in Yugoslavia between the world wars. The Venetian tower also stands here.

They made an original thing on the beach - a “sea organ”. There are holes in the tiles; if you put your ear to it, you can hear the sounds created by the waves crashing against the rocks. A little like the sound in a sea shell, only in the shell it is monotonous, but here it turns out to be a symphony.
<p/>

I moved into an apartment on the top floor, which had access to the roof. A very good place.

The city center is straight ahead. Here the old city is not round, as usual, but square, because it stands inside the walls of Diocletian's palace.

Everyone hid inside Diocletian's palace, which was turned into a large souvenir shop.

The narrowest streets are not in the very center, but a little further away, on the hill.

<h2>Dubrovnik</h2>
<p>
Initially, my expectations from Dubrovnik were worse than ever. I expected to see a plastic amusement park, and something like this:
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256274018_2ace5eff10_o.jpg">
<p>
In general, this is approximately what I saw. On the main street. Let's say thank you to the liner parked at the port.
<p/>

The natives, apparently, left Dubrovnik.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256010882_3cb49daa93_o.jpg">
<p>
Almost all housing in the center is either for rent or closed.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257781600_33889ce94d_o.jpg">
<p>
Oddly enough, there are a lot of places here that are incomprehensibly abandoned despite high demand for tourist rentals.

Some ruins and a landfill right under the fortress wall.

A broken basketball hoop, that's what I didn't expect to see here.

On the other side of the city there is a functioning sports ground at a high altitude, above the roofs of houses.

Dubrovnik was bombed by the Serbs in 1992-1995, but judging by this map, quite little was destroyed (these are the red rectangles). Triangles and dots indicate broken roofs and pavements.

In general, Dubrovnik turned out to be no better and no worse than other cities in Croatia. There are only slightly more tourists here than usual. I also didn’t notice the particularly high prices that I was warned about in all previous cities. The room costs the same 30 euros, even cheaper than in Zagreb and Rijeka, where there are fewer options.

In some places in the old town there is life, clothes are dried.

For some reason, there are a lot of clothesline hooks in Dubrovnik, more than in other cities.

Mailbox, with an inscription in Italian. Dubrovnik is also a Venetian colony (Ragusa).

The old town with narrow streets extends a little further than the fortress walls, but not very far.

You can swim right next to the fortress.

Although, apparently, no one really swims in Dubrovnik, everyone only comes here on excursions. The beach is empty.

In a big hotel, everyone obviously hangs out in the pool. It would be too much for me to go down the stone stairs to swim in the sea.

In Dubrovnik there is a cable-stayed bridge, similar to half of the Russian Bridge in <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/317872.html">Vladivostok</a>. It is named after Franjo Tudjman.

Well, and a completely incredible detail for Dubrovnik - a stall, just like in the nineties, with bars on the windows (it would seem that it’s calm here?). And even the old school Pepsi logo is present.
