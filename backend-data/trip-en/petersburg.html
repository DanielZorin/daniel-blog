<h1>Russia: Saint Petersburg, Kronstadt</h1>
<i>19-20 August 2012</i>
<h2>Saint Petersburg</h2>
<p>
I have been to St. Petersburg three times: eleven, ten and nine years ago. During those three visits I visited all the major palaces and museums, so this time I wanted to explore the streets. I managed to make a big circle. From Ladozhsky Station through Okhta to the Alexander Nevsky Lavra, then straight along Nevsky Prospekt from one end to the other, along the embankment to Dekabristov Square, across the bridge to Vasilyevsky Island (where I lived), further to the Petrogradskaya Side, again across the bridge to the Finlyandsky Station , back to the left side of the Neva, to Peski, and to the Moskovsky station. The length turned out to be only about 20 kilometers. The second walk took place in the center in the area of Fontanka, Summer Garden, embankment near the Winter Palace and Strelka.

<p>
On old street signs, an arrow shows the direction of house numbering. It would be even more convenient if the numbers of houses at the nearest intersections were indicated, as in Stockholm.
<p/>

<p>
The new signs, somewhat similar in shape to the ones in Paris, also have this.
<p/>

<p>
A very rare specimen, house six <i>letter</i> B, and there is even a flashlight for illumination at night.

<p>
Place for your advertisement at the bottom of the index. On the other I saw the inscription “May”, on the third there was nothing written.
<p/>

<p>
Antique stylized pointer. On the right you can see where the old blue sign was removed.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254665182_f6e15e4491_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Each bridge also has a sign attached to a cast post.
<p/>

<p>
There is a huge amount of social advertising posted around the city (almost like in Minsk). Here is an advertisement in the style of Soviet posters from the Civil War.
<p/>

<p>
Schoolchildren are taught not to go to clubs and to observe curfews. It’s also probably forbidden to gather in groups of three, so as not to violate the law on rallies.
<p/>

<p>
Numerous posters threaten fines for illegal parking. It seems that, as in Moscow, in reality no one is particularly fined.
<p/>

<p>
Elegant columns with billboards.
<p/>

<p>
The most interesting advertisements are hung on the walls. <i>Looking for a man...</i>
<p/>

<p>
Trade in hotel checks is thriving in St. Petersburg. People who come here on a business trip are given counterfeit checks from an expensive hotel like Astoria, and they themselves live in cheap hotels, making a profit from their employers. Judging by the different numbers on the ads, there are even several competing organizations.
<p/>

<p>
Another witty ad. <i>Don't repeat his mistake - he tried to reload the printer cartridge on his own</i>
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255391561_01aefbf245_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A witty message on the asphalt. <i>Beys, I am pregnant! - Bye bye then!</i>
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255417241_81825f3f2e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Viral advertising on asphalt. I must say, the authors did interest me, so I went to the site.

Best recruiting ad. This would be at McDonald's! <i>Are you addicted to huge salaries? Come join us!</i>

<p>
At each front door there is a sign that tells you which apartment is on which floor.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256143729_a81d340541_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are also advanced front doors, with a list of all residents and a bell with a string.
<p/>

<p>
The main stereotype of foreigners about Russia is not matryoshka dolls, balalaikas and bears, and not even the KGB, but the fact that crowds of Nazis supposedly walk the streets here, and any non-white person will immediately be sent to the gas chamber. As you can see, even in highly cultural St. Petersburg there really are such elements, although their number is exaggerated on Fox News.
<p/>

The story about the plaques would be incomplete without memorial plaques about Lenin.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256461520_4f1da2f5f4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Well, without the most famous inscription in St. Petersburg. <i>"This side of the street is more dangerous during shelling". The sign is kept from WW2 times.</i>
<p/>

Very few cities can compare with St. Petersburg in terms of colorful streets (only Madrid and Moscow come to mind right off the bat). Last time I collected street signs into a collection, and now we’ll talk about everything else.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255397081_acf49645de_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The cleanest and quietest streets are on Vasilyevsky Island. The reason is that there are few cars there, since they have nowhere to go through this island (except for the patch around Strelka).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255396671_5e7f331f95_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The front doors are at least a hundred years old. There are very few of these in Moscow, even in the center. I had the opportunity to live for a couple of days in a similar house in Riga.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255396701_421f98d817_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The Petrogradsky district seemed to me the darkest of the central districts of St. Petersburg. Perhaps it's due to the cloudy weather. Among the houses, the creation of the Imatra Homeowners Association stood out. It turned out that in St. Petersburg there are HOAs everywhere, which, alas, I can only dream of in Moscow.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256440665_b5a73597f1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also a UFO here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256440935_f6a0fb9d60_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Finland Station is the most progressive, its name is duplicated in English. There is something like this in Moscow too, but oddly enough, at the Savelovsky station.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255417096_91c6899c22_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Somewhere nearby there is a balcony from which the leader of the world proletariat bewitched the workers and peasants.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255600758_2500301c24_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In this area there are even Soviet panels on houses a la Minsk.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256461490_b92191109d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A bus passed me, smoking as if it had been hit.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256164339_e4fa97d0bd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And then one car slightly touched another, and despite the low speed, it overturned, strewing the road with glass shards. Fortunately, the driver escaped with scratches and minor fear.
<p/>

<p>
In the Peski area, the houses are so old that each one has a warning on it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254685982_ea3ffa4714_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Typical house.
<p/>

<p>
A walk around the city would be incomplete without a visit to the complete outskirts. Unfortunately, I didn’t find anything impressive there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256164734_bd5c7e9c3a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I was sure that the stadium where Zenit plays is on Kirov Island. It turned out that it was on the Petrograd side.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254664897_50fc8aa517_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It turned out that you can take photographs in the St. Petersburg metro. It also turned out that there are doors in front of the train entrance only at stations in the center; there are none on the outskirts.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254686042_fa1a0c0fb8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And at the Sportivnaya metro station there is a two-story platform, and trains approach only from one side, but on the lower floors. There aren't even rails on the other side.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255417406_6e8bd2442a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It also turned out that since my last visit, entrance to the Summer Garden has been made free.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255621533_73d36e1209_h.jpg"/>
<p>
For the first time in Russia I saw bags for dogs on the street. There are such boxes in Moscow parks, but there have never been any packages in them.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256440680_a1bfa6a9de_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are arrows on pedestrian crossings indicating which way to go.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256430955_e20f054c30_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Traffic lights show time in minutes and seconds. So the time limit is 9 minutes 59 seconds.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256133999_4661f9849e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Traffic lights can be switched using buttons.

Umbrella vending machine. For absolute success, this idea lacks one thing - mass appeal.
<p/>

<p>
Trash cans in the shape of a cupcake. I tried for a long time to remember where else I had seen these, I even looked through some old photographs, but I couldn’t find them.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255396616_9192526084_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the Primorsky district there are branded urns with a logo.
<p/>

<p>
Adequate bus schedule. A route map is not enough to achieve complete happiness.
<p/>

<p>
In St. Petersburg they read newspapers on stands! The variety is impressive: even publications with a dubious reputation are displayed.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256461655_f1421b2ae3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The monument to Chizhik-Pyzhik (hero of a student song) is in place, which means everything in this world is in order.

<h2>Kronstadt</h2>
<p>
Oddly enough, formally Kronstadt is a district of St. Petersburg. In light of this fact, the sad state of local houses can be explained by the fact that de jure this is a distant outskirts.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257047444_a90d3b14e3_h.jpg"/>

<p>
On the other hand, wooden windows and small balconies without a fence give the city a certain charm.
<p/>

<p>
You just need to patch up the peeling paint.
<p/>

<p>
The sign with the list of apartments is lamp-based, wooden.
<p/>

Some stopped halfway.

<p>
The contrast is clearly visible in the local central park. Here is a view of the main cathedral overlooking the pond.

<p>
The island is heavily fortified. Along one bank there are fortress walls.
<p/>

<p>
Along the other are cannons.

<p>
On the main square, heavy, epic poems are engraved on the eternal flame.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257047219_f9faf26717_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On the outskirts there is a completely surreal monument. <lj user="the_ink_spot"> and I decided that we were talking about the events from the Soviet cartoon about the Cossacks, but it turned out that in 1656 there really was one of the Russian-Swedish wars here, and cossacks participated in it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255570212_67fb559ba1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Along the wall at the head of the square hangs an unreal number of memorial plaques commemorating soldiers of different wars.
<p/>

<p>
On the other side there are some barracks.

There are microscopic islands scattered around in the sea, on which there are fortifications. If it had been warmer, we could have taken a boat to see what was there.
<p/>

Moreover, there is a beach. And even with working wi-fi.
