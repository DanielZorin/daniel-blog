<h1>South Korea: Jeju, Busan, Gyeongju, Daegu</h1>
<i>23 May - 5 June 2015</i>
<h2>Jeju</h2>
<p>
So, after almost three months in China, I flew to Korea on a Shanghai-Jeju flight. Staying in one country for such a long time was my first experience of this kind. Previously, I rarely spent more than a week at a time in one country, especially in small European countries, and this is usually not enough to get to know how the country works. When you book hotels on the Internet (because you arrive late in the evening and don’t want to search on the spot), you don’t see the entire market. With a busy schedule, you don’t always find the best prices in supermarkets, and the cheapest restaurants pass you by. When you have little time, you take the fastest transport, not the cheapest. If you are visiting for a few days, there is no point in buying a local SIM card or learning the language.
I know how the system works in China: how to read the menu in a canteen, how to find out the right bus route, how to bargain in a hotel. Now I had to figure out how to do all this in Korea.

<p>
Korea is considered a high-tech country, almost like Japan: LG, Samsung and so on. The biggest technological innovation I found there was the Jeju Airport toilet with remote control. Then they never met again. Internet in Korea is a little worse than in China, and more expensive, on the other hand, nothing is blocked.
<p/>

<p>
At the airport there was a very fashionable, bright traffic controller.

<p>
After China, Korea seems like a village, which is surprising, because the population density in Korea is higher than in China! If you exclude island microstates, only two countries have higher densities: Bangladesh and Taiwan. Only five regions in China have higher population densities.

This is what the central square of Jeju, the capital of the region, looks like.
<p/>

<p>
There are a couple of streets with shops in the center.
<p/>

Lots of modern art.

Korea is most similar to <a href="../los-angeles">USA</a>

<p>
Most hotels here are also called motels. Korean motels are easily recognized by their logo, which looks like a smoking cauldron. At the same time, in terms of design, Korean motels are ordinary hotels; many do not even have parking for cars (although there are also real motels, where on the ground floor there is a drive-in for cars directly to the reception).
On the first day, I walked around the city for a very long time, studying all these motels, but there was nothing cheaper than 30,000 won (about 27 dollars) in Jeju.
<p/>

<p>
All Korean cities were built a maximum of 50 years ago. There is nothing like <a href="../tianjin">Pingyao</a> or old European cities in Korea. There was no cultural revolution here, but the Japanese occupation from the beginning of the 20th century, the careless attitude of the occupiers towards the culture of Korea, and the Korean War of 1950-1953 were merciless, so the antiquities are represented mainly by individual temples or palaces, and one can only guess about the historical layout of cities , seeing the ring road on the map.

There is one such complex in Jeju - the governor's residence. One day a small festival was held there.

English in Korea is better than in China, but still not very good. Korean language has no relatives. It has the same complex politeness system as Japanese, and a lot of borrowings from Chinese. Previously, Koreans wrote in hieroglyphs, so knowing Chinese, one could understand a lot, but now the alphabet is used, and it is difficult to guess by sound. For example, "Jeju", written in hieroglyphs, would be read in Chinese as "Jizhou", and the last character on this tablet ("hall") is "guan" in Chinese, and "kwan" in Korean.
<p/>

<p>
The Korean alphabet is the easiest to remember. It has fewer letters than Latin, but similar sounds correspond to similar letters. Thus, simple and aspirated consonants (in English transliteration they correspond to voiceless/voiced ones) always differ in that aspirates have an additional horizontal line. Some signs still use the old version of the English transliteration (in the new one it will be written as Sam Seong Hyeol)

Religion in Korea is a strange mixture of Buddhism...
<p/>

...and paganism.

<p>
The food in Korea is interesting, but it requires getting used to. At first you will be shocked by the prices in the store.
<p/>

<p>
If you think that the market is better, you are mistaken. It's even more expensive there.
<p/>

<p>
In general, since we are in Korea, the homeland of Doshirak noodles (most common nodles in Russia), we need to try it! It’s really called “Dosirak” in Korean, it costs 730 won - about 4 yuan, i.e. like in China. "Dosirak" is far from the most popular brand in Korea; it is rarely found and is mainly found in large supermarkets. On the left side of this photo is the "Cheese bokki" noodles, which I absolutely wholeheartedly recommend - they are the most delicious instant noodles in the world.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256227886_13ca4a3bbe_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But while Korea is the home of doshirak, it is actually a seafood country. It was in Korea, where potatoes cost $5 per kilogram, that I ate lobsters several times, which in all other countries, even the cheap countries of Southeast Asia, are prohibitively expensive. Two lobsters cost $15, and if you wait until 9 pm, the price can be reduced to $10.
<p/>

Shrimp and scallops are quite cheap.
<p/>

<p>
On our last day on the island, we specially checked into a hostel (a bed costs 15,000 won, i.e. a hotel for two costs the same) to use the kitchen.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257269920_6ed8d1cb43_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You can also eat in restaurants, for example, an inexpensive establishment. Bibimbap for 3500.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255496937_56477a42ba_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The peculiarity of Korean restaurants is that even the cheapest ones provide an unlimited number of snacks for any dish, for example, spicy kimchi cabbage. In this photo, rolls and dumplings were ordered, for a total of 4 dollars.

Maybe vegetable gardens are popular in Jeju because of the expensive vegetables and fruits?

And Jeju is, first of all, an island of volcanoes and one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New7Wonders_of_Nature">seven wonders of nature</a>.

Jeju Island is interesting primarily for its volcanic rocks and caves. For the Koreans themselves, this is also the beach part of the country. But the climate in Korea is not very warm, you can only relax on the beach for a couple of months a year, and it’s cold in May-June. The island is small, you can go around it in a circle on a local bus, which stops in every village, in about three hours. There are two cities - Jeju on the northern coast of the island and Seogwipo on the southern coast. Jeju has government, airport, shops and motels, Seogwipo has a football stadium (used for the 2002 World Cup) and beach resorts. Traveling by bus is quite convenient: there are two routes from Jeju to Seogwipo along the coast, one along the eastern half of the island, the second along the western, as well as several routes through the center, on which you can get from one city to another much faster, and you can also get off in the middle near Mount Halla.

<p>
From Seogwipo we took a bus to the western edge of the island, where the volcanic rocks are, because this place looked so beautiful in the photos from the tourist map of the island.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257268990_f2dffd102a_h.jpg"/>

From the village where the bus stops, you still need to walk a couple of kilometers along the fields.

The stones on the seashore are pumice, which is used to rub calluses. These stones are sold in all souvenir shops here, but you can also find them on the ground.

In the eastern part of the island there is a lava cave. There are actually a lot of caves, they stretch for kilometers under the island, but only a small part is open to the public. Some have been explored, but you can’t just enter them, the entrance is locked.
<p/>

What’s nice about Korea is that entrance to all attractions is inexpensive, 2-3 dollars.

In the center of the island rises Mount Halla - the volcano that created Jeju a million years ago.
<p/>

<p>
There are five hiking routes on the mountain: two from the west, two from the east and one from the south. At the same time, the crater itself can only be approached from the east; this is the most difficult path for about five hours. The western and southern routes connect at the base of the crater. I arrived at the mountain a little late, but managed to go up one western route and down another.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256426733_fcc08e70c7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The climb is not very difficult, it takes about an hour and a half. Mostly stairs.
<p/>

<p>
It must be said that the Koreans somehow take this climb (and many other hikes too) too seriously. Many go in special suits and with poles, although the climb is quite simple and can be done in the most ordinary shoes.

<h2>Busan</h2>
<p>
Busan is the second largest and most picturesque city in Korea.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255978576_6f0aee8de2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I flew from Jeju Island to Busan Airport. The ticket was inexpensive, about 30 dollars. At first I wanted to buy a ticket to the city of Gwangju, since the route through mainland Korea would be more logical, and the tickets would be several dollars cheaper, but I was unable to buy a ticket from the airline that flew to Gwangju, the site did not accept my American card. It was possible to go by ferry, the money would be about the same, and it would take three hours to sail to the nearest port. But I decided otherwise.
There are chic suitcase-shaped trash cans at Busan Airport.

In Gyeongju itself, the most must-see place is Anapchi Pond. This is the only place with an entrance fee, but for such beauty, $2 is not much.

Boarding on buses in Korea is interesting: you need to scan your ticket with a code with the device near the driver, then your seat will light up on the screen. You can immediately see how many passengers are already on the bus.

<h2>Daegu</h2>
<p>
Daegu is the fourth largest city in Korea, after Seoul, Busan and Incheon (a suburb of Seoul). The city is not touristic at all, there is no sea or any famous places. I spent two days in Daegu.
<p/>

<p>
An ordinary street consists of low houses with a huge number of signs.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255312787_7e116327e4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A little further there will be areas with multi-storey buildings, similar to Moscow. In Korea, house numbers are always written in huge numbers on the side.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256042531_ad724514a1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Looking at the map, you can guess that Daegu was once a medieval city surrounded by a fortress wall, but now the center looks like this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256042646_ef9411e1fb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The street layout has been preserved; in some places there are replica gates at the entrances.

<p>
One antique area was still found. I didn’t find any information about this place, so most likely these are former slums that have now become civilized one-story houses, but they didn’t have time to replace them with apartment buildings.
<p/>

<p>
I settled near a relatively small bus station, where the bus arrived from Gyeongju. Across the street was the giant Daegu East Train Station, where the high-speed trains from Seoul to Busan stop. The station area is packed to capacity with motels.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256936048_58b897ecb6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are so many motels not because Daegu is a tourism center, but because Koreans need somewhere to meet in private.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256935983_fde964969d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Motels have more expensive rooms with round beds and mirrors on the ceiling, but this is too much luxury. A cozy room with a cooler for 25,000 won ($23) was quite enough for me. The TV had porn channels.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256042341_d5d570f221_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The porn they showed there was very funny. Like the Japanese porn, it was censored, but not with the blurred squares, but by the composition of the frame itself: the angle was always such that the genitals were not visible.
<p/>

<p>
Because of this, actors mostly have sex with their clothes on. At the same time, they moan so picturesquely (men are even louder than women) that doubt arises whether the process really takes place, or is it also imitated?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257086265_a0b41dcd02_h.jpg"/>
<p>
After some time, they started showing porn in historical settings.
<p/>

<p>
In addition to motels, there are many "business clubs" in the area for warming up.
<p/>

In general, the fashion industry in Korea is very developed, local clothes are very stylish.

There are more than a million people in Daegu, there is a subway, although I have never used it.

Daegu is a very Christian city. I didn’t find a single Buddhist temple in the center, but a bunch of churches.
