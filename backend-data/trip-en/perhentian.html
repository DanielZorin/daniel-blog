<h1>Malaysia: Kuala Lumpur, Kuantan, Kuala Terengganu, Perhentian Islands</h1>
<i>11-20 June 2017</i>
<h2>Kuala Lumpur</h2>
<p>
From the hell I flew straight to heaven, to my favorite city of Kuala Lumpur. To start, I ate a juicy beef burger, making up for the whole of India.

We went to a familiar place for a durian buffet, but it was not the season and they didn’t have a buffet. I had to buy it by weight, not cheap.

<p>
Since my last visit to KL, a continuation of the pink metro line has been opened here, about 20 new stations. Just a couple of stations from the durian buffet a new section began, so I went for a ride.
<p/>

The metro is automatic, you can stand at the windshield the whole way.

At this very distant station, the ends of the pink and yellow lines meet, so from here you can get to the center in two ways.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256506493_0e777cdc24_o.jpg">

And the place for the final station is just typical provincial Malaysia, literally a couple of rows of houses with shops.

<h2>Kuantan</h2>
<p>
Kuantan is the capital of the state of Pahang, which I have already been to in <a href="../malacca">other places</a>. Kuantan is on the east coast, it takes about 4 hours to get from KL. The bus station is huge, but quite close to the center.

<h2>Kuala Terengganu</h2>
<p>
Kuala Terengganu is the last state capital of Malaysia that remained unvisited by me. It is the capital of the state of Terengganu, which includes the Perhentian Islands.

<h2>Perhentian Islands</h2>
<p>
The question of where to go on holiday in Malaysia after KL was not even raised - of course, to the Perhentian Islands, to the best beaches (there are no beaches in India, so this is the only place you can recoup).
<p/>

<p>
The hotel where I stayed last time for 60 ringit has doubled in price. Perhaps the reason is that back then March was the very beginning of the season, and now June was the peak. In the end, I settled in these bungalows on White Beach for 90 ringit, but with air conditioning. Though, the air conditioner only worked from 8 pm to 8 am, which served as a good replacement for the alarm clock - I woke up from the onset of the heat.

<p>
But nothing prevents you from going a little north from Coral Bay, it is still quite empty there.

It's still cheaper there than on the beaches.

I was surprised that there are motorcycles in the village, although from one end to the other there is at most a kilometer, and there are no roads beyond that yet.

<p>
I reached the only beach on Small Island that I hadn’t been to last time - Romantic beach. To get here, you need to find a barely noticeable path in the jungle and go down a rather steep slope. But few people come here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256630046_ab8b72a53a_o.jpg">
<p>
But after lunch boats can bring people here on excursions or just as taxi.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255901227_7d459dd860_o.jpg">
<p>
So perhaps the most secluded beach is not this one, but Isabelle beach to the north, where you need to go through the mountain in the middle of the island.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256630171_275f42b006_o.jpg">
<p>
Especially if you go through the coastal cliffs, it will be quite secluded, and excursions do not land you here.

In Coral Bay, a large hotel offers a dinner buffet for only 19 ringit ($5). Here you can try fried stingray, I did, but didn’t take it the second time, preferring regular fish. The stingray is edible, but not very tasty - rather rubbery, tougher than squid.

This time I had a GoPro camera with me, so I was able to take photos underwater - and the underwater world is the coolest thing in the Perhentians.

<p>
Much of this was filmed on the beaches just north of Coral Bay, as well as the previously mentioned Romantic and Isabelle. In principle, there are already a lot of interesting things on the outskirts of Coral Bay.

One day I took an excursion to Greater Perhentian (costs about 7 dollars). Since the Big Island is less developed, there are even larger coral reefs and more wildlife along the coast where there are no beaches.

The schools of fish here are gigantic, and the fish are not only not afraid, but even bite, you need to constantly move.
