<h2>Oryol</h2>
<p>
I was in Oryol before in 2005 at the All-Russian Olympiad for schoolchildren in the Russian language. Then we lived in a camp outside the city, and we didn’t walk much around Oryol itself; overall, the memories of the city were positive. In almost ten years the city has improved even more. So, a natural eagle appeared in front of the station ("Oryol" means "eagle").

<p>
This street was not pedestrian then.
<p/>

<p>
I remember well that the most popular place there was McDonald's. And now it's gone. It turned out that the only Mac in Orel is now located in one of the out-of-town shopping centers.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257343914_82e891c990_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Eagle, still an eagle.
<p/>

<p>
In Oryol, quotes from the Bible are written on the asphalt.

<p>
They wanted to paint the poles in the colors of the Russian flag, but they ended up with the flag of San Marino.
<p/>

<p>
I wonder if the freedom inscription has remained like this since 1993?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255869142_2f4fd4cdcb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Busts of famous writers are placed on the façade of the bookstore.
<p/>

<p>
Lenin somehow found his way among them.
<p/>

<p>
Ironic advertising.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257639860_8e601fd52e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Ironic taxi advertisement on a tram.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257343884_8031c25a8a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A good network of establishments with excellent prices in the central regions of Russia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257639835_6309cd60aa_h.jpg"/>
<p>
New buildings.
<p/>

<p>

<p/>

<p>
Old courtyard.
<p/>

<p>
Wall painting.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256596451_4b0801bdb9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The most important feature of Oryol is that they have mastered the art of trimming bushes.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256596406_abde5723ec_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It turned out very cool.
<p/>

<h2>Kursk</h2>
<p>
Welcome to Africa!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257366945_d4f39047f6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Welcome to Asia!
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257073414_612664724c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
They decided to arrange a full "stability" right outside the center of Kursk. The main thing is to make a giant overpass.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257366925_fea8e09573_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And more advertising folding phones.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255596072_945b168a6a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are still some normal places left.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256524588_1a7705617d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Something even old remains.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255596232_1a72fa43ef_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is an interesting painting at the factory.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257366855_116824e462_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>

<p>
On every pole in Kursk hangs a coil of wires, just like in <a href="../romania">Bucharest</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256326796_0e05e93300_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are very elegant lanterns on some of the pillars.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257073654_9bb44f5885_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I went to a residential area, it looks quite normal by Russian standards.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257367100_2eedc7f479_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here stands a triumphal arch in honor of the victory in the Battle of Kursk (1943).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256044372_30574db4d1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And a gigantic alley with tanks.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257367145_2dbe9c5b11_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Near the administration there is a monument to Voldemort, as in <a href="../pskov">Pskov</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257073499_c8d6cf6256_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Another atypical monument - sitting, holding onto a bench.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256772416_d2b8620baf_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the same park there are still some funny sculptures from the old days.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256772486_a9f074be44_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And this is from new times.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256524663_eeb8a90e61_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the Kursk region, competitions among drivers are regularly held.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256973133_d34836128f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Contender for the title of the most original name for a shawarma shop.
<p/>

<p>
In Kursk they made updated signs with bus schedules. In my user opinion, it turned out well. The main result is that using these signs, I was able to get to all the places I needed, which means they fulfill their main purpose. Although the location of information about route operating times and intervals could be done differently.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257815010_cf4b5ce62f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Clowns from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia held a rally in the square under the “All Power to the Soviets” monument. A sad and shameful sight. The circus is very conveniently located on this same square.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257367305_57b142b61b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is what Kursk is like. Far from being the best city in Russia, but not the worst either.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257073309_c434488a7e_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Belgorod</h2>
<p>
When you enter Belgorod, your mouth immediately opens in surprise. What other city in Russia, besides Moscow, St. Petersburg, Vladivostok and Sochi, has such a modern airport? You definitely don’t expect to see this in small Belgorod.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255184662_7b7b924f66_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Further more. The bus station is located next to the airport, on the outskirts of the city. What do we see?
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256115443_752db922a7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is a street in a residential area of a provincial town! Where you can usually witness pain and hopelessness.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255914026_df9c2540a9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I took a bus ride, getting closer to the center. The thought was spinning in my head: “They can, when they really want!”
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256957175_d395ad0a81_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256662689_af10996c09_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I took a walk in the park.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255184777_1fe98c4829_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Everything was so good in Belgorod that I went to inspect the quality of roads and sidewalks in the yards. Some pictures like this appeared before my eyes.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256115648_268ea3c1bf_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255184907_2b5ba8325f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
To be fair, I did find a couple of bad places.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255184742_a48f60d882_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256957485_3af50f4ccd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Although in other cities this would be considered good.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255185017_07de8b62f1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Even in Moscow, not every gateway has such nice tiles.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256663009_5e484e2c3f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The houses are being painted little by little.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256957300_51e89984eb_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p>
In one of the courtyards in the kindergarten there is a monument to Lenin.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256662974_1547449bef_h.jpg"/>
<p>
What is also very characteristic of Belgorod: there are NO MINIBUSES. Even in Moscow and St. Petersburg they exist, although you won’t find them in the tourist center. The buses are not new, but they are still better than a minibus.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255184827_194eec59e3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Chicly designed ventilation hatch.
<p/>

<p>
Unfortunately, old Belgorod was destroyed by the war, and the city center is now an eclectic collection of shopping centers.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255914556_fb7927cd41_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255914586_74df5151fe_h.jpg"/>
<p>
How tidy the residential areas are, and how much advertising there is.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256116018_01dd410d77_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is Russia baby.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256116078_1203350442_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I would build skyscrapers in the center of Belgorod. There is no need to demolish buildings like the administration; in America, there are city administrations from the 20s in downtowns.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255914706_e3c9688436_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Belgorod has a hilly terrain, unusual for Russian cities (as in <a href="../smolensk">Bryansk</a>), the view from the skyscrapers would be excellent.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256958065_e3be1d6827_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And yet in the center there are some gigantic voids, like in the central square.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255914681_ba06b93790_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The whole party is somewhat to the south, near the panorama of the Battle of Kursk (Prokhorovka, the site of the main battle of 1943, is located in the Belgorod region, unfortunately, I had no time to go there).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256116323_cc07643ed3_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256116263_41bd643428_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It can be seen that decent modern buildings are starting to be built in the center of Belgorod. I hope I will live to see the time when all of Russia will look at least like this.
<p/>
