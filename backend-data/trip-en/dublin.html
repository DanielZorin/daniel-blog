<h1>Ireland: Dublin, Kilkenny, Waterford, Cork</h1>
<i>24-26 August 2019</i>
<h2>Dublin</h2>
<p>
Ireland! The last country in Europe, which for many years remained my only blank spot in this part of the world. Since this is such a difficult-to-reach country (due to visas), I, of course, aimed to travel around it as much as possible, and of course I had to start with Dublin - the capital, where almost 40% of the Irish live. I've been to Dublin twice - in August and December.

<p>
The River Liffey divides Dublin city center into two parts. In the southern part there is the castle, cathedrals, and the historical center, while the northern part used to be a poor working-class area, but now it is primarily a place for shopping.

The Dublin Spire is a 120 meter high monument and an object of modern art.
<p/>

<p>
It stands in the middle of the main street of north Dublin with the Post Office and several other organizations and monuments on the boulevard.

<p>
Connolly Railway Station is Dublin's northern station. There is also a second station, Houston, which I have not been to. Both stations are dead-end stations, since there are no transit trains through Dublin - all routes start in the capital, Connolly serves the north, Houston - the south and west.

The design is atypical for old Europe, rather reminiscent of some Latin America.

<p>
We move south. There are a lot of bridges across the river, but this one is considered the symbol of the city - it is called the Halfpenny Bridge because of the cost of crossing in the 19th century.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256817584_4cdcaeba5d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Although moving on other bridges is also not a problem.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257113265_18dc81a6e4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Halfpenny Bridge leads straight to Temple Bar - the main street.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256069656_637244968d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Temple Bar is something between an ordinary European pedestrian street with souvenirs and <a href="../bangkok">Khao San Road</a>.

<p>
It seems there are no rules about the design of facades, although this is the main street. Most likely, this is a feature of Temple Bar - it is always modern, and not frozen in time.

This idea is confirmed by the fact that there is no such thing on the neighboring streets.

In Dublin there is no central square as such, rather a central crossroads where the university and parliament are.

Another shopping street begins from here - after all, if there is a shopping street in the north, then there should be one in the south.

Ireland is a Catholic country, which was the main reason for its conflict with Protestant England. The Irish preserved the Catholic faith after many centuries, when the British tried to eradicate it, giving all sorts of benefits to those who converted to Anglicanism. As a result, it only partially worked out in Northern Ireland, which remains in the Kingdom to this day. All churches in Ireland are a characteristic dark gray color.

Monument to the victims of the Great Famine of 1845-1849. This famine was a real disaster for the Irish people, from which the country has not yet been able to fully recover: Ireland is the only country in the world whose population in 2020 is less than it was in 1840. Even Russia after the revolution, civil war, mass executions and terrible Second World War restored the pre-war population and exceeded it, and Ireland is only now approaching the levels of the early 19th century. In the Irish provinces this is especially noticeable in the large number of abandoned houses and churches.

<p>
All is well in Ireland now. I thought for a long time that this is not the richest country in Europe, because the 2008 crisis hit it hard, and then it was put on a par with Greece and Portugal, but a lot has changed since then. Thanks to the tax regime, all major technology companies like Google and Apple are registered in Ireland, which is why they even stopped focusing on GDP: at some point it grew sharply due to the fact that tech giants began to conduct most of their operations here in order to pay less taxes. Dublin is a fairly expensive city, especially when it comes to housing, especially in the city center, so I had no choice but to live in a residential area and travel to the center by public transport. Even far from the center, accommodation on Airbnb starts from 50 euros, although the quality is high - these are not the cramped rooms of the blocks of central London.

The main transport in Dublin is the bus, there are also a couple of tram and train lines, but they cover a smaller part of the city. The buses here are double-decker and yellow and blue.

The Irish language belongs to the Celtic group. It is rarely used in real life, mainly in villages in the west of the country, but about half of the country's residents speak this language. Irish uses an unusual Celtic script, unlike standard Latin.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257113505_19be688f70_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Irish also has a very unusual spelling, when a lot of vowels are not readable, but serve as separators, much like in Italian in the word ciao the letter i is not readable, but means that c should be read as “ch” and not as “k”. Irish uses as separators some letters that are almost always read in other languages, even in French, for example the letter A - taxi in Irish is written Tacsai.

Let's look at a grocery store in Ireland. This is a SuperValu store near Connolly station in Dublin - not the cheapest store, but not expensive either. This is one of the three largest chains in Ireland (together with Tesco, which is everywhere in England, and the more expensive Dunnes). Popular European discounters Aldi and Lidl also operate here.
Let's start, as usual, with vegetables and fruits. The selection here is standard for Europe, nothing particularly exotic. Oranges are less than 1 euro.
<p/>

From Cork I traveled further by train, experiencing the Irish railways for the first time. The station is a little away from the center.

Train lines map, all names written in Irish. I needed to go to Cill Airne (Killarney) in the lower left corner, for this I needed a transfer at Mala (Mallow in English).

Very often there are picturesque views from the window, since roads and railways are usually not huge multi-lane ones, and therefore are not surrounded by large fences, as in more populated countries.
