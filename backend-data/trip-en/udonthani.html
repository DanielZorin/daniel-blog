<h2>Mukdakhan</h2>
<p>
A city on the border with Laos.

<p>
I suffered for a month without 7-11 in Cambodia and Laos - the first thing I did was go there for Butterfly ice cream before leaving.

<p/>

<p>
It differs from other Thai cities only in the shape of the largest temple - it looks like a quadrangular pyramid.
<p/>

<p>
As far as I can remember, there are no other temples of this shape in Thailand.

Other than that, everything is as usual here. Several large monasteries.

<p>
Interesting sign.
<p/>

<h2>Udon Thani</h2>
<p>
How nice is it to celebrate the New Year in Southeast Asia? It’s better not to be in Laos, where the choice of treats and entertainment is limited, so from southern Laos I moved to northeastern Thailand. Udon Thani is one of the relatively larger cities in Thailand, and it still has an expat community as there is a US military base nearby. Here you can find everything your heart desires.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256415794_7964649d55_c.jpg"/>
<p>
The first thing you need to do is find a place to stay. You can spend the night anywhere, if it's just one night, but for a good rest you need to find a more decent place. In Thailand it can vary a lot, you may find a good hotel, but you could get a bad one too. The location in Udon Thani was simply perfect. Huge room, fast internet, refreshing air conditioning, refrigerator, hot water, freshly renovated, price $10 (350 baht per day) even on New Year's Eve - there's simply nothing to complain about.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256711675_f7eed955e2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It's called Ruysuk Guesthouse.
<p/>

<p>
According to Russian tradition, on December 31st you need to set the table, at least for the two of us. Olivier salad is not sold in Udon; you need to prepare it yourself.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254937232_3038feab17_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Tangerines, Olivier, nori chips, Pringles, cider, Song Sam, cola, pitahaya, passion fruit, strawberries, ice cream, cake.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256416284_00381ca4c0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It's time to see off the old year! The center of life of Udon is the shopping center called Central in the very center of the city.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254937387_55c8ab0621_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There were quite a lot of people there.
<p/>

<p>
52 seconds...
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255666736_b40ee19661_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And 2016 is coming!
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256416504_f094f8ee53_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Everyone is celebrating 2016 somehow, with a phone in hand.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255666906_b258595562_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In my memory, this is the second time I met midnight on December 31 on the street. The last one was in 2012/2013 in <a href="../curitiba">Brazil</a>, then there were fewer people, there was no one outside the square, and I didn’t have a phone, I only had a flask of strong alcohol.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256416614_6d15c6fc04_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In Udon, it wasn’t just "Central" that had a party. American pensioners gathered in a sports bar.
<p/>

There are not many attractions in Udon Thani.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256415994_63aaeba7f4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
From time to time you can see such pompous structures on the streets. I would assume that this is a bus stop, but there are not many buses or minibuses there.
<p/>

It shows the city pillar shrine in the main square.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254938267_6767b6b917_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The main square is a large wasteland.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254938307_96ce105ab9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Traditionally there is a large lake near the center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256416994_f11bda4319_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The temple and paths are like in China.

These alluring inflatable figures are popular in Korea, only here they wave their arms rather than their heads.

<h2>Nong Khai</h2>
<p>
Laotian sculptor Bunleua Sulilat, having fled his homeland after the communists came to power, settled across the river from Vientiane in Nong Khai, Thailand, and continued his business of making Buddha statues. The results of his later work can be seen in Sala Keoku Park.
<p/>

The craftsman's skill has improved over the years, so there is clearly better detail here.

I would call this sculpture “We were waiting for George R.R. Martin’s new book to come out.”
<p/>

In the lake near the temple there lives a whole crowd of fat fish that fight funny if you throw bread at them.

On the way back to the city center I came across a school. The school is a source of food; near them they always sell all sorts of snacks at minimal prices.
<p/>
