<h1>Pakistan: Peshawar, Islamabad, Taxila, Rawalpindi, Gilgit, Skardu</h1>
<i>10-16 August 2023</i>
<h2>Peshawar</h2>
<p>
I started my trip to Pakistan from the city of Peshawar. It is the capital of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region, home to mainly Pashtuns, the same people as neighboring southern Afghanistan. For a long time, this region was famous for lawlessness; part of it was even allocated to a separate territory, the “Tribal Zone,” where there was de facto no central authority. Now all this is in the past, the region is more or less calm.

<p>
On Booking.com there were only three hotels in all of Peshawar (there are dozens in other cities), and I definitely needed to book something for the visa. In the end, I was not accommodated in the hotel I had booked; they said that foreigners were not allowed. I walked to the nearest major street and immediately checked into the best hotel in Peshawar.
<p/>

<p>
The hotel in general was really not bad. Cost a little over $20.
<p/>

<p>
Hotels in Pakistan often offer food delivered to your room.

<p>
This is a very busy street that runs through the entire city, including the historical center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53149920877_1548732548_o.jpg" >
<p>
A BRT line was built on it, completely separated from traffic. So getting to the center was not difficult, I didn’t even have to look for a taxi.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53150994178_bc370fb6ed_o.jpg" >
<p>
There is a rather impressive fortress in the center of Peshawar.

<p>
You can’t go inside, there’s a hotel and a military base there.

<p>
I went for a walk around the city. For an unprepared traveler, such an atmosphere may be shocking, but for me it only reminded me of the glorious days of traveling through India and Bangladesh in 2017.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53150496836_62484399c6_o.jpg" >
<p>
There are no sidewalks here; you need to carefully walk along the edge of the road, avoiding motorcycles and tuk-tuks.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53150496651_8a347ac79a_o.jpg" >
<p>
Periodically there are traces of old architecture, which clearly no one takes special care of.

I went to this food court on recommendation.

<p>
The old city is supposedly surrounded by a wall, and in some places there are still gates left from it.
<p/>

In the central part of the city there is trade everywhere, as in any Pakistani city.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53150993403_a022d8b45d_o.jpg" >
<p>
I went inside. Pakistani mosques often have no doors, meaning the interior is in no way separated from the courtyard.
<p/>

There are often public tanks with free water. Apparently, in Pakistan people don't hesitate about drinking from the same mug.

There are many universities in Peshawar. One of them is even featured on the 1000 rupees note. As in many other Asian countries, in Pakistan you can only enter the university premises with a pass.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53150928865_171dcc3abf_o.jpg" >

I reached the neighboring town of Jamrud. There is a large fortress here, which is still a military base.

Also here is the Khyber Gate - the symbolic entrance to the Khyber Pass leading to Afghanistan. They are depicted on the 10 rupees banknote, making Peshawar the only city to appear on two banknotes at once.

<h2>Islamabad</h2>
<p>
Islamabad is the capital of Pakistan. Islamabad was built from scratch in the 1960s to move the capital there from Karachi. It is similar to other capitals founded at that time - <a href="../brasilia">Brasilia</a> and <a href="../delhi">Chandigarh</a>. Here, too, the city is divided into square sectors, between which wide highways are laid. The distances in Islamabad are huge, so I almost didn’t walk, I went everywhere by taxi.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53150504871_f88f82ac7f_o.jpg" >
<p>
My hotel was named after something that is often crossed.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53151002598_a8230aeb8b_o.jpg" >
<p>
When you drive around Islamabad, this is usually the view from your window. Residential buildings are almost invisible behind the wide roadsides and rows of trees.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53150938490_8de384225a_o.jpg" >
<p>
At first I was surprised why there was such a huge overpass.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53150708114_6969daff8e_o.jpg" >
<p>
And then I realized that it was not for people, but for mopeds.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53150505036_c8d61f7f75_o.jpg" >
<p>
Flags were being sold along the roads, as in a few days it was Independence Day.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53150938565_29b7fedd25_o.jpg" >
<p>
There are almost no tall buildings in Islamabad; this is right in the center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53150708134_ddc47f01da_o.jpg" >
<p>
The first thing I did was go to the lookout in the hills north of the city center.

Then I went to the Pakistan Monument. There is no approach on foot at all, only for cars with a long detour.

Each petal symbolizes a region of Pakistan. The word Pakistan is an acronym for the names of the regions - Punjab, Afghanistan, Kashmir, Sindh. There was nowhere to insert Balochistan, so they took the -stan from it.

It's funny that you can buy local cola here, and the same cola imported from the UAE for double price.

<h2>Taxila</h2>
<p>
Not far from Islamabad, near the city of Taxila, there are the ruins of an ancient city, listed as a World Heritage Site. For a small fee, I chartered a tuk-tuk and toured the main local attractions.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53149935567_c0509bf3c8_o.jpg" >
<p>
The attractions are scattered over a fairly large area; there is no way to get around on foot. Near the city center there is only a museum and small ruins nearby.
<p/>

Taxila was the capital of the Gandhara kingdom (1000-500 BC), then part of Persia, and for some time in the empire of Alexander the Great. After Alexander, the Greco-Indian state of Bactria existed in this region for another 200 years, where the Greek dynasty ruled, and Buddhism and Hellenism were intertwined. The city was abandoned around the 5th century.

<h2>Gilgit</h2>
<p>
A trip to Pakistan would be incomplete without the northernmost region - Gilgit-Baltistan. If you look at the map, you won’t immediately understand where the border is, since it is drawn with a dotted line: the entire north is disputed between India and Pakistan, and China also claims some parts. In 1948, as a result of the war, Pakistan occupied all of Gilgit-Baltistan and a small western part of Kashmir, while India retained most of Kashmir and Ladakh. Later, Pakistan signed a border treaty with China, as a result of which a small strip of the mountains in the north passed to China, but India did not recognize neither this, nor the China’s occupation of Aksai Chin. It takes a long time to get here by bus, but there are two airports: Gilgit and Skardu. Gilgit can only accommodate small planes, which make it especially convenient to look out the window at the surrounding landscapes.

<h2>Gilgit-Skardu Road</h2>
<p>
From Gilgit I took a shared taxi to Skardu, the capital of Baltistan. The road deserves special discussion. The first part of the journey is the Karakoram Highway - one of the most famous roads in the world, connecting Pakistan and China.

<p>
Surprisingly, the signs on the Karakoram Highway are duplicated in Cyrillic, and in the “Chinese” style, as they write with errors on signs in Chinese border cities. And in monospace font.

The road to Skardu goes along the Indus River valley - one of the two main rivers of the Indian region (along with the Ganges). Most of Pakistan stretches along this river, which is much wider in the south.

<h2>Skardu</h2>
<p>
Skardu is the main transport hub of northern Pakistan as it has the main airport capable of handling large aircraft. Treks to high mountain areas begin from Skardu, which, however, need to be specially organized.
<p/>

Unlike Gilgit, the city of Skardu itself has a landmark - a fort on a hill.

From Skardu I flew back to central Pakistan. The flight from Skardu to Islamabad/Lahore is often called one of the most beautiful flights in the world (among regular passenger flights, not special tourist flights like the flight to Everest in Nepal). At check-in, the airline employee was not at all surprised that I asked for a seat by the window on the right side.
