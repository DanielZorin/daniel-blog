<h1>Tanzania: Arusha, Zanzibar, Dar es Salaam</h1>
<i>26-30 July 2024</i>
<h2>Arusha</h2>
<p>
The border between Kenya and Tanzania is very close to Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa. It's only 40-50 kilometers away.
<p/>

<p>
The road from the border. I tried to top up my SIM card (which I already had from my last visit to Tanzania), but they couldn't put the colossal sum of 10,000 shillings ($3) anywhere. In the end, in one of the stalls they gave me a bunch of scratch cards worth 1,000 and 2,000 shillings, and I added them one by one.
<p/>

<p>
Then I got on this minibus to the nearest city of Moshi. It was about 20 kilometers away, and it took about an hour and a half - we stopped at every pole, and someone got on with full buckets of goods. The minibus was very cramped.
<p/>

<p>
I expected that Kilimanjaro would be clearly visible from Moshi, but somehow it is not. The mountain is right ahead.
<p/>

<p>
It is only 20 kilometers away, but only a barely distinguishable silhouette is visible. In these photos you can still make it out somehow.

Bus station. As you can see, there are many large decent buses in Tanzania. I got on one of them and went to Arusha (the main city of the region).
<p/>

<h2>Zanzibar</h2>
<p>
Zanzibar is an island off the coast of East Africa with an unusual history. Due to its strategic location, Zanzibar was colonized before most of Africa, and remained the main Arab outpost in the region. Yes, it wasn't only the Europeans who were involved in colonialism. Zanzibar was ruled from Oman, then became a British protectorate. In 1963 it became independent, and a year later there was a revolution, and all the Arabs were expelled or killed, and Zanzibar united with neighboring Tanganyika to form the new state of Tanzania (short for Tanganyika + Zanzibar). Now it is one of the most visited tourist destinations in Africa. 
<p/>

<p>
The main city is officially called Zanzibar City, but everyone calls it Stone Town, after the name of the central historic district (a World Heritage site).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946278903_8721a4569d_h.jpg" >

Stone Town is a labyrinth of narrow pedestrian streets.

There are two main places for a beach holiday in Zanzibar: the northern edge and the coast in the southeast. In the very north is the village of Nungwi, probably the most touristy place on the island.

I have not seen many places with such photogenic blue water and white sand. Well, in some places in the Caribbean, and in Southeast Asia. Zanzibar is quite easy to get to.

I went to Nungwi on a bus like this. Recently, most minibuses in Zanzibar have been replaced by buses, so traveling is now more or less comfortable.

Dar es Salaam is not the capital of Tanzania (that's the city of Dodoma in the center of the country), but the largest city. It turned out to be quite an interesting and in some places nice city.

The next day I was flying out, so I stayed in an inexpensive hotel right opposite the airport, fortunately the airport is in a residential area. There is a direct road from the airport to the city center. I decided to try to get there by bus for the experience. Buses arrived at the stop every 20 seconds, with a sign on the side indicating where they were going. Many seemed to be going to the central areas, but absolutely all of them were packed to the brim.
