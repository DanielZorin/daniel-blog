<h1>Sweden: Gothenburg, Helsingborg, Malmo, Lund</h1>
<i>22-24 April 2012</i>
<h2>Gothenburg</h2>
<p>
I arrived in Gothenburg at a bad time - 3 o'clock in the morning on Sunday. At the station, people mostly slept on benches, but one couple talked loudly, keeping me awake. That night I hated the Swedish language. It warmed my soul that, suffering from insomnia, I booked a double room for the same day for only $25, the price of a bed in a hostel, I just had to wait for check-in time. Around 9 am it dawned and I went for a walk around the city. The city was a rather pleasant Silent Hill.

It seems easy to navigate the center.

<p>
But without a map (and the tour office opened at 12) I began to move somewhere in the wrong direction.

Then I noticed a fortress on the mountain, which I had read about before, and safely got to it.

It was already possible to find my way there.

An amazing thing - a machine that gives out a free detailed map of the city, not only of the tourist center, but of all the outskirts too. And it works properly!

Bridges over all kinds of streams have names and coats of arms.

In search of multiculturalism, I wandered into a vegetable market. It was really full of Arabs, but it was still very clean.

There are shops with signs in Arabic, exchange offices where you can exchange currencies of different Arab countries.

Culturally enriched, I went to Lund.
<p/>
<h2>Lund</h2>
<p>
Lund greeted me with a giant bicycle parking lot.

If you look closely, many bicycles are not even tied down in any way. The owners rely either on honesty or on the theory of probability.

In general, Lund is a city of students. There was not enough time, so I did not go inside, but looked around the university campus from the outside.

Another attraction of Lund is the hostel, located in an old train carriage, driven onto sidings.
