<h1>Czech Republic: Prague, Karlovy Vary</h1>
<i>16-23 August 2009</i>
<h2>Prague</h2>
<p>
In August 2009 I visited the Czech Republic. It was a tour, but as light as possible - essentially just a charter flight (to the small airport of Pardubice, and not the main one in Prague), transfer and hotel. The hotel was cheap and not in the center, you had to go by metro, which was a cool experience for me. There were no excursions included; we went to Karlovy Vary and Dresden ourselves. Now, looking at the photo, I understand that there were quite few tourists in Prague then. At the peak of summer 2009 there are far fewer people on the main square than in winter 2018.

Karlovy Vary is a city of luxury hotels and galleries with drinking fountains.
