<h1>United Kingdom: London, Oxford, Cambridge</h1>
<i>2-5 October, 7, 9-10 December 2019</i>
<h2>London</h2>
<p>
London. It is the largest city in Europe (not counting Moscow and Istanbul), and undoubtedly one of the most significant. I've already been to London twice - in 2001 and <a href="../london">in 2014</a>, when I walked around quite well in two days. This time I was in London for about a week in total, but in pieces - it’s convenient to fly in and out of London, because there are five airports and flights for every taste.

The symbol of London, Big Ben, was under repair all this time and looked like this.

It was possible to look at the parliament only from the reverse side.

For the first time I visited the Tower. It's pretty pricey at almost £30.
<p/>

<p>
In the center of the fortress there is a square White Tower.
<p/>

<p>
Tours of the Tower are led by local guards ("beefeaters") in distinctive uniform.

<p>
They live in the Tower itself, so there are parts of it that are closed to visitors where the apartments are located.
<p/>

<p>
There are also residential buildings in the lower level of the walls.

It's dark inside and you can't take pictures. The royal jewels and regalia are displayed there and one can see the largest diamond in the world (Cullinan I) in the scepter and the most famous (Kohinoor) in the crown.

In the evening this place is very deserted, only rare tourists wander around the square - there are no residential buildings or restaurants around - only the palace and parks.

I lived in two different places in London through Airbnb. The first one was far out on the outskirts, at the end of the red underground line in the Ilford area.

Interesting fact: London's official population is only 9,400 people because the City of London administrative division only includes the original historic area of ​​London in the Tower area, where the City of London offices are now mainly located. Westminster is formally a separate city, and all other areas are called boroughs. The area between the Tower and Westminster, despite its central location, was less familiar to me, so I spent some time exploring it.

One day I decided to find the bench in a public park "on the corner of Beckton and Barking" that Oxxxymiron described in "The Gremlin's Song". It is a well-known fact that there is no park on the corner of Beckton Road and Barking Road in the immigrant district of Kenning Town (you can look at Google panoramas). The party bench was located in Green Park (in the very center, near Buckingham Palace). From the photo I found a place with visually the same angle, but there was no bench there; it seems the benches have been rearranged a little over the years. But the appearance has not changed.

London is one of the busiest cities in Europe. London has many train stations serving different destinations, just like Paris and Moscow (cities that were already huge in the mid-19th century when train stations were built). In addition, the first metro in history was opened here.
Definitely the most beautiful station in London (and one of the top ones in the whole world) is St. Pancras Station.
<p/>

<p>
Although this station is located in the northern part of the center, trains leave from here to the south - to France through the Channel Tunnel.

The largest station in London and in all of England is Waterloo. It is so large that you cannot see the façade from the street, but you can see it from the inside. Though in terms of passenger traffic, this station is half that of the European leaders - Paris and Hamburg, but at <a href="../tokyo">Shinjuku Station</a> there are approximately 10 times more people passing through.

Let's look at London from above. There are several observation platforms in the city center, the most famous being the London Eye Ferris wheel (near Parliament) and The Shard skyscraper. But there is another one where entry is absolutely free, you just need to book a free ticket for a certain time (about a month in advance) - London Sky Garden, located in one of the high-rise buildings in the City.
<p/>

The downside of this site is that the view is not in all directions. The view to the north is very poor - the balcony is in the way, and for some reason you can’t go onto it.

There is a good chance of seeing London when taking off and landing at the airport. This, of course, depends on the airport and where you are flying to. For example, from Moscow to Luton you are unlikely to see anything, since Luton is far north of London. The closest airports to the center are Heathrow and City. When I flew into Heathrow, the landing was almost above the city center, although it remained exactly below.

Very close to London are two neighboring cities - Windsor and Eton. One is home to the royal family, and the other is home to a famous college.

<h2>Oxford</h2>
<p>
Oxford is the city where perhaps the world's most famous university is located. It is one of the most popular tourist destinations in England.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256607291_408b8c2e08_o.jpg">
<p>
The structure of the university is complex. Oxford has 38 colleges. Each college has its own beautiful building (or rather, a whole block of neighboring buildings), but they do not specialize in any particular subject. There are centralized faculties that accept students, say, in the field of "mathematics", and the students are somehow distributed evenly across colleges. Teachers can also be from different colleges, that is, the function of a college in the modern world is a place where students live and communicate.
</p>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255879247_b6e732deb5_o.jpg">
<p>
To confuse everyone, one of the colleges is called University College. Half of the colleges are named after various saints.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257650285_3a033ab371_o.jpg">
<p>
There are a lot of tourists in Oxford, quite noticeably a lot, so it is not surprising that all the colleges are closed to the public most of the time, otherwise it would be chaos.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255879332_50d3941aed_o.jpg">
<p>
Some colleges that are in the very center and have the greatest historical value, are open for a couple of hours one or two days a week, mainly you can see their chapels and assembly halls. You don’t just go to the audience.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257354979_bb67982917_o.jpg">

<h2>Cambridge</h2>
<p>
The second university city in England is Cambridge, which is slightly further from London than Oxford and in a different direction. I have already been to the city of Cambridge <a href="../boston">in America</a>, where the two most famous universities of the USA are located.
<p/>

<p>
There are noticeably fewer tourists in Cambridge than in Oxford, and the colleges are not so closed - in some you can go into the courtyard and walk around the grounds.
<p/>

This is Christ's College. Almost all Cambridge colleges have “sisters” in Oxford; students from such friendly colleges can visit each other’s buildings.
