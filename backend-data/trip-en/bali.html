<h2>Bali</h2>
<p>
I have been to many places and never had any particular conflicts with the local population. Every country has some small percentage of bad people. But out of all more than 100 countries and more than 1000 cities, only the inhabitants of the island of Bali have sunk into my soul so much that the mention of this island causes an involuntary gag reflex in me before I have time to remember what is good there. Bali is the island with the highest concentration of assholes in the world. Somewhere they can cheat you out of money in such a way that you won’t even understand right away, but the Balinese’s national sport is to make you feel as disgusted as possible.

Here you are walking down the street in Cambodia or, say, in India, famous for intrusive service, tuk-tukers and salesmen drive up to you with offers. What will a Hindu do if you ignore him or say calmly “no”? He will go his own way to look for clients further. What will the Balinese do? He will shout after you, “Fuck you!” If he did something nasty to someone else, the Balinese’s day was not in vain.
<p/>

Bali is the only place in Asia (and even more so in Indonesia) where, entering some corner, you can hear a rude “What are you doing here?”
<p/>

<p>
What was the maximum amount they tried to trick you into? Doubled the price? Three times? In Bali they tried to scam me SIX times, and in an official store with a cash register - they seemed to cheat me at the wrong price. This is how they can cheat in a supermarket when you have a whole cart of groceries and a receipt a meter long, but in Bali there are no limits to impudence, so here they try to cheat even with the only item on the receipt.
Only in Bali did I see scales that were doubled. Yes, you heard right. If you put two kilograms on them, they will show four.
<p/>

<p>
In Bali, there are scam exchange offices at every turn. They are easily identified by the rate higher than the official one, usually with nines at the end. How it works. Let's say you change $100. This is about 1,300,000 rupees, 13 bills of 100 thousand rupees plus a few small bills. Instead, you are given the amount in twenties, laid out in thick stacks. Before giving you the full amount, the money changer will carefully drop some of the bills under the counter, hoping that you will not count. I counted it and found out he threw almost half of it under the counter. In response to the remark, the rate immediately magically changed.
It’s easy to avoid this - there are quite a lot of normal exchangers that look like a mini bank branch. But do you know what's worst? These fraudulent exchangers are really everywhere. There are dozens, if not hundreds of them. And in each there must be a swindler trained to cheat. It seems that somewhere in Bali there is a university of scammers named after Ostap Bender?

What would happen in a normal country if you parked your car in the wrong place, blocking the exit from somewhere? You will be given a fine and your car will be sent to the impound lot. What will happen in Bali? Your tires will be slashed. It doesn’t matter that the car will still block the exit, and it will be even more difficult to remove it, the main thing is to act as meanly as possible, otherwise the day will be in vain.

Do you want me to show you the most entitled journalist in the world? Read the article.
In short, the Balinese complain that tourists from China don't spend much money on their beautiful island. The wording itself is striking in its impudence: it would seem that it still doesn’t hurt that someone travels on a budget and spends little money; earning 10 dollars is clearly better than earning zero. But here are the calculations: the Chinese spend from 100 to 200 dollars a day, and Europeans and Australians - from 600 to 800. What were they smoking there? I can’t even imagine how you can spend $800 a day, other than renting a personal plane. Bali is actually an inexpensive island. Here in a FIVE-STAR hotel you can rent a room for 70 dollars, well, in the most expensive one for 200. Probably, the presidential suite will cost 800, but a maximum of 1000 tourists out of several million live like this. And the majority of Australians are not exactly millionaires - for Australia this is the closest cheap resort. They live in three-star hotels for 30-40 dollars (or in guesthouses for 10-20) and drink beer for 2.

How touching - it costs less than $1 to recharge a phone, and almost two dollars to recharge a camera (despite the fact that it is not clear where the battery capacity is higher). In Moscow, an entire apartment consumes about 5 dollars worth of electricity per month. I guess in Bali electricity is produced by pedal traction.

<p>
Why plow the rice fields when you can charge $4 for a photo? I haven’t visited many tourist attractions in Bali; many of them simply won’t let you in without a guide, which, of course, costs 20-30 dollars. Fortunately, Indonesia is full of volcanoes on other islands.

A rule of thumb is that the more tourist information offices there are in a city, the less useful they are.

Check it out - Bali tourist map, you can get it at the airport. Everything is like in Europe, right?
<p/>

<p>
Taxi drivers in all countries are assholes. To the credit of the Balinese, I can say that one of the two agrees to go according to the meter; it could have been worse. Butthurt of the Balinese from the Uber service, however, is of enchanting proportions. Uber drivers have to hide themselves, because taxi drivers attack and hit their cars. Well, what if you can get insulted just by passing by, what can we say about those who take away income?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256075423_5c706b30d8_o.jpg">
<p>
You can drive around Kuta using a meter, but transporting over longer distances is the signature business of the Balinese. Every second person standing on the street does not sell anything, but offers a taxi to other cities.

About 10 years ago, Bali had public transport, like other Indonesian islands, namely “bemo” minibuses. Now they are gone. More precisely, bemos themselves can still be found, but they are essentially taxis, only cheaper than cars with air conditioning. Here, for example, is the main bus station in Denpasar.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255145737_c0f318f26c_o.jpg">
<p>
Several minibuses are parked, but not a single passenger is visible. Bali became rich and now everyone has at least a motorcycle. The result is deplorable - driving in Bali is extremely slow, because most of the roads are narrow two-lane, and there are traffic jams everywhere, even between cities. It just seems that by renting a car you can travel around half the island in a day; in reality half the day will be spent stuck in traffic jams.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256917960_fc8a2b22c7_o.jpg">
<p>
In Bali there is such a branded local “public transport” - like buses between cities, even with a schedule, but at a price only 20 percent lower than a taxi. Accordingly, if you are not alone, it is cheaper to take a taxi than to take such a “bus”. There is a local analogue in Kuta. Check out the schedule. For example, within Kuta, travel costs 20,000. For this money, you can travel 3 kilometers by taxi according to the meter, this is almost the size of Kuta in length.
<p/>

Check out the quality of drainage: we have learned how to make tiles, but not yet how to make manholes. After the rain, you can transfer to boats.

There is also a real bus in Bali, recently organized! It seems that someone from distant Jakarta is trying to change something in this serpentarium.

This is what dreams look like, clearly made under LSD. Check out ultra-convenient routes that intersect with each other at one point, so that you need to make as many transfers as possible.
<p/>

<p>
Here's the real network. I've traveled on the green line twice, it works, even has dedicated stops. I have doubts about the red line - I didn’t notice any buses there, maybe they run so rarely?
<p/>

Bali is called paradise in advertising. Ha ha ha. Sartre said that hell is other people. In this case, it's true: Bali is an example of how, in a normal place, people create real hell for each other.

How to live correctly in Bali: impenetrable calm, cynicism as high as the Burj Khalifa and visiting trusted places. Then you can enjoy your stay on the island, and I’ll tell you exactly how next time.

Usually everyone criticizes Kuta and praises the rest of Bali. I will praise Kuta, and here’s why. Compared to other regions of Indonesia, the nature of Bali is not particularly impressive, but there is no better place to relax in civilized conditions within Indonesia. If in the rest of Indonesia you will spend a long time looking for a hotel with air conditioning, and it is very likely that instead of a shower there will be a faucet and a bucket, then in Kuta you can rent an excellent hotel for 10 dollars (sometimes even with three stars). Also in Kuta there are many restaurants with a variety of food from McDonald's to marbled beef steaks, which will be very useful after eating monotonous Indonesian food for a long time. In general, Kuta is a place where you should go to take a break from a long trip.
<p/>

<p>
This is what a room for 10 dollars in Kuta looks like. It’s in the southern part of the city; I walked to the airport in about 15 minutes.
<p/>

<p>
Of course, you need to specifically look for such places; if you go at random, the price will be closer to $20. Oddly enough, booking.com is useful in Kuta. A bed in a hostel, by the way, can also cost $10.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255135037_f2188fa3f3_o.jpg">
<p>
But you can check into such a hotel for 40 dollars a day. It has four stars.

We once hung out there near the pool on the roof, taking pizza for 6 dollars.

Now about the food. I’ll point out a few top places, they should all be easy to Google. This is Warung Souvlaki, they serve Greek cuisine.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255875241_dd11d5d6a9_o.jpg">
<p>
The prices are very affordable - the two of us spent around $10. Well, more expensive than eating noodles at a roadside stand, yes. Greek salad costs $3.
<p/>

Warung Totemo. It's funny that this restaurant is also called a warung, like the poor eateries with fried rice for 10 thousand rupees.

About 'going'. Walking in Kuta is very inconvenient. Even if two points are nearby, walking from one to the other can take a very long time, because the street grid is built very inconveniently - many streets end in dead ends instead of leading to the next big street, there are few through passages from the beach through parallel streets. Many streets have no sidewalks.

Kuta beach. Swimming in southern Bali is not possible. It seems like there are several beaches on the far northern coast where you can swim, but in the south there are waves everywhere, so people come here to surf.

There are quite a lot of people at the peak time. Pay attention to the water - everyone is surfing there. Kuta Beach is a place for noobs; those more experienced in surfing live to the north in the Seminyak area or go to various southern beaches. Kuta is full of instructors who teach beginners.

In Bali, everywhere in the morning a plate with food and flowers is placed near the entrance to the house to “feed the spirits.” It’s touching that they also put a cigarette in there, it’s very Indonesian.

They say that low class people go to Kuta, but hipsters and enlightened people go to Ubud, that’s where the culture is. I feel more like a hipster because I like Kuta. Ubud is not an outstanding place, and certainly not where you need to go to avoid being among the crowds of tourists, because there are twice as many tourists here as in Kuta.
<p/>

The cool climate thing is also nonsense. Ubud is located at a fantastic altitude of 200 meters above sea level, and it is just as deadly hot here as on the coast. All the streets are filled with souvenir shops.

Later, I watched the film “Eat, Pray, Love,” that greatly promoted Bali and Ubud in particular. Wrong movie, I would have done everything different. I'm indifferent to Italian food. You definitely shouldn’t go to India to pray - a country with a primitive and backward culture, where religious differences are still resolved with massacres. Well, Bali, for the reasons I previously stated, is one of the least romantic places on Earth.

<h2>Komodo National Park</h2>

The road to Komodo National Park, where dragons (aka monitor lizards) live, goes through the city of Labuanbajo on Flores Island.

Dragons live only on two large islands: Komodo and Rinca, and on the small ones adjacent to them. All these islands are nature reserves; you cannot spend the night there. It’s a long way to get to Komodo; people usually go there on a minimum two-day tour with an overnight stay on the ship. It takes about three hours to sail to Rinca, you can go there in one day. A standard tour costs 300 thousand rupees (about $25), plus about 250 more for entrance to the national park and ranger services per group, which are collected on the spot.

There is one place on Rinca where these lizards constantly hang out in large numbers - near the kitchen. On Komodo, there is a chance you won’t encounter them at all, unless you’re very lucky.

The snorkeling in the park is excellent, there are a lot of fish, corals, starfish and other creatures. It should be great to have a seaside holiday in these areas, although most likely it’s not as budget-friendly as in the Perhentians.

<h2>Sumbawa</h2>
<p>
The island of Sumbawa is a kind of terra incognita for tourists between the fairly visited Flores and Lombok. It is either passed by bus without stopping, or sailed around on tourist boats. In principle, if you need to get to Lombok from Flores, this can be done in a day: in the morning you take the ferry to Labuanbajo, in the evening you get to the city of Bima on Sumbawa, from where night buses go directly to Mataram. The next evening, if you wish, you can be in Bali. I didn’t know about such innovations, and out of curiosity I initially planned to cross Sumbawa during the day. It was tough, but not without interest.
For starters, the Flores-Sumbawa ferry runs once a day, with a seven-hour journey. At that time it was my longest journey on a ship. Fortunately, the ferry is huge, and there is no swaying in it.

Don’t be confused by the distance of 250 kilometers; by Indonesian standards, such a distance takes at least 10 hours to travel. You definitely need to eat several times in cafes with double prices, stand in some kind of traffic jam, collect passengers, and just drive for your own pleasure at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour.

Sumbawa is a very poor island, statistically the poorest island I've been to in Indonesia. There is still only one mobile operator, a normal road has only recently been built, there are almost no shopping centers, civilized transport is just appearing. There is poverty in the villages. Compare with Sulawesi.
<p/>

<p>
On Sumbawa, I saw for the first time how in very poor villages locals stand in the middle of the road with a net and collect 1-2 thousand rupees from all passing cars. In Russia, if someone tried to do this, he would immediately get hit in the face by the drivers, and after 15 minutes he would be packed up by riot police and go to prison, but in Indonesia, no problem.

Here we stood for a long time. It looks like a section of the road is being repaired and traffic is only being allowed in one direction at a time. Judging by the amount of garbage and the fact that there are ice cream carts nearby, although there are no villages for 10 kilometers around, it is not the first day of repairs.

Overnight in Sumbawa Besar. That's fucked up. There are only two hotels near the bus station (on the outskirts of the city). I looked for the first one for a long time, it turned out that for 20 dollars they offer a dirty room without air conditioning and a shower, and there are no opportunities to bargain. I went to the second one, for $12 it had air conditioning, also not very good, but still not so blatant. At the crossroads there is a statue of two warriors with sticks.

<h2>Lombok</h2>
<p>
Lombok is a neighboring island to Bali. Some people say that it’s like Bali, only without tourists, but I would say that it’s just a poor and backward island by Indonesian standards, where you can go only to climb the Rinjani volcano (which is not an easy task and takes more than one day) .
<p/>

The ferry from Sumbawa arrives at Labuan Lombok on the east coast. We had to hitchhike to Mataram in the west - public transport in Lombok is on its last legs, like in Bali.

Budget ferries run from Lombok to Bali for about 40 thousand rupees. A transfer by fast boat costs 10 times more, but you don’t have to go from the port to Mataram, and from there to the ferry to Gili.

<h2>Gili Air</h2>
<p>
There are three small tourist islands off the northern coast of Lombok: Gili Trawangan, Gili Meno and Gili Air. The first is famous for its night discos, the second for its expensive hotels, and the third for its good beaches, so I chose Gili Air for a day trip. To get there, you need to find the elusive minibus from Mataram to the ferry and bargain for a long time. There is a lot of graffiti near the ferry terminal.

I read about numerous scams in this place, but I didn’t find anything like that. You just go to the office and buy a ticket. There were no minibuses back, but we managed to negotiate with the taxi driver who was taking other tourists to the airport to give us a lift to Mataram for a normal price.

Can I recommend going to Gili? Don't know. There is a good beach here, but for me there is not enough civilization, and the nature is not particularly impressive to compensate for this. The proximity to Bali is imaginary - either travel all day in one direction, or pay for a speed boat the amount for which you can buy a plane ticket to some more interesting place.
