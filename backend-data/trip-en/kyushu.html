<h1>Japan: Shimonoseki, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, Kumamoto, Kagoshima</h1>
<i>14-16 December 2017</i>
<h2>Shimonoseki</h2>
<p>
The last city I visited on the island of Honshu was Shimonoseki, located exactly on the Kammon Strait separating Honshu from Kyushu. Shimonoseki is best known for its puffer fish (fugu), which has become the local mascot.

<p>
Fugu is a very poisonous fish that can only be eaten after special long-term processing, so it has a certain reputation of a dish for risk-takers. Chefs preparing fugu must obtain a special license. In the store at the station you can buy all sorts of fugu products, including the dried fugu I tried.

<h2>Kitakyushu</h2>
<p>
Across the strait begins the city of Kitakyushu. Kitakyushu appeared on the map relatively recently as a result of the unification of five neighboring cities, the name literally means “North of Kyushu Island”. I visited two of the five - the port of Mojiko and the largest former city of Kokura, which can now be considered the center of Kitakyushu.
<p/>

<p>
From the shore of Mojiko you can clearly see the same Kammon Strait and the island of Honshu on the other side.

The area retains many buildings from the late 19th century, a rarity in Japan. At that time it was a major international port. Here is the customs building.

Car plate numbers. At the top, first the name of the city in hieroglyphs (instead of a code), then the series. Passenger cars have the 5XX or 3XX series (with an engine larger than 2000 cubic meters). The number consists of a hiragana character and four digits. The series have been three-digit since 1998, when numbers with two-digit series ended.

Let's look at a supermarket in Japan. In this country, chains are not as widespread as in Europe and Russia. Although there are nationwide chains like MaxValu, even they only have a couple of stores, even in large cities. Almost all the stores I visited were non-chain stores, but the assortment is similar, and there is ready made food in medium and large stores. This is a MaxValu store in Fukuoka, near Hakata Station.
Prices are in yen ($1 = 110 yen), the larger number is the base price, the smaller number at the bottom is the actual price plus 8% sales tax (was raised to 10% at the end of 2019, but not on food). Unlike America, here, firstly, the tax is the same for all goods, and secondly, you don’t need to add in your mind, the price with tax is always indicated, even if it’s small.

Well, the main thing I usually came to stores for was ready-made food. There is a lot of it, it's affordable, it's almost like in a restaurant. In the evening, a 30-50% discount makes the food almost free. So, sushi boxes of 10 cost 500-700 yen, i.e. 50-70 yen per piece (20-30 rubles). With a double discount, it turns out to be 10-15 rubles, this is the price at the night market in Thailand (5 baht).

<h2>Kagoshima</h2>
<p>
And the final point of my journey is Kagoshima, the southernmost large city on the Japanese islands. Residents of Kagoshima literally live on a volcano - it is visible from everywhere, and eruptions occur with enviable regularity. For this reason, Kagoshima is sometimes compared to the Italian city of <a href="http://goo.gl/2ueXyx">Naples</a>.

<p>
Sakurajima erupts about once every two days, and I arrived on a day when there was no eruption, and the peak was also in fog. Well, luck doesn’t always accompany you, but I managed to see Fuji.

The seashore here has the expected black sand.

<p>
Due to frequent eruptions, Kagoshima has a unique feature - bags and special places for collecting ash, which dusts the city during an eruption.

Sakurajima used to be an island in a large bay off the coast of Kagoshima, but after a large eruption in the 19th century, solidified lava connected the island to the shore of the bay opposite the city. So you can get there by car, but it's much faster by ferry from the city center.

There are buses on the peninsula (mainly for tourists), but they rarely run in winter. There is no way to climb to the top, only to the observation point on the slopes. So I walked around the area on foot.
<p/>

There is a forest of these thorny bushes that are unfamiliar to me, like low fir trees.

Apparently they grow well on volcanic ash.

You can walk a little along the shore among the lava debris.

Sakurajima has hot springs, which is not surprising. You can warm your feet.

We return to Kagoshima itself. This is clearly a southern city - in mid-December there is dense greenery.

The Shuseikan Factory was one of the first industrial plants built during the modernization of Japan in 1865. A group of such factories across the country were included in the UNESCO Heritage List as examples of industrial architecture. Gionnosu battery is also there.
