<h1>Russia: Ulyanovsk, Samara</h1>
<i>16-17 December 2014</i>
<h2>Ulyanovsk</h2>
<p>
Ulyanovsk is the city where Lenin was born. I have already shown the houses where <a href="../tbilisi">Stalin</a> and <a href="../austria">Hitler</a> were born, and here is the house where Lenin was born. The Ulyanov family rented an apartment in this house for several months, then they moved to the house opposite, and later lived in some other houses. The most interesting thing is that different people lived in this house almost until the end of the 1960s, and only then, on the centenary of Lenin’s birth (1970), they made a museum.
<p/>

<p>
Almost the entire street was demolished, leaving only a few houses over which a memorial was built on a Brezhnev scale.
<p/>

<p>
At the memorial, you can fully satisfy your craving for photographing monuments to Lenin.

And such a monument, only a large one, stands in <a href="../vyborg">Razliv</a>.

Pay attention to the portrait of Putin and Crimea on the far wall.

The exhibition ends with a mega-epic hall, where there is also a monument to Lenin.

It's fun outside too. There is a monument to Lenin and his mother.

Well, the main monument. How about this proposal: allocate a place in Ulyanovsk where thousands of monuments to Lenin from all over the country can be brought? It would be a hit among foreigners.

The emblem of Ulyanovsk is the letter U.

There is also a monument to the letter Ё, because its inventor, Karamzin, was from these parts.

The writer Goncharov also lived in Ulyanovsk.

Ulyanovsk was awarded the Order of Lenin, who would doubt it.

Very often the city is called by a double name (it was originally Simbirsk).

But the most surprising thing is that for some reason traffic lights came to Ulyanovsk straight from <a href="../belarus">Minsk</a>.

<h2>Samara</h2>
<p>
The legendary Zhigulevskoye beer is produced in Samara. It is difficult to find real "Zhigulevskoye" in Moscow. The label must show a brewery with four pipes.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255633843_6260643440_o.jpg">
<p>
Beer here is sold at a price of 58 rubles per liter, poured into your bottle. In a store nearby you can buy it in bottles with labels a bit more expensive (120 rubles for a two-liter bottle).
<p/>

<p>
In the summer, Samara residents buy beer and drink it on the banks of the Volga, to which you can just go down. In winter, no one drank outside.
<p/>

In terms of architecture, Samara was a pleasant surprise; it has a vast old city.

During Soviet times, Samara was not a tourist center because the defense industry was concentrated there. Foreigners were generally prohibited from entering the city. And who would want to go to a city called “Kuibyshev”? Samara is a different matter.
<p/>

Samara stands at the confluence of the Volga and Samara rivers. Closer to the confluence, the old city has already been almost completely demolished and rebuilt.

In 1941-1942, they planned to evacuate the Soviet government to Samara, although Stalin remained in Moscow. For several years there were foreign embassies in Samara. A bunker 30 meters deep was built for Stalin, which in fact is not as big as it seems.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255633988_e5539fc6c4_o.jpg">
<p>
All the rooms in the bunker are very cramped, except for one - the meeting room.
<p/>

You can look at Stalin's personal toilet.
<p/>

<p>
And an ordinary toilet. You can enter the bunker only with a guided tour, excursions every hour (at 10-00, 11-00, etc.), there are many groups, so if you come at the beginning of the hour, seeing the bunker is not a problem. The ticket costs 80 rubles.

There is a metro in Samara. Out of curiosity, I took it. What is the point of the metro is not very clear, because it goes from nowhere to nowhere, or rather from the area where the factories are located to an ordinary area a few kilometers from the center. You cannot get to the train station or bus station by metro. The metro did not reach the city center; a new station will open in the near future, which is closer to the center, and the next one will be in the center. If someone needs to get from a residential area to the center, it is easier to take a direct bus rather than the metro, and then take a bus/tram, so as not to pay double fares. There are transport cards in Samara, but as far as I understand, transfers are not free.

Well, while there is no metro in the center, there are huge traffic jams in Samara, almost like in Moscow and <a href="../vladivostok">Vladivostok</a>.
