<h1>Russia: Kozelsk</h1>
<i>29-30 March 2017</i>
<h2>Kozelsk</h2>
<p>
Kozelsk is a small town in the Kaluga region. To get there from Moscow, you first need to travel three hours to Kaluga by train, then about an hour by bus. The quality of the road is excellent, the bus goes quite quickly.

<p>
From the history course, I knew that Kozelsk withstood the siege of the Mongols for a long time during the invasion, for that it was completely destroyed. There are many objects in the city related to the theme of heroes; even bus stops are themed.

There are two large streets in Kozelsk; at their intersection there is the center with various shops.

<p>
For such a small city (less than 20,000), retail is very developed here: there is Pyaterochka, Diksi, Eldorado, Fix Price, and many others.

By the way, on the minibus it says “Obama is a schmuck.” Such inscriptions really exist!

Anyone remember the "Vonnie" meme? <i>Pictures of sad Winnie the Pooh under drugs, with drug-related jokes.</i> It seems that all the sculptures here are inspired by it.

Deshovki is a village adjacent to Kozelsk. From the city center it's about 3-4 kilometers. The shops here are simpler and the selection is much more modest.
