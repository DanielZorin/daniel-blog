<h1>Ukraine: Skadovsk</h1>
<i>August 2003</i>
<p>
In 2003, I went alone to a summer camp for schoolchildren. It was in Ukraine, but not in Crimea, but in the Kherson region (and we traveled by train to Mykolaiv in the neighboring Mykolaiv region). From there there were excursions to Kherson and the Askania Nova reserve. The conditions in the camp were very spartan, the food was, of course, very bad, there was a stupid 'quiet hour' during the day, and swimming in the sea was only about five minutes a day, but it was fun. That's when I learned to play preference card game.
