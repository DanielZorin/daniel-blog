<h2>Bucharest</h2>
<p>
Once upon a time there was a dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu. Somehow it happened that his name became almost a common noun to denote an extravagant tyrant. Perhaps the reason is the stark contrast between the scale of the personality cult of the man who ruled Romania for decades and how quickly and sadly his story ended. Just yesterday he could gather tens of thousands of slaves for a rally, today he is running from the roof of his palace in a helicopter, and tomorrow they will put him up against a wall and shoot him. A typical end for a typical dictator. One of the important results of Ceausescu's rule (as well as communist dictators in other countries) was the destruction of the country's cultural heritage. Ceausescu demolished half of Bucharest to build palaces for himself and his party cronies.

<p>
The most famous example is, of course, the Parliament, one of the largest buildings in the world. Why did communist Romania even have a parliament? All the same, deputies were elected on "elections" with one candidate and did not decide anything.
<p/>

As usual, huge wide avenues were laid out.
<p/>

There are kilometers from one building to another.

This is the building from the balcony of which Ceausescu last tried to speak to the crowd. Later he fled from there by helicopter.

If you drive a few stops along the avenue leading from the parliament, you can get to a very interesting place, where another monumental building was supposed to be built, but it didn’t happen.

Bucharest is sometimes called little <a href="../paris">Paris</a>. Well, indeed, there is a northern station, there are a lot of gypsies (in real Paris there are more). Architecture has something in common.

If you wander around the center, you can find many beautiful preserved buildings that survived Ceaushima.

<h2>Brașov</h2>
<p>
In the places where the Ceausescu's destruction did not reach, Romania is incredibly, unimaginably beautiful. It is one of the two most beautiful countries in Europe, along with Portugal. If in some Venice or <a href="../croatia">Dubrovnik</a> there is a clear feeling that you are walking through a museum, then in Romania people live their lives in the scenery of fifteenth century, and they don’t even seem to pay attention to it.

<h2>Sinaia</h2>
<p>
One Romanian king decided to build himself a residence outside the city. Disney's "Sleeping Beauty" didn't exist yet, so the architects probably relied on illustrations in old books of children's fairy tales.

<h2>Sighișoara</h2>
<p>
Have you ever heard about the city of Sighișoara? Sighișoara is a fairy tale. It can be put on a par with such magical places as Porto, <a href="../milan">Genoa</a>, <a href="../poland">Gdansk</a>, <a href="../belo-horizonte">Ouro Preto</a> and <a href="../suzdal">Suzdal</a>. Sighișoara is what Europe looked like 500 years ago (only with modern comfort levels). When you approach the center from the station, you think that the only thing missing here is a dragon circling over the rooftops.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254778137_8c2f2a0edd_o.jpg">
<p>
The dragon must have already been killed by the brave knights, and the sun was shining over the city.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254778877_b9685dbd04_o.jpg">
<p>
I was in Sighișoara on the last day (more precisely, the last night and two last days) of a big trip through the Balkans. Before this, I saved for 10 days, lived in hostels, however, in most cities it turned out that there was no one in the room but me, and it was like a four- to eight-bed room for the price of a bed. There is also a hostel in Sighișoara, but I decided to splurge and rent a separate room. It cost ridiculously little money by European standards, less than 20 euros. House in the historical center of Sighișoara.

<h2>Târgu Mureș</h2>
<p>
Târgu Mureș was the last Romanian city on my way. This is one of the most Hungarian cities in Romania (in Hungarian it is called Marosvászarhely, which also means “market on the Mureș River”). Transylvania was part of Hungary and passed to Romania under the Treaty of Trianon after the First World War. Then, during World War II, the Hungarians returned part of the territory (Hungary and Romania were allies of Germany, and Hitler arranged a special arbitration to divide the territory), but not for long. Now Hungarians in Transylvania are already a minority, but visually Târgu Mureș really looks like Hungarian provincial towns.
