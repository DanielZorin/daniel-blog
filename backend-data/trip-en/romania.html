<p>
Trăiască România Mare!

Long Live Romania!

<p>
I crossed the bridge over the Danube and reached the final country in the Balkans.
<p/>

<p>
Here there are gypsy palaces and a lot of other interesting things.

<h2>Bucharest</h2>
<p>
Once upon a time there was a dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu. Somehow it happened that his name became almost a common noun to denote an extravagant tyrant. Perhaps the reason is the stark contrast between the scale of the personality cult of the man who ruled Romania for decades and how quickly and sadly his story ended. Just yesterday he could gather tens of thousands of slaves for a rally, today he is running from the roof of his palace in a helicopter, and tomorrow they will put him up against a wall and shoot him. A typical end for a typical dictator. One of the important results of Ceausescu's rule (as well as communist dictators in other countries) was the destruction of the country's cultural heritage. Ceausescu demolished half of Bucharest to build palaces for himself and his party cronies.
<p/>

<p>
The most famous example is, of course, the Parliament, one of the largest buildings in the world. Why did communist Romania even have a parliament? All the same, deputies were elected on "elections" with one candidate and did not decide anything.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255968411_d14f2f5de4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
As usual, huge wide avenues were laid out.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256169348_bd9d4dfd56_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are kilometers from one building to another.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255239317_09bb3c1cba_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Fountains all over the street.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256169208_827a09393d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Bucharest has its own flattened Stalinist high-rise, the House of the Free Press.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256168513_605a100a0a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Opposite it stood a monument to Lenin, of which only one pedestal remained.
<p/>

<p>
Square of victory.
<p/>

<p>
The roads are wide, but this does not speed up traffic much.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256168353_8d333a4501_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The residential areas of Bucharest are very similar to those in Russia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255238752_44bf62166d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Blocks are built right in the middle of the city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256717279_247047d2ca_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A typical picture for the center of Bucharest - one demolished building stands between the blocks.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257011070_6858f10c56_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is the building from the balcony of which Ceausescu last tried to speak to the crowd. Later he fled from there by helicopter.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256168733_422e969e0d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The stella opposite is a memorial to those killed during the revolution.
<p/>

A typical courtyard a stone's throw from the parliament.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255239197_56de298d28_h.jpg"/>
<p>
If you drive a few stops along the avenue leading from the parliament, you can get to a very interesting place, where another monumental building was supposed to be built, but it didn’t happen.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255239392_95f7c69873_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This place, already overgrown with moss, is a real monument to communism.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255968776_c3a948dc01_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The ground here is cracked from the heat, like in the desert.

Here it is: the fabled "square-nested way of thinking".

<p>
Bucharest is sometimes called little <a href="../paris">Paris</a>. Well, indeed, there is a northern station, there are a lot of gypsies (in real Paris there are more). Architecture has something in common.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255238972_9668c9e6ce_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Also, the street signs here are the same as in Paris.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256168423_fb2a6fa0e9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
If you wander around the center, you can find many beautiful preserved buildings that survived Ceaushima.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256168643_2fccc62a37_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The pointed roofs in Bucharest have something in common with the architecture of Russian cities.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257011570_ccc09131b9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Most of the buildings outside the center itself are practically not restored.

<p>
And in the center, if you look from the side that is not visible at first glance, not everything is good.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257767890_6aecd6b63b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
If we take a wider shot, it won’t be visible.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256168813_9e6f4d074e_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>

<p>
Modern architecture is nothing like that.
<p/>

<p>

The name of Romania comes from the city of Rome (Romania), so in any Romanian city there will be a Capitoline wolf.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257011715_bcfe1c752e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Romania is cheap and tasty. I did not deny myself the pleasure of going to the most famous restaurant, which has existed for more than 100 years.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255968321_1d74bf9d91_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It's worth going to "Caru cu Bere" ("Beer Car") just for the interior.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256717624_8320d144a4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Lunch at this establishment costs about $10.
<p/>

Another gorgeous looking establishment is the Manuc Inn.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255969016_a93a063b13_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a metro in Bucharest.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255969051_afd1a84d8a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Travel costs 20 rubles at a time, or 60 rubles ($2) per day.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257012440_dac26a66c3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The trains are brightly colored.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256718179_6dace74a61_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are also vending machines with books, like in the metro of <a href="../sao-paulo">Sao Paulo</a>.
<p/>

<p>
In Bucharest, like in South America, you can see small children begging among cars stuck in traffic jams.

As in <a href="../moldova">Moldova</a>, in Romania they write on the walls “Bessarabia is Romania!”

Romania has very cool money. TIt is made of polymer, which greatly increases durability and makes it pleasant to the touch.
<p/>

In Romania, two of my favorite carbonated drinks are sold, which are not widely sold in Russia.

<p>
Of all the countries in the Balkans, Romania is closest to Europe in terms of transport. Only here you can normally travel around the country on comfortable (and inexpensive) trains.

<h2>Brașov</h2>
<p>
In the places where the Ceausescu's destruction did not reach, Romania is incredibly, unimaginably beautiful. It is one of the two most beautiful countries in Europe, along with Portugal. If in some Venice or <a href="../croatia">Dubrovnik</a> there is a clear feeling that you are walking through a museum, then in Romania people live their lives in the scenery of fifteenth century, and they don’t even seem to pay attention to it.
<p/>

A tennis court near a house with gabled roofs - what could be better?

No, it's not Disneyland, it's just a gateway to Brașov.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255995122_6b0674ce43_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The beauty is not lost up close.

<p>
If I were the mayor of Brașov, I would ban cars in the city center. No one will die from walking for 15 minutes.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256150643_81fb4a4440_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a huge inscription on a hill above the city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256698809_fce5d47f96_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Just like Hollywood.

<p>
You can take the cable car to the top and walk right behind the letters.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256699084_2869315b90_h.jpg"/>
<p>
From here you can clearly see that in Brașov the beauty is not only in the old town within the walls, but around it too.
<p/>

<p>
Brașov is supposed to have the narrowest street in Europe.
<p/>

<p>
On many surfaces you can see the coat of arms of Brașov with a crown on the roots.

<h2>Sinaia</h2>
<p>
One Romanian king decided to build himself a residence outside the city. Disney's "Sleeping Beauty" didn't exist yet, so the architects probably relied on illustrations in old books of children's fairy tales.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256263734_9ec03f1671_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The result was one of the most fabulous-looking palaces in the world. It’s completely incomprehensible why everyone is rushing to <a href="../munich">Neuschwanstein</a>, and not here?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256263809_20da7da458_h.jpg"/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257031563_1f41a81e30_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The courtiers decided not to lag behind and began to build their palaces nearby.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256263779_1035c2f6b2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And now there is a whole village of luxury buildings.

<h2>Sighișoara</h2>
<p>
Have you ever heard about the city of Sighișoara? Sighișoara is a fairy tale. It can be put on a par with such magical places as Porto, <a href="../milan">Genoa</a>, <a href="../poland">Gdansk</a>, <a href="../belo-horizonte">Ouro Preto</a> and <a href="../suzdal">Suzdal</a>. Sighișoara is what Europe looked like 500 years ago (only with modern comfort levels). When you approach the center from the station, you think that the only thing missing here is a dragon circling over the rooftops.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254778137_196ebb8008_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The dragon must have already been killed by the brave knights, and the sun was shining over the city.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254778877_586783918f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I was in Sighișoara on the last day (more precisely, the last night and two last days) of a big trip through the Balkans. Before this, I saved for 10 days, lived in hostels, however, in most cities it turned out that there was no one in the room but me, and it was like a four- to eight-bed room for the price of a bed. There is also a hostel in Sighișoara, but I decided to splurge and rent a separate room. It cost ridiculously little money by European standards, less than 20 euros. House in the historical center of Sighișoara.

<p>
Sighișoara was originally a German colony (or enclave, as you prefer). Now the cemetery in the old town reminds us of this, as many graves have German names.

<h2>Târgu Mureș</h2>

Târgu Mureș was the last Romanian city on my way. This is one of the most Hungarian cities in Romania (in Hungarian it is called Marosvászarhely, which also means “market on the Mureș River”). Transylvania was part of Hungary and passed to Romania under the Treaty of Trianon after the First World War. Then, during World War II, the Hungarians returned part of the territory (Hungary and Romania were allies of Germany, and Hitler arranged a special arbitration to divide the territory), but not for long. Now Hungarians in Transylvania are already a minority, but visually Târgu Mureș really looks like Hungarian provincial towns.
