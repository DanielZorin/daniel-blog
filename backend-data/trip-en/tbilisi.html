<h1>Georgia: Tbilisi, Mtskheta, Gori</h1>
<i>1-3 April 2014</i>
<h2>Tbilisi</h2>
<p>
The capital of the freest and most democratic state in the CIS is not at all like pretentious Baku. In Tbilisi, even the center is not always in order, but there is a <i>party</i> here. Everything in Tbilisi is so old and soulful that I began to clearly associate this city with Portugal. And visually it looks a bit like Porto when viewed from afar.

<p>
It looks like there are rocks along the river.

<p>
Up close it doesn't look much like Portugal.

Although it all depends on the angle.

The most colorful area in the center is the favela a la <a href="../azerbaijan">Baku</a>.

Adjacent to it is a party area with a huge number of bars. There are more tourists in Tbilisi than in any city in the Caucasus. Under Saakashvili, Georgia had a mega-liberal visa policy: you could stay without a visa for as many as 360 days (for Russians only 90), visa-runs were allowed (you could go from Batumi to Turkey and return for 360 more days), half of the countries had visa-free entry, everyone else had a visa on arrival , and only citizens of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan were required to receive an invitation for a visa. Typically, the hostel where we stayed was run by Indians. Starting this year, the policy is being tightened; now everyone has 90 days every six months.

Georgia is the country of St. George; in European languages it is called Georgia, although initially this name was borrowed from the Persians and attached to the saint later. The Russian name "Gruziya" also comes from Persian.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256117697_7e0c417fe1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In Georgian the country is called "Sakartvelo".

<p>
In general, Georgia’s tourism potential is very high, and they are doing the right thing by developing it. Tourist offers: hotels, excursions, sea. Plus everything is cheap.

There are many streets in Tbilisi lined with cobblestones, and they are quite small, so it is not very convenient to walk.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257045463_74bc4eaf75_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The gateways are like in <a href="../lithuania">Vilnius</a>, only with a bunch of advertisements.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256357189_f9856d647d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The main street is decorated with a huge number of sculptures.

<p>
And just 23 years ago there were battles with tanks and machine gun fire.

If the first president of Georgia, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, had remained alive, he could have written the book “How to ruin a country and bring it to civil war in six months.” Georgia was in the forefront of those who wanted to leave the USSR, along with the Baltic states. A significant role in this was played by the forceful dispersal of the demonstration on Rustaveli Avenue in 1989 (Tragedy of April 9), although before that Georgia had never been particularly loyal to the union authorities.
<p/>

<p>
Gamsakhurdia was... well, like if Yarosh were the president of Ukraine. He was going to throw out all the occupiers from Georgia, which included not only Russians, but also Ossetians, Abkhazians, as well as Azerbaijanis and Armenians who lived along the borders of the respective republics. The then Minister of Press of Russia wrote this: “Gamsakhurdia instructed me in a fatherly way: Why is the central government getting in the way of Russia? The Soviet Union no longer exists. Relocate this power somewhere to Magadan.” He looked serious at the same time. I couldn’t stand it and said that we agree to transfer the Kremlin to Magadan, provided that Zviad invites Meskhetian refugees to Georgia. Gamsakhurdia pretended not to notice the teasing and dreamily said: “If we jointly deport all Ossetians from South Ossetia to Siberia, I will let several Turkish families." When Yeltsin signed the Almaty agreements, Gamsakhurdia was already sitting in a bunker and firing back from the army that overthrew him. Then he fled to Chechnya, and a year later he returned, started a civil war in the western regions of Georgia, but again he lost everything and died under murky circumstances. The former Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR Shevardnadze became president, however, the cleansing of communist symbols in Georgia went off with a bang, not a single monument to Lenin remained, and the hammer and sickle were removed from the parliament house, although for some reason the star remained.

The president's residence is more impressive.

There is a competition of caricatures of Stalin on the walls of Tbilisi.

But before it was in Russian, and due to an oversight it still remains in some places.

They installed a board with information about buses, although minibuses have not yet become obsolete.
<p/>

<p>
Here they even name the streets after American officials, just like in Kosovo. There is also George Bush Street.

The Azerbaijanis also reached here with their monument to Heydar Aliyev.

<p>
In general, despite all the shortcomings, things have definitely become much better in Georgia now than ten years ago, when potbelly stoves were heated in the center of Tbilisi in winter.

<h2>Mtskheta</h2>
<p>
By chance, I found myself at the scene of my least favorite work of Russian literature.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255783552_34483ed702_h.jpg"/>
<p>
If I appreciated things like “A Hero of Our Time” with age (I think that studying these books by schoolchildren aged 13-15 is absolutely pointless, since at most 10% of children may like it), then “Mtsyri” (by M. Lermontov) remained gray for me.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256712643_95811a8120_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Modern Mtskheta is a small town in which the main cathedral of the Georgian Orthodox Church is located.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257258924_5af202c1dc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are several beautiful streets around the monastery.
<p/>

<p>
Then the tile ends and the village begins.
<p/>

<p>
The cross was leaned against the wall in the corner.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257258789_7dc7df8803_h.jpg"/>
<p>
That monastery where "Mtsyri" story took place is located on a high mountain on the other side of the river. You can go there by taxi for only 300 rubles ($10), including waiting time.

On the way back, the car got into a crowd of sheep crossing the road.

<h2>Gori</h2>
<p>
I have already talked about <a href="../austria">Hitler’s hometown</a>, now it’s time to look at the hometown of his main opponent - Stalin. For the dictator-combo, I need to visit the homeland of Mao Zedong in China.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256134571_e102eb2829_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In general, Stalin is not favored in Georgia, but this does not apply to Gori. The local residents are apparently proud that their fellow countryman has achieved such success.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257177705_1bbb28fc10_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The house where Stalin was born was clad in granite.
<p/>

Opposite is a large museum where you can see several more monuments to Stalin.

The title “professional revolutionary” is touching, just like a professional oppositionist <s>from the Maidan</s>.

<p>
Although modern admirers admire how humble, silver-free Stalin was, during his lifetime the cult was greater than that of any African banana dictator. In all the cities there were monuments to the leader, which, of course, were erected not without his knowledge. In 1956-1962, almost all the monuments to Stalin were demolished, only two remained: in one distant Tajik village, which was simply forgotten, and in Gori. Later, under Brezhnev, the deification of Lenin (as well as the cult of Victory) was launched in the USSR, erecting dozens of monuments in each village. And the monument to Stalin in Gori stood for quite a long time, until it was demolished one night already under Saakashvili. He stood in this square.

In general, there are no fewer fortresses in Georgia than in Spain or France.

Elections are coming. In Georgia, candidates hang rows of identical posters with their names on them.
