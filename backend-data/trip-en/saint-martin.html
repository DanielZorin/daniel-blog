<h1>Saint Martin</h1>
<i>14 November 2016</i>
<p>
The French part of Saint Martin is very different from the Dutch one. It’s an amazing thing - on a small island on another continent with a transparent border, two cities are so different from each other. There are no border controls in Saint Martin, the border looks like this.

The capital of Saint Martin is called Marigot. The sign is exactly like in France.

I enter the city and the first thing I see is the Monop supermarket. This is not America; you don’t have to travel 20 kilometers out of town to get a supermarket.

The choice is simply divine, especially for a small island.

Incredibly, mangosteens and rambutans are even brought here from Southeast Asia! 13 euros per kilo.

I bought myself a baguette and Camembert, as I always do in France. By the way, prices are indicated in euros, but you can pay in dollars, and at a rate of 1 to 1: I had to pay 4.95 euros, gave 5 dollars, and also received a coin of 5 euro cents in change!

Just like in France, there are roundabouts everywhere.

Restaurant. Prices are not low, as in French tourist places - from 10 to 15 euros. But it’s still two times cheaper than in the USA.

From here, ferries run many times a day to the neighboring island of Anguilla, which is a British colony, but with a Russian passport you need a visa.
