<h1>China: Guilin, Yangshuo, Nanning, Zhanjiang, Haikou, Sanya</h1>

<h2>Guilin</h2>
<p>
Many pass through this city without stopping, heading straight to the neighboring town of Yangshuo, but there is also something to see in Guilin. There are karst hills everywhere in this area, only in Guilin they are among a more urban landscape, since it is still a rather large city.
<p/>

<p>
As in all popular tourist cities, in Guilin they can easily accommodate foreigners in any cheap hotel. Near the reception there is a funny poster calling for checking guests' passports and not letting bearded Uyghur terrorists in.

<p>
As in many cities, in Guilin there are old five-story buildings in the center, and modern high-rise buildings on the outskirts.

The mango season has begun; they sell for 10-12 yuan per kilogram.

Central Market. There are a lot of tourists here and they sell mostly all sorts of unusual snacks.

<p>
Let's move on to the sights. This is not easy in Guilin. Since there are a lot of tourists here, the prices are too high, so don’t play around. They charge 60-80 yuan for entry anywhere, which means if you go everywhere you can simply go broke. It’s good that you can at least look at the pagodas from the outside for free.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256353833_fc5f7e2494_o.jpg">
<p>
The main attraction in the city center is a karst hill that looks like an elephant's trunk. Entrance 70 yuan. This is the elephant. They took a thorough approach to fencing the area: trees were planted on the embankment opposite to make it inconvenient to take selfies.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255424957_8f1ba723dd_o.jpg">
<p>
The area is tightly fenced with barbed wire.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255425002_deedc2ee2a_o.jpg">
<p>
In general, in China they usually don’t bother with fencing that much. Apparently, they’ve become quite impudent here in charging 70 yuan for viewing the rocks.
<p/>

When the wire runs out, you can watch it for free, albeit from afar.
<p/>

<p>
There are also several hills to climb. I read that entrance to Changshan seems to be free, but at the entrance to the park there is also a ticket office with tickets for 70 yuan, although a lot of people passed there apparently without tickets (there is also a regular road going past the hill). We decided to try to climb for free. Oops! The path up was easy to find.

<p>
At some point, the path ended, then it was possible to climb the rocks for a while, then it became too difficult, so we had to turn back.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256154981_eb21818e24_o.jpg">
<p>
On the way we went into a cave to cool off. In theory, this cave is through, but I did not dare to check.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257197810_08c0b0f469_o.jpg">
<p>
It was already five o'clock in the evening, and the ticket office at the entrance had already closed. It was possible to enter the park without any problems.

The ticket office at the entrance is clearly an unofficial one, because on the other side the park is not even fenced in any way, you can enter freely.
<p/>

I still didn’t understand where the climb to this pagoda was, although I walked around the hill in a circle.

In my opinion, my time in Guilin was very informative and interesting, and I spent a minimum of money.
<p/>
<h2>Yangshuo</h2>
<p>
Yangshuo is lovely. The city is small, sandwiched between all these karst mountains, you can admire the scenery up close on any street. Directly from the bus station itself.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256498989_664b850453_o.jpg">
<p>
It’s best to check in near the bus station: transport is nearby, the center is a 20-minute walk, exit from the city is nearby (if you go by bicycle), an excellent room with no problems with check-in and no haggling for 80 yuan, whereas in the center you will be charged 50 yuan for a bed in a hostel. In general, in China you can live in a hostel only if it is vital for you to drink beer every day with backpackers.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255749951_41daf98035_o.jpg">
<p>
In Yangshuo there are noticeably more attempts to translate signs into English.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255952808_75a13ced68_o.jpg">
<p>
In general, the center is quite rotten: an unreal crowd and generally no place to eat properly.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256499414_523cff8098_o.jpg">
<p>
Usually on tourist streets they at least sell some goodies from stalls, but not here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256499464_10c60f71e4_o.jpg">
<p>
Here they sell German sausages for two euros. Well, in Germany they cost about the same, of course, but here it’s strange.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256499389_afd8e1fcd1_o.jpg">
<p>
For 30-38 yuan you can get two excellent meat dishes or something completely exotic and very tasty, rather than one dry toast with scrambled eggs and 100 grams of fruit.
But the second announcement is very interesting. It turns out that an English teacher receives more than $1,000 a month and also free food and housing, that is, he lives better than 99% of the Russian population (except for top programmers, directors and Putin’s friends). Moreover, they only work 15-20 hours a week! In my opinion, if there is no way to make money online, this is a very good option, much better than working for similar money in expensive Australia picking fruit, as Americans and Europeans do.
However, no one needs Russian language teachers. But if you know English well, then you can also get a job, just not in popular tourist cities.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255021092_94c952b756_o.jpg">
<p>
In general, you can skip the center, especially since Yangshuo is not a historical city; there is no ancient architecture here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256794445_760233c558_o.jpg">
<p>
Looks nice though.
<p/>

<p>
There are not many attractions in the city itself. Usually from here people float along the river on rafts (very expensive) or ride around the surrounding area on bicycles (very cheap). There is one mountain in the very center that you can climb for a lot of money, but there is a better alternative: a hill with a TV tower. It is close to the center, quite high (it takes 30-40 minutes to climb the stairs). They let you in there not entirely officially; the gatekeeper collects 20 yuan without any tickets. Finding the road is also not very easy: the beginning of the stairs is located deep in a residential area with narrow streets. In some places there are signs (in this photo there is a white A4 piece of paper).

Upstairs, Chinese students were sitting on the roof of an abandoned booth, drinking beer.

By the way, the surrounding area of Yangshuo is depicted on the 20 yuan banknote. There is an exact place where this photograph was taken, this is the village of Xingping, to which you need to drive 30 kilometers to the north. I've been to all the cities with Russian banknotes, and now I've seen almost all the sights on Chinese ones: West Lake in Hangzhou (1 yuan), <a href="../tianjin">Taishan</ a> (5 yuan), Yangtze Gorges (10 yuan), Yangshuo (20 yuan) and Parliament Building (100 yuan). The only thing left is the Dalai Lama's palace in Lhasa (50 yuan).

<p>
On the second day I had to work a lot, so I only went out for a walk after lunch. I chose the village of Fuli, it is only 15 kilometers from the center of Yangshuo, and you can get there by public transport. There are minibuses running around the area almost like in Russia, but you can also find more archaic transport. If you wish, you can even ride in a cargo trailer.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256499549_017a9258a4_o.jpg">
<p>
There are also tourists in Fuli, but this has little effect on appearance.

The most convenient way to explore the beauty around Yangshuo is by bicycle. Walking distances are too long, and you can rent a bicycle for only 20 yuan per day (three dollars). In the city center it is 3-5 times more expensive, so the best place is near the bus station. Plus, it’s just close to the exit from the city, so you don’t have to go through the center, where there are quite a lot of cars. Since I got on a bicycle for the second time in my life, riding on a busy road was scary; in this regard, a rural road is much more convenient.

Many hills can be climbed using climbing equipment if desired; similar ascents are organized in Yangshuo. For some reason they hung teddy bears on this hill.

There was a route marked on the Baidu map that allowed us to take a shortcut and avoid going through the busy city center. On this path, cars suddenly disappear, and you find yourself in the middle of nowhere.

<p>
There was a fork here. On one side the road ended at the closed gate of some farm, but at least there were traces of cars (or tractors). In the other direction, where the road should have been according to the map, there was a barely noticeable dirt road.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256795665_c781b44c23_o.jpg">

It was unreasonable to drag a bicycle through off-road terrain that was unclear when it would end, so I had to turn back. Riding through the city center was surprisingly easy and uneventful.

<h2>Nanning</h2>
<p>
Nanning is the largest city closest to the border with Vietnam. The proximity of Vietnam is evident in the huge number of motorcycles on the streets.
<p/>

And most importantly, there is a whole ice cream shop near the exit! All these refrigerators have different types of ice cream, and all are very cheap, as low as 1 yuan.

<h2>Zhanjiang</h2>
<p>
Getting to Hainan Island is not so easy. Planes there are not very cheap. There are trains that load entire cars directly onto ferries. It would be interesting to travel, but there are very few of these trains, they run at inconvenient times, and are very expensive even for a short segment of the journey between the mainland and the island. After a long meditation on the railway map, I discovered the city of Zhanjiang in Guangdong Province, which is close to Hainan and has many trains.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255045932_5d34e59fa2_o.jpg">

Zhanjiang was a French colony in the 19th century, but this is not particularly noticeable now. There are a couple of seemingly colonial buildings on the waterfront.

From here there are buses to the ferry crossing to Hainan.
<p/>
<h2>Haikou</h2>
<p>
The ferry to Hainan looks very impressive. It even transports trucks, but the entire upper deck is given over to passengers.

Coconuts are sold everywhere here. One costs seven yuan (~$1), for that price you can get it, although I don’t particularly like coconuts: there is not enough water and it is sour, and there is also little pulp, it is a chore to peel it off, and it is also quite tasteless. Maybe it was the comparison of the taste of real coconut with the taste of Bounty chocolate that caused me such disappointment?

Finding a hotel was not easy. At some point, out of desperation, I went to a very reputable hotel with prices starting from 150 yuan, but even there they refused. But in reality, everything is not so bad: you can stay in the private apartment, it’s just that the Chinese word for “rent a room by the sea” in hieroglyphs does not look like the word “hotel”, and at first I simply did not notice such signs. In the private sector you can rent a room for the standard 80 yuan.

I wanted to relax for a week on the beach in Hainan, but somehow it didn’t work out. On the very first day, both Alena and I, having spent about 30 minutes on the beach in the open sun, got so burned that we spent the entire evening and the next day in bed (instead of going to the city of Sanya). I didn’t take my camera, so there were no photographs left of the ill-fated Haikou beach. More precisely, there are night ones left, which I did when I was able to get up.
<p/>

All that remained was to taste different dishes. Once I randomly pointed at a cheap dish (less than 15 yuan) on the menu, being too lazy to translate its name. It turned out to be a sweet, fluffy corn pie.

Carefully putting on my backpack, I was able to get to the bus station, from where I could leave for Sanya.
<p/>
<h2>Sanya</h2>
<p>
Direct charters fly to Hainan Island from Russia, I even remember advertising in the Moscow metro, and for Siberia this is generally an analogue of Turkey. If you fly to Hainan directly, you don’t even need a visa to China. Based on the reviews, I expected it to be something like <a href="../cyprus">Cyprus</a>, but no. Sanya is a real Chinese city with all the attributes, low prices, a huge beautiful empty beach. Overall, this is a very good, comfortable resort, I was pleasantly surprised.

Finding a hotel is not a problem at all. Right next to the bus, as in Crimea, you are greeted by grandmothers who rent out rooms with all amenities for 80 yuan. The beach is 5 minutes away. Here's the view from my window at night.

At the same time, there are almost no Russians themselves. There are Chinese everywhere, even dancing in the park by the sea in the evening.

Before I had time to enjoy the beautiful beach in Sanya, having just recovered from my burns, it was time to leave. Hainan is a logistical dead end; traveling from there by train towards Guangzhou is very long, tedious, and not particularly cheaper than flying. So I bought a plane ticket a couple of weeks in advance. In general, flights from Haikou are cheaper, but you still need to get to Haikou, it’s at least 80 yuan by bus, or more than 100 by train. Choosing between Haikou-Nanchang for 450 yuan and Sanya-Xiamen for 600 yuan, I preferred the second option so that I could see Xiamen and not have to travel back to Haikou.
The flight to Xiamen was operated by Shandong Airlines, based in Jinan (after Xiamen the plane flies there). The route map of this small regional airline looks very impressive.

On the plane on TV they showed a Chinese humor show. I remember the scene about how a hard worker sits on a bench with a Chinese hipster in a yellow jacket and starts arguing with him: the hipster takes out a Big Mac, the hard worker takes out a sausage sandwich, and so on.
