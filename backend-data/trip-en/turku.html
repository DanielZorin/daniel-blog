<h1>Finland: Helsinki, Turku</h1>
<i>4 January 2017</i>
<h2>Helsinki</h2>
<p>
Finland was the starting point for a trip to Italy from St. Petersburg. The winter was mild, but just at the very beginning of January it got sharply cold, in Finland it dropped to -20. Helsinki is covered in snow.

I needed a flight from Turku to Gdansk and then to board from Gdansk to Milan, all this for little money despite January 4th being the peak date. Accordingly, from Helsinki I went to Turku for three euros on Onnibus. My clothes, already ready for Italy, were clearly not designed for -20. From the bus station to the bus stop we had to move in dashes, hitting every store or ATM.

Buses to the airport pass through the central square of Turku.

The airport is very small, there are 5-7 flights per day. Surprisingly, most of the flights are to Helsinki, although it only takes about two hours to get there by bus.
