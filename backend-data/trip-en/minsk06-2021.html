<h1>Belarus: Minsk</h1>
<i>5 June 2021</i>
<h2>Minsk</h2>
<p>
<i>
— Wonderful room, with all amenities. And I'll not charge a lot. Fifty rubles a month.
“I won’t bargain,” Ostap said politely, “but the neighbors... How are they?”
“Wonderful people,” answered Vasisualiy, “and all the amenities in general. And the price is cheap.”
“But they seem to have introduced corporal punishment in this apartment?”
“Ah,” said Lokhankin soulfully, “after all, who knows! Maybe this is how it should be! Maybe this is precisely the great homespun truth!”
</i>
This fragment from The Golden Calf kept playing in my head that day. I didn’t want to experience corporal punishment myself, so I checked in advance that I didn’t have a combination of white and red anywhere on me. I needed to spend half a day in Minsk, and then take the train to Moscow.

On the way from the airport, the bus passes through almost all the main squares of the city.

There is a small pedestrian area here, I had not paid attention to it before, perhaps because I have always been to Minsk in winter, when the verandas are not open.
