<h1>Kosovo: Prizren, Peja, Pristina</h1>
<i>3-4 July 2014</i>
<h2>Prizren</h2>
<p>
In Russian media sympathetic to Serbia, Kosovo is demonized as the center of crime and drug trafficking in Europe. A visiting tourist, free from stereotypes, is unlikely to have a negative impression of this country; it is no worse or more dangerous than other countries in this part of Europe.
Russia does not recognize Kosovo, but recognizes <a href="../south-ossetia">South Ossetia</a>, and the United States recognizes Kosovo, but does not recognize South Ossetia. In general, both have double standards. From a practical point of view, the return of Kosovo to Serbia is not possible. Here, even before the war, the Serbs were in a clear minority, but now there are almost none of them left outside the northern part controlled by Serbia. The unpleasant thing is that citizens of countries that do not recognize Kosovo, including Russia, need a visa (a few years ago Kosovo was the most open and friendly country in the world, not requiring visas even from Somali citizens). This is not a big obstacle for experienced travelers, because they are allowed in with a Schengen visa.

Prizren is the oldest and most beautiful city in Kosovo.

It is very important for the Albanians because here is the place (a house with a large round courtyard) where in the 19th century representatives of the Albanians first gathered and decided to fight for national autonomy.

The fortress from which I photographed all this is in complete desolation. You can climb everywhere, like in <a href="../chechnya">Derbent</a>.

Let's see what Kosovo looks like up close. Firstly, no other country in Europe has so many American flags. The USA is held in high esteem here.
<p/>

<p>
Kosovo is a young country, and its heroes are also from recent history. There are, of course, ancient Albanian figures, but famous Kosovars are our contemporaries. There are monuments to tough men with machine guns everywhere.
<p/>

<p>
In Kosovo, the idea of ​​a Greater Albania is in the air. In Albania itself you won’t see maps of Greater Albania on the streets, but here you can.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256666616_fcf2dffd59_o.jpg">
<p>
Greater Albania includes, in addition to Albania and Kosovo, parts of Macedonia, Greece, Serbia and Montenegro.

There is almost no Serbian heritage in Kosovo, except for the sewer manholes.

Kosovo does not have its own currency, they use the euro (as in neighboring Montenegro).

You can see tangles of wires here, like in Albania, but unlike anywhere in the former Yugoslavia.

Thank you notes are written on the city hall building in different languages. Not in Russian, because Russia does not recognize Kosovo.

<h2>Peja</h2>
<p>
In the town of Peja (Pec in Serbian) is the main monastery of the Serbian Orthodox Church, one of the blockers in relations between Kosovo and Serbia. Kosovo was once inhabited by Serbs, which is why this monastery was built there, but for the last hundred years the Serbs have been in the minority there. The monastery was fenced off to keep it out of harm's way with a high fence.
<p/>

There is a checkpoint at the entrance; people with weapons are not allowed.

<p>
A woman with a Serbian surname is running in the elections. I wonder if such people in Serbia are considered heroes because they stayed in Kosovo, or traitors because they cooperate with the occupation authorities?
<p/>

In general, Pec is an Albanian city. The market is like in Turkey.

They also hang obituaries here, for some reason in a red frame.

<h2>Pristina</h2>
<p>
Kosovo is the worst dream of any Russian imperialist. You go out onto the street of NATO General Walker.
<p/>

You turn onto the boulevard in honor of some American senator.

Next is Clinton Street.

<p>
Remember Tskhinvali, where <a href="../south-ossetia">Putin Street and Medvedev Street</a> intersect? In the capital of Kosovo, the main street is called Clinton Street.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255937722_295bd362ee_o.jpg">
<p>
The second main street, running perpendicular to Clinton Street, is George Bush Street (the younger one, who probably recognized the independence of Kosovo). It's a pity that there is no double sign on the crossing.

Behgjet Pacolli is running in the elections. He might be remembered by history buffs of the 90s as the head of the Mabetex company.

I decided to try to get inside and discovered that the church was fenced with barbed wire, and inside there was a whole warehouse of strange things. You can climb over the wire on the side, but I didn’t.

The most important feature of Pristina is that it has the youngest population in Europe, and therefore it is one of the best party places in the Balkans. In the evening the main street is crowded.
