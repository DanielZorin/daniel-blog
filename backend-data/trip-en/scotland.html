<h1>United Kingdom: Edinburgh, Glen Coe, Loch Ness, Glasgow</h1>
<i>6-8 October 2019</i>
<h2>Edinburgh</h2>
<p>
Scotland occupies the northern mountainous part of the main British island. The Romans were unable to conquer this region, and for defense they fenced off from it with Hadrian's Wall. Scotland remained independent for a long time, despite an attempted English conquest in the late 13th century. Eventually, in 1603, King James VI of Scotland inherited the English throne and the two countries were united under a single government, albeit with different laws. A hundred years later, the formation of the United Kingdom was officially proclaimed, which exists to this day. In 2014, Scotland held a referendum on independence, but 55% voted against it.

<p>
The weather was terrible most of the time, which meant I saw less of Edinburgh than I would have liked.

At the exit, a sign reminds you to drive on the left side.

<p>
If you walk 1 kilometer from the airport to the penultimate tram station, the fare will be several times cheaper.

<p>
Due to the constant rain and the characteristic color of the buildings, I remember Edinburgh as a black, black city.

<p>
The city center consists of two parts, called Old and New. They are separated by a ravine, along which a railway partially runs. The new city was built on a grid with straight streets and monuments in squares.

Gothic monument to the writer Walter Scott. This is one of the most famous writers in Scotland, like Pushkin in Russia.

The old town is on the other side of the park on a hill.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256832684_c997b694f4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At some point the hill turns into a steep cliff, on top of which stands the castle.

From the New Town to the Old Town you need to go through the railway station.
<p/>

<p>
In the old town, the streets are not as straight, as befits a medieval city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256832059_fb70621178_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The main street, the Royal Mile, goes straight to the castle.

At some point, Edinburgh becomes three-dimensional - it’s like you’re walking down a street, and another street is perpendicular to you.

The National Monument of Scotland was supposed to be pretentious, like a Roman temple, but all the money was wasted and the construction remained half completed.

I didn’t live in the very center of Edinburgh; it was a 30-40 minute walk or a few stops by bus. Nearby was the building of Stuarts Melville College - no worse than in Oxford.
<p/>

<p>
Judging by the views along the way, there is still a lot of such beauty in Edinburgh. I would like to visit this city again and see it in more detail.

<h2>Loch Ness</h2>
<p>
Scotland is famous for its mountainous landscapes in the northern part of this region. I couldn't rent a car, so the only option was to take a tour from Edinburgh.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255643227_6b96c0d22f_h.jpg"/>

<p>
We were not very lucky with the weather in the first half of the day; it was truly Scottish (that is, it was raining). In the afternoon, however, there was not a cloud in the sky.

The Caledonian Canal runs here, connecting the east and west coasts of Scotland. Most of the route goes along long, elongated lakes located on the site of glacial valleys; between them, pieces with locks were only completed so that you could pass through.

<h2>Glasgow</h2>
<p>
Glasgow is the largest city in Scotland and very from the capital. If in Edinburgh there is solemn architecture, monuments, a palace, a lot of tourists, in Glasgow at first glance there is none of this, it is such a working class city.
<p/>

<p>
The most significant thing for me was that on the main pedestrian street there were three stores in a row from different “Everything for 1 pound” chains, when in the center of Edinburgh there are hardly any (as in the center of London, by the way).
