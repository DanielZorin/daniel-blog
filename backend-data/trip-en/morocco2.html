<h1>Morocco: Rabat, Sale</h1>
<i>30 September - 1 October 2012</i>
<h2>Rabat</h2>
<p>
For some reason, most people avoid Rabat. It’s a long way to travel here from Fez/Meknes, Tangier, and Marrakech, and transfers between these cities are usually made in Casablanca. But the city is very pleasant, cleaner, better infrastructure, many very decent neighborhoods. Beautiful views. And at the same time - much cheaper than Casablanca.

Rabat Station is similar to a train station.

It turned out that in Morocco even the two existing railway lines cannot be organized so that the trains are not late. Instead of an hour from Casablanca, it took two hours. It is worth noting that the delay was not announced in advance; moreover, the loudspeakers on the train did not seem to be working, and the change was announced by a person passing through the carriages. Since everyone was put on another train, there was a problem with seats; we had to ride in the luggage compartment.

Trains in Morocco are apparently being written off from all over Europe. I saw repainted two-story German ones (the same ones in Lithuania and similar ones in Madrid), Dutch ones with transparent compartments, Czech ones with rows of armchairs, Spanish ones with tables and all sorts of hybrids.

In Rabat itself, transport is organized much better than in Casablanca. There are two tram lines, for which you can buy a ticket (not cheap, about $1) from a machine at the stop using a credit card. Buses have numbers and you can see a full list of stops.

Rabat is similar to Casablanca in the color of the houses and decoration.

Here is the residence of the king, surrounded by a huge fence. Photography is not allowed near it.

On the opposite side of the Bourgreg River is the city of Sale, a place where those who do not have enough money to live in Rabat live.

During the day there are few people there, everyone is at work or hanging out in Rabat.

Lots of shabby houses.

Tourists are not welcome here; all menus in restaurants are only in Arabic. Signs for the most part too.

<p>
In Sale you can see dead ends, similar to the back streets of Marrakesh.
<p/>

<p>
In these dead ends there are entrances to the entrances of houses.

<p>
The dwellings appear to extend further back from the street. Rare windows have massive bars.

Adults prefer to spend the day in street cafes. The local tradition is to take a cup of coffee with a glass of water and mix it. This drink is on the table of every first visitor to the cafe.

You can eat in a snack bar under the shadow of a portrait of the king. They serve roast for $2-3.

What always amazes me in southern countries is how people manage to walk around in a leather coat in thirty-degree heat.

Morocco is not a country where you want to return again and again, but it’s worth visiting once.
