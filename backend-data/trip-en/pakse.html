<h1>Laos: Don Det, Don Khon, Champatsak, Pakse, Bolaven Plateau, Savannakhet</h1>
<i>23-29 December 2015</i>
<h2>Four thousand Islands</h2>
<p>
On the border of Laos and Cambodia, the Mekong River breaks into many small streams, between which lie islands. Some of them are inhabited, in particular the island of Don Det, on which a recreational area with hotels and restaurants is organized.
<p/>

<p>
I've heard claims that the crowd moved here after Vang Vieng closed, but that's not true. At night the village is quiet and calm, there is no discotheque, except that the presence of "lucky" menu items hints at fun.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256810764_0fd35dfb02_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also tubing, a signature Laotian entertainment. This is a ride along the river on a big wheel or lifebuoy with a beer. Although it is more interesting to go kayaking.
<p/>

<p>
In terms of infrastructure, the village has many hotels and restaurants. Restaurant prices are high (as in other tourist places), but if you go further from the pier, prices drop to normal. I found a hotel for $3.5 with the slogan “Our rooms are modest, but we have a big heart.”
<p/>

<p>
This is currently a record for the cheapest hotel for me. For three and a half dollars, the conditions here are quite decent: a small house, a large bed, a mosquito net (a useful device that is often missing), and an attached shower. There is no hot water, but during the day it is quite warm as it is heated by the sun. Electricity works normally (there were problems with this on the island before, because the supply came from generators). There is a hammock hanging at the entrance, where you can catch the Wi-Fi of the neighboring restaurant.
<p/>

<p>
There are no ATMs on the island, but you can make a cash advance with a decent commission (5 percent). Cash currency exchange is also at a not very favorable rate, 5 percent lower than the real one. I didn’t find SIM cards for sale, I bought them later in Pakse. Stores generally do not offer a large assortment. Another disadvantage is the high prices for travel from the islands. You most likely won’t be able to leave on your own, because the boats depart only at one time, when tourists are taken out of the island. For example, I bought a ticket from Banlung to Don Det, including a boat, for $12, which I considered very expensive for a three-hour journey. On Don Det, a ticket to Banlung sells for $18. The two hour journey to Pakse costs almost $9.

<p>
There is a small beach where boats dock. You can swim, the water is clean. The current is strong in places.
<p/>

<p>
The scenery around is pleasant.

Behind the tourist village there are agricultural lands and houses of local residents.
<p/>

<p>
The pompous arch remains from colonial times. The trucks behind it are local public transport! They bring children from the island to school.

Fields and cows. The island can be crossed on foot in about 40 minutes.
<p/>

<p>
Don Det is connected by this bridge to the neighboring island of Don Khon.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256263838_680ac88ae2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Old rails lie nearby. This is no accident.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256810914_1ee26fd08d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The fact is that until recently the only railway in Laos was located here. (They recently built a couple of kilometers of extension of the rails from Thailand across the border near Vientiane, without reaching Vientiane itself). Why do they need a railway on some island in the middle of the river? The Mekong's 4,000 islands have high rapids, making it impossible to sail up or down the river. The only option is to drag the boat (or its cargo) overland through Don Khon. To facilitate this task, the French built a railway. Now all that remains of it is a rusty locomotive and the remains of rails, because the cargo can be transported along the road along the Mekong.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255333457_5edd0f02ad_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And here are the rapids themselves, which are not entirely correctly called waterfalls.

There is a beach downstream.

<p>
And here the current is very strong.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256264063_d33cde52de_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are also villages on Don Khon. Laotian villages look poor, almost all houses are wooden.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255333732_cf3f863770_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Even the school is made of wood.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256264113_bd97342b6d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Restaurant. Like Cambodia, Laos has standardized restaurant signs, only here they are yellow. In Cambodia three brands of beer compete, but here there is autocracy - Beerlao rules.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257107305_c3de85ff15_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The temple is similar to its Thai counterparts.
<p/>

<p>
The 4000 Islands are a good place for a relaxing holiday.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256264173_eaac904f03_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You can relax in a hammock all day and go watch the sunset in the evening.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257107430_c9228bd0c2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Many people do this.

<h2>Champatsak</h2>
<p>
Once the capital of the region, Champatsak today is just a village: one street and wooden houses. It differs from any other village only in the presence of several hotels, which are there because the Khmer era temple, Wat Phu, has been preserved nearby.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255272402_bf795a552a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Tuk-Tuk wants as much as 10 dollars for a 10-kilometer round trip. Actually, there is no other way for a tuk-tuk driver to earn money here; who else in the village would need a taxi? I thought about offering to split the price with a couple of Europeans who checked into the same hotel, but they somehow left very quickly (and I thought they were poor, since they checked into a room with a fan for 5 dollars, and I with an air conditioner for 10). The solution to the problem was simple - rent two bicycles for a dollar and ride on your own.

<p>
There are two large lakes at the entrance.

<p>
It takes a long time to walk up the stairs up the hill.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256001466_5293b9993b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And the temple itself is very modest.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255272057_e58b6c3bb3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Contrastes with the pathos of the stairs.

They are also building piles of stones here.

We drove back mostly after sunset. There is not a lot of lighting in the city, but the main problem is that midges become active and crash on your face when you drive.

<h2>Pakse</h2>
<p>
Pakse is the first semblance of a city in Laos. Although there is less than 100 thousand population, the city is one of the three largest in Laos.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255883437_b977d9b61b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At least there is not just one street, but a city center where there is a grid of streets intersecting at angles. And then, anyway, one street stretches for ten kilometers, along which are all the buildings. And there are buildings with more than one floor.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257654195_d845a088a2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are bus stops in Pakse, but this is a foundation for the distant future - there is really no public transport in the city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256611116_eb9a479825_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You can finally buy a SIM card in Pakse. There is a Beeline branch in Laos.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257358154_1b553bd283_h.jpg"/>
<p>
"I love Laos." But Beeline only has coverage in cities, so this is not the best option.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257358529_aa0e1423c8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is Lao Telecom, but it has the highest prices.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257654285_954d8998fa_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I went to the Unitel office and it was empty. For half an hour no one came; I could have stolen all their computers if I wanted. In the end, I bought a SIM card from a kiosk and activated it myself.

There is even some semblance of architecture in the center.

There is a bus station in the city center from where the king of buses leaves.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256812333_2180475b13_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The king of buses travels to Vientiane at night. If you're alone, I don't recommend riding it unless you want to share your bunk with a mysterious stranger.
Although Pakse is a small town, there are at least three more bus stations, two of which are located about 30 kilometers from the center. Given the lack of transport in the city, getting there will be more expensive than then traveling the whole country by bus.
<p/>

At one corner they made juice from sugar cane.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255883792_d4705ebbad_h.jpg"/>
<p>
For a modest price they poured a huge glass, no less than a liter. This is generally a feature of Laos - always large portions.
<p/>

<h2>Bolaven Plateau</h2>
<p>
In the case of the Bolaven Plateau, I took the easy route and took a guided tour. In all Pakse agencies it costs 150 thousand kip ($18), this is for travel everywhere by minibus and entrance tickets. You can go on your own by motorcycle, but the cheapest one in Pakse costs more than $10 a day, and by motorcycle the route is more likely to take two days than one, because there are many stops. The first point of the program is two high waterfalls located nearby.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255206407_f488b2b817_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Then a coffee plantation. The Bolaven Plateau is known as the place where the grains for Lao's signature drink are grown. I've never seen coffee grow before.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256979400_f0a22075ba_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are two varieties - Arabica and Robusta.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256137448_a38ff5fc98_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In addition to coffee, this farm contains samples of various other plants. For example, this is how pineapples grow. I knew, but before that I had only seen it in pictures.
<p/>

<p>
Then, as part of a cultural program, we were brought to the village. Just a village with a new school.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256979580_4ad70b8f92_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And this is an ordinary village, they don’t even sell any souvenirs.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256137598_7de7c39fd7_h.jpg"/>

Opposite the village council they placed shells that were abundantly dropped on Laos during the civil war by the Americans, who seemed to have only been in Vietnam.

Then there were several more short stops in local villages. Some residents here have a tradition of making themselves a coffin in advance and storing it under the floor of the house.

There is little traffic on the highway. Locals mostly ride all sorts of mutants.

<h2>Savannakhet</h2>
<p>
Savannakhet stands out in Laos for three reasons. Firstly, it looks like a city, which is rare for Laos. Secondly, architecture older than 50 years has been preserved here, which is even more rare. Thirdly, this is the least touristy of the cities (not villages) in the country; people mainly come here for a day to get a Thai visa at the consulate.

In this city (and in this house) Kaysone was born - the communist dictator of Laos, whose portrait is depicted on all banknotes.

I wanted to take a photo with the monument to him, as with Lenin, but there was no monument. There was only a monument to some other figure.

<p>
In general, the cult of personality in Laos is weakly expressed, and there are also fewer communist paraphernalia than in Vietnam and China. Only the pioneers wear red ties en masse.

The main French heritage is baguettes. They also exist in Laos. But sandwiches in Vietnam are much tastier, because in Laos they add some kind of liquor to them.

As usual, there are many temples, similar to Thai ones, but with more mini-stupas around the perimeter.

Savannakhet is located on the banks of the Mekong River. On the other side is the territory of Thailand (almost the entire border of the two countries runs along the Mekong). It is impossible to show the contrast between the two countries, because on the other side it is also not Manhattan, but Mukdahan.

Why do some places have beautiful sunsets and others not?
