<h2>Korolyov</h2>
<p>
I already showed Korolyov a little <a href="../moscow2015">in 2015</a>. This city has two central districts, near the Podlipki and Bolshevo stations (historically these were two different settlements). This time I went to Bolshevo mainly to drive a car and see something new. There is a rocket at the entrance to Korolyov.

There is also a monument to Lenin in this part of the city - near the military enterprise.

<h2>Shchyolkovo</h2>
<p>
The city of Shchyolkovo is located beyond Mytishchi and Korolev, it has a fairly large subordinate territory right up to the border with the Vladimir region. At the entrance there is a large cathedral with pointed domes.

The railway station has the gloomy name "Voronok" (<i>It's the colloquial name of the police car that carries prisoners</i>). I wouldn't want to go every day either in Voronok or from Voronok. There is also a Shchyolkovo station, but it is far from the center in the industrial zone.

<h2>Losino-Petrovsky</h2>
<p>
It is unlikely that you have heard about the city of Losino-Petrovsky, even if you live in Moscow. This is a small city with a population of about 25 thousand, located quite close to the Moscow Ring Road, but without a railway. The nearest Monino station in the village of the same name belongs to the territory of the city of Shchyolkovo; it takes about an hour to get to Monino, since the train goes in an arc.
<p/>

There is a military airfield and a military aviation museum in Monino, so there are many aviation-themed monuments.

<p>
The architecture of Monino consists mainly of ordinary panel houses, but this one stands out among them. At first I couldn’t understand why the date was 1351, then I realized that it was 1951.

After traveling a few kilometers by bus, I end up in Losino-Petrovsky. The city has such a strange name because it grew out of the Losin manufactory founded by Peter I. It became a city in Soviet times, and then it acquired its modern name (before that - Petrovskaya Podgorodnaya Sloboda).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256582288_55488f51c8_h.jpg"/>

<h2>Moscow</h2>
<p>
After a grand exploration of Moscow in the summer and autumn, with the onset of cold weather, I walked the streets less. Long trips in winter also didn’t work out for obvious reasons. Winter 2020-2021 turned out to be atypically cold for Moscow and quite boring.
