<h2>Korolyov</h2>
<p>
I already showed Korolyov a little <a href="http://goo.gl/sO1ivV">in 2015</a>. This city has two central districts, near the Podlipki and Bolshevo stations (historically these were two different settlements). This time I went to Bolshevo mainly to drive a car and see something new. There is a rocket at the entrance to Korolyov.

There is also a monument to Lenin in this part of the city - near the military enterprise.

<h2>Shchyolkovo</h2>

The city of Shchyolkovo is located beyond Mytishchi and Korolev, it has a fairly large subordinate territory right up to the border with the Vladimir region. At the entrance there is a large cathedral with pointed domes.

The railway station has the gloomy name "Voronok" (<i>It's the colloquial name of the police car that carries prisoners</i>). I wouldn't want to go every day either in Voronok or from Voronok. There is also a Shchyolkovo station, but it is far from the center in the industrial zone.

<h2>Losino-Petrovsky</h2>
<p>
It is unlikely that you have heard about the city of Losino-Petrovsky, even if you live in Moscow. This is a small city with a population of about 25 thousand, located quite close to the Moscow Ring Road, but without a railway. The nearest Monino station in the village of the same name belongs to the territory of the city of Shchyolkovo; it takes about an hour to get to Monino, since the train goes in an arc.

The architecture of Monino consists mainly of ordinary panel houses, but this one stands out among them. At first I couldn’t understand why the date was 1351, then I realized that it was 1951.

After traveling a few kilometers by bus, I end up in Losino-Petrovsky. The city has such a strange name because it grew out of the Losin manufactory founded by Peter I. It became a city in Soviet times, and then it acquired its modern name (before that - Petrovskaya Podgorodnaya Sloboda).

<h2>Moscow</h2>
<p>
After a grand exploration of Moscow in the summer and autumn, with the onset of cold weather, I walked the streets less. Long trips in winter also didn’t work out for obvious reasons. Winter 2020-2021 turned out to be atypically cold for Moscow and quite boring.

On the other bank is the village of Shlyuzy ("river locks") - a very unusual place. This is a closed village, where you can only get by with passes. There are few residents there, everyone knows each other, and they don’t lock the doors.

Actually the lock gateways. They are surrounded by a fence; access inside is through the guards. Theoretically, in winter you can cross the ice unnoticed in another place.
