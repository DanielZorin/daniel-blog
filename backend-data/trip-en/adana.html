<h1>Turkey: Adana, Tarsus, Mersin, Kızkalesi, Anamur</h1>
<i>21-23 November 2022</i>
<h2>Adana</h2>
<p>
I have been yearning to go to the city of Adana for a long time, ever since I tried Adana kebab. And from Beirut on the date I needed there were no flights to Antalya, but a direct one to Adana - I took it and decided to get from there by land, seeing interesting cities along the way. First of all, I went to dinner and ordered Adana kebab, it was, of course, excellent.

<p>
There is a metro in Adana, one line. At the turnstile you can pay with a contactless bank card.
<p/>

The metro line goes around the city center in an arc, passing above the ground.

And here is the main attraction of Adana - the Stone Bridge, built almost 2000 years ago.

Until 2007, the bridge was a car bridge!

<p>
There is also a central mosque here, which until recently was the largest in Turkey. In 2019, it was surpassed by the new Çamlıca Mosque in the Asian part of Istanbul.

<h2>Tarsus</h2>
<p>
The small city of Tarsus between Adana and Mersin boasts that it is the oldest city in Turkey with a history of more than 5,000 years.
<p/>

<p/>

<p>
The signature says the following. One day Ataturk arrived in Tarsus and was greeted by crowds of residents. Suddenly the woman threw herself at his feet and asked: “I want to sacrifice myself on the ground on which you walk!” Ataturk helped her get up and replied: “Dear! You deserve not to fall to the ground, but to hold it on your shoulders.”

<h2>Mersin</h2>
<p>
Mersin is a large city in the province of the same name, where relatively many long-stayer tourists live, due to the fact that it is near the sea. From Adana you can conveniently travel by train.

Bus station. First, I drove there for a long time by taxi to the farthest edge of the city, took a minibus to Silifke, and it went not to the highway, but back through the entire city center, and collected all the traffic jams along the way, of which there are many, since Mersin is very large.

<h2>Kızkalesi</h2>
<p>
I arrived in the town of Kızkalesi towards sunset. Initially I planned to spend the night in the larger Silifke, 20 km away, but it turned out that there are a lot of hotels in Kızkalesi, and in November they were all empty, I checked into the first large hotel near the beach for only 300 liras, from the window there was a gorgeous view of the beach.
<p/>

On the island is the Kızkalesi Castle (Maiden's Castle), after which the town is named. In summer you can get there by boat.

There are two natural attractions near Kızkalesi. The first is a cave, for some reason called the asthma cave.

There is also a castle on a hill here, which I didn’t have time to see in detail.

<h2>Anamur</h2>
<p>
If you go west from Silifke, the only more or less large city for many kilometers to Alanya will be Anamur. The coast here consists entirely of steep cliffs, however, there are also many such areas in Lycia.

The main attraction of Anamur is Mamure Castle on the seashore, 5 kilometers from the city center. The highway passes by it, so I just got off the intercity bus in front of the castle.

This is one of the largest fortresses I have seen in Turkey.

There is nothing inside except the mosque, but you can climb high up the walls and into the citadel.
