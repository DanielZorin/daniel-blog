<h1>Russia: Voskresensk, Bronnitsy, Ramenskoye, Zhukovsky</h1>
<i>4 August 2021</i>
<h2>Voskresensk</h2>
<p>
The city of Voskresensk is located about an hour and a half drive from Moscow in the direction of Ryazan. From the train you go out onto a bridge, from which you can see a huge waste heap in the distance.

This was all a residential part, and the center was on the other side of the railway. There is a bus station right there.

<h2>Bronnitsy</h2>
<p>
Bronnitsy is a city of central subordination in the Moscow region. A rare example of a city in Moscow Region where there is no railway (you need to take a minibus from the neighboring town of Ramenskoye, or directly from Moscow).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51502712971_883f7919ef_o.jpg">

The city is small, but has certain attractions. Here is a pond with a gazebo.

<h2>Ramenskoye</h2>
<p>
The city of Ramenskoye is quite close to Moscow; the journey is less than an hour by train. I arrived by bus from Bronnitsy and began my exploration immediately from the Lenin monument near the plant.

Formally, the village of Bykovo also belongs to the city of Ramenskoye, although between them stands the city of Zhukovsky, which is a separate administrative unit. In Bykovo you have to walk along the streets between two rows of blank fences.

<h2>Zhukovsky</h2>
<p>
I have already visited the city of Zhukovsky twice in transit - on the way to Zhukovsky airport and to the MAKS air show. But I decided to see the city itself, since it was on the way. The train station is called Otdykh/"Rest".

The station itself has a children's railway, quite functional (but it seems that it was closed then due to Covid).
