<h1>India: Bangalore, Hyderabad, Aurangabad, Vapi, Daman, Silvassa</h1>
<i>19-27 July 2017</i>
<h2>Bangalore</h2>
<p>
Bangalore is one of the richest and most civilized cities in India. The headquarters of IT companies are located here and Indian programmers are trained (the best of whom then often move to the USA).
<p/>

<p>
Surprisingly, not only the two and a half central squares are clean here - entire large areas look somehow un-Indian.
<p/>

<p>
Street signs are available.

<p>
There is a large park-botanical garden in Bangalore, the only European-style park I have discovered in India.

A highway filled with traffic runs right through this square.
<p/>

<p>
I noticed this car drive up the street and stop at the sidewalk. There were several tourists and a guide there, the guide quickly said something, the tourists took pictures of the palace from the window without getting out of the car, and left. This is how rich tourists apparently get to know India.

High-rise buildings and fashionable shopping centers are being built in the business center of Bangalore.

Bangalore is a relatively new city; there are no legendary temples here. I went to a small temple dedicated to the bull.

The metro in Bangalore has already been completed to a good condition, three lines are working.

<h2>Hyderabad</h2>
<p>
Hyderabad is the second “technological” city in India after Bangalore, but this is somehow not noticeable. I spent three whole days in Hyderabad and explored the city in some detail.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255470332_bfc80a2607_o.jpg">
<p>
At the central intersection there is an arched mosque with four minarets - Charminar.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257243110_5d599924e2_o.jpg">
<p>
Nearby is also the palace of the former sultans.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256399713_768e5c3cb4_o.jpg">
<p>
And, as usual, there is a huge market around.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256200491_e83d7086b8_o.jpg">
<p>
The market has almost completely engulfed a rather vast and once clearly luxurious area with numerous arches and palaces.

<p>
Near the center there is Imliban Park, notable for the fact that photography is strictly prohibited there. Yes, just in the park.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257800540_e31d739786_o.jpg">
<p>
Apparently, so that no one burns this?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256200541_039049d5c5_o.jpg">
<p>
I also found a park in a good area, where there is no market and a lot of buildings behind fences and offices like that.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257244380_b6af99dac8_o.jpg">
<p>
But this park also turned out to be extremely neglected - the water in the pond was covered with mud.
<p/>

Although, in theory, you can even ride a catamaran here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256201511_d1b2e9a496_o.jpg">
<p>
There are almost no benches in the park; rare visitors sit on the grass.
<p/>

But this is only from a distance.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257244145_dde9540068_o.jpg">
<p>
But the coolest thing is the intermediate fence after the entrance, open only 50 centimeters. And everyone passes through, but what to do?

In India, there is usually a bench near McDonald's, in the middle of which Ronald sits lounging.

The Hyderabad metro opened 4 months after I visited there. At the end of 2018, it is already the second longest metro system in India with two lines. In different places around the city I saw lines and stations under construction.

I traveled around the city by bus and a little by Uber taxi. The bus system is absolutely insane. In Russia there can be routes 125 and 125a, but in Hyderabad, it seems, they decided to use all the letters of the alphabet, sometimes even two at once.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255470232_4e2330d1b6_o.jpg">

However, Google maps somehow knows the routes.

The railway station is located in the neighboring city of Secunderabad; on the website you need to look for Secunderabad Junction, because the Hyderabad Deccan station is much smaller. By the way, there is also a large city called Hyderabad in Pakistan, Hyderabad Station is there. In Secunderabad, near the railway station, I stayed in a hotel.

Another attraction of Hyderabad is Hussain Sagar Lake. It is so popular that the entrance to the park by the lake is like an airport.

It seems to me that I have never seen a park so crowded with people just like that, without some kind of concert or festival.

On the outskirts of Hyderabad is the Golconda Fort, the residence of the former rulers of the region (the state was also called Hyderabad). These were once some of the richest people in the world because diamonds were mined in the vicinity of Hyderabad. Now the fort is abandoned, but its former greatness can be felt.

<h2>Ellora Caves</h2>
<p>
Ellora Caves are rock-cut Buddhist and Hindu temples from the 6th to 11th centuries, a World Heritage Site. Getting there is easy from the city of Aurangabad, about an hour by bus. Entrance, as usual, costs 500 rupees.

<h2>Khuldabad</h2>
<p>
5 kilometers from the Ellora Caves there is the city of Khuldabad. Aurangzeb, the sixth and last real emperor of the Mughal dynasty and the son of Shah Jahan, who built the Taj Mahal, is buried here. His mausoleum is several orders of magnitude more modest than his father’s.

<h2>Daulatabad</h2>
<p>
Between Khuldabad and Aurangabad lies the town of Daulatabad with a giant fort on a hill - well worth a visit if you're in the region.
<p/>

<p>
At the entrance you don’t realize the full scale of this place, because the peak is visible somewhere in the distance. When I got off the bus, it started to rain heavily, so I ate at a roadside canteen for about 30 minutes until the rain stopped. But the damp earth and stones gave the castle a particularly rich hue.

<h2>Aurangabad</h2>
<p>
When I said about the modest tomb of Emperor Aurangzeb, I was lying a little. After all, he (along with his son) built a replica of the Taj Mahal in Aurangabad after the death of his wife, just like his father built the Taj Mahal for his. This place is called Bibi ka Maqbara.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255849161_87e32a2e7b_o.jpg">

And the narrow roads are of appalling quality. In general, in India there are good new highways between major cities, but as soon as you enter any city, the quality of the roads drops to the very bottom, much worse than in Russia. Therefore, if you travel by bus, you will constantly alternate between fast sections and very slow  ones. But the road from Nashik to Vapi has not yet been completed to a good condition.

Somewhere here my bus collided with a truck, or rather, they were unable to pass each other carefully on the narrow road. All passengers got off the bus and waited for about 30 minutes until the accident was cleared up.

<h2>Vapi</h2>
<p>
I used this small town in Gujarat as a base for trips to Daman and Silvassa, because there is a railway there. Surprisingly, I was able to easily find an inexpensive hotel on the main street, which looked something like this:
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255689856_93271a3379_o.jpg">
<p>
It was this town that became for me  the typical image of India, probably because it is the only uninteresting provincial town without attractions, in which I not only walked for an hour during a transfer, but spent the night twice, and visited shops and restaurants.

By the way, everything is very bad with food. I walked around the city center for an hour and a half to find at least some place where I could eat not only vegetables, and in the end I found it, and had dinner there both days. There was also an Italian bakery next door.

<h2>Daman</h2>
<p>
Daman was the main purpose of my appearance in these lands. This was the same Portuguese colony as Goa, which passed to India only in the second half of the 20th century. It is now a separate administrative unit called Daman and Diu (Diu is another Portuguese city quite far from Daman, on the other side of the bay). Let's see what's preserved here.

Unlike the northern fort, here you can climb the wall only in certain places. One of them is located in a remote corner and is densely overgrown.

<h2>Silvassa</h2>
<p>
The Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli is another remnant of the Portuguese colonies in India. Unlike Daman and Goa, which were held for more than 10 years, this piece was lost by Portugal a little earlier. The fact is that there is no connection with this territory by sea - it is slightly inland. From 1954 to 1961, after the overthrow of the colonial administration, this territory was formally independent! Although in reality, of course, it was completely dependent on India. Initially, such a piece of land detached from the sea came to the Portuguese because the Maratha Empire in the 18th century gave them the right to collect taxes from 70 villages in the area under a peace treaty, and after the collapse of this empire, the lands went to Portugal in their entirety. Dadra and Nagar Haveli were administered from Daman. The territory consists of the small enclave village of Dadra and a larger piece to the south, with the largest city of Silvassa.

Silvassa was a small town without much strategic importance, so there is little left of Portugal here, not like in Goa. Few people came here from Europe to live. This is what the main cathedral of Silvassa looks like:

And then suddenly, in this hole, they are building a kind of multi-story microdistrict.

There'll be more. It seems like Dadra and Nagar Haveli have lower taxes, so people from all over the country are moving here.
