<h1>South Ossetia</h1>
<i>11 May 2014</i>
<p>
Like the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, the war between Georgia and Ossetia is a continuation of a similar war that took place after the first collapse of Russia in 1917. The scheme is well known from <a href="../vukovar">Yugoslavia</a>: Georgia leaves the USSR, and Ossetia, by analogy, leaves Georgia. Abkhazia, according to Georgian laws, is still an autonomy, but South Ossetia was completely disbanded on paper, and the territory was distributed among neighboring regions. Until 2008, South Ossetia was the Caucasian analogue of Kosovo: the territory was under the control of Russian peacekeepers, and the country lived off the smuggling trade; Tskhinvali had the largest black market in Transcaucasia. After the 2008 war, the border with Georgia was tightly closed, the factories that were still operating also closed, and now the country lives on Russian subsidies. The only connection with the outside world is the Roki tunnel, and it somewhat reduces the potential competitiveness of Ossetian goods. Only fruits and mineral water are exported to Russia. The vast majority of residents of South Ossetia also have Russian citizenship.

The Roki tunnel was being repaired; cars were allowed through only in one direction, which changed every half hour. We left the tunnel just at the end of the period, so we had to wait about 30 minutes for the next car towards Tskhinvali, this time was enough to go down into the valley closer to the inscription “Thank you, Russia!” There are no South Ossetian border guards on this side of the tunnel at all. At least, I was checked both at the exit and at the entrance only from the Russian side, and the people in uniform standing on the Ossetian side did not pay the slightest attention, although we wandered along the highway near the border for about 10 minutes.

For some reason the valley is terribly littered. Tires are dumped here.

The most popular party is unsurprisingly called “United Ossetia” and advocates the annexation of South Ossetia to Russia.

We are going to Tskhinvali.
<p/>

<p>
Not far from the border there are springs with mineral water, which seems to be exported abroad.

The landscapes are excellent, similar to <a href="../armenia">Armenia</a>.

At the entrance to Tskhinvali you can see the ruins of houses, many completely razed to the ground. This is what they do with villages where there was a Georgian population before the 2008 war. Houses are destroyed so that the owners have nowhere to return (compare with the situation in <a href="../northern-cyprus">Northern Cyprus</a>, where 40 years after the conflict the main issue is the return of the lost houses to the Greeks).
<p/>

<p>
A rare inscription in Georgian has been preserved.

<p>
So, Tskhinvali. The first thing you need to do is shop around. First - souvenirs.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257877310_e255b5b5c2_o.jpg">
<p>
Then you can buy a PS-2 console. They say there are even games for it, unlike the PS-3!
<p/>

<p>
If anything, you can always copy games from VHS.
<p/>

<p>
The next point of the shopping tour is homemade beer.
<p/>

<p>
“Tskhinval” T-shirts go well with it.
<p/>

<p>
Finally, you can look into the solarium (prices are higher than in Moscow) and the Vintage store, where everything costs 100 rubles.
<p/>

<p>
And buy churchkhela (the only thing that unites South Ossetia with Georgia) at the local farmers' market.
<p/>

<p>
Oh yes, there is also a building materials store on Yuri Luzhkov Street.
<p/>

<p>
Since we are talking about streets, there is Stalin Street. In general, people in Ossetia love Stalin very much, because they believe that he was not a Georgian, but an Ossetian.

Here is the main attraction of Tskhinval - the intersection of Putin Street and Medvedev Street.
<p/>

This is in a new microdistrict on the outskirts of the city.

What also struck me in Tskhinvali was the quality of the roads. I have never seen such bad roads anywhere before. Yes, it happens that there is no road at all, that is, you simply drive on land on which there is no grass, this is a common thing in Russian and other provinces. But here there seems to be a road, but it consists of a pile of small stones, which are usually placed deep under the asphalt.

<p>
And most importantly, this is not an isolated case, it’s like this everywhere!

Some more remains of asphalt are visible here.

Only the main street is properly paved.

Tskhinvali is also of interest to fans of military tourism.
<p/>

There are a lot of houses with traces of bullets and shells left here.

On the wall you can see the inscription “He who is not with us is below us.”

The return trip to Vladikavkaz was interesting. First, we were picked up near Tskhinvali by a Russian army officer, he invited us to see his unit in the village of Dzau (in the center of South Ossetia) and treated us to a soldier’s lunch.

<p>
Then we took pictures with monuments to Lenin and Stalin, met a local resident who restored the monument to Stalin.

And then toured the residence where serious Russian officials hold meetings.
