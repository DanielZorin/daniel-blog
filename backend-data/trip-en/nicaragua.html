<h1>Nicaragua: Leon, Matagalpa, Managua, Masaya, Granada, Rivas</h1>
<i>27-30 October 2021</i>
<h2>Leon</h2>
<p>
The first acquaintance with Nicaragua was not very successful. It started with the fact that I sat at the border for three and a half hours - it was the worst border after <a href="../uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a> (where I spent 5 hours). The border guards decided to test me with a complete list of questions for travelers; they carefully wrote down how much money I had, which countries I entered on what day, and the address of my hotel. When the chief border guard finally approved me, even stamping took about 10 minutes - while they filled out and stamped a dozen pieces of paper in different copies. I went through the gate, where the customs officers stopped me - it turned out that EVERYONE needs to fill out a customs declaration, and to get it, you have to go back to the bridge, where the man sits and hands them out, then to the room with the customs officers, where they will stamp it. Whoops, another kilometer or two of walking in the terrible heat, and I’m in Nicaragua.

<p>
After the border, I was unable to buy a SIM card or change money. Luckily, on the Honduran side I had already exchanged the rest of my Honduran money for Nicaraguan Cordobas, which meant I had $10 to get to Leon. One cramped minibus and I'm in the city of Chinandega. Immediately changed to another one to Leon.
<p/>

<p>
I compared Honduras with the Philippines and expected that Nicaragua would be something like Vietnam, but when I got off the minibus at the market-bus station of Leon, I saw something more like Bangladesh or India. This is clearly the poorest country in Central America, since it is the only place where you can see pedicabs.

<p>
It was very dirty around until I reached the historical center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51736371664_198b296d20_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Then life began to get better: I checked into a hotel, bought a SIM card there, then with great difficulty, but was still able to withdraw money from an ATM and have dinner.
<p/>

<p>
In the center everything was decent and did not feel dangerous, at least there were a lot of people in the square, which usually does not happen in dangerous countries. Nicaragua has a crime rate much lower than Honduras and El Salvador.

“Bush is a genocidalist and enemy of humanity” is written on the wall; clearly the building in the central square has not been painted since at least 2008.

A little later they wrote “Daniel for President 2012-2017.” My namesake is the President of Nicaragua, who has been in power for many years.

<h2>Matagalpa</h2>
<p>
Matagalpa is a small town in the mountains with a cool climate. In Southeast Asia, I loved visiting such places; I wanted to see an analogue in Central America.

<p>
The minibuses in Nicaragua are fun. I have never seen folding seats like this placed in the aisle so that there is no wasted space.
<p/>

The town looks something like this.

Once you descend from the heights into the southern part of Nicaragua, the landscape turns into a plain, something I did not experience in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.

<h2>Managua</h2>
<p>
The capital of Nicaragua was destroyed by an earthquake in 1972. And in 1979, the Sandinista revolution occurred. It overthrew the dictator Somoza (about whom the US President said the catchphrase that he was “our son of a bitch”), after that Nicaragua began to focus on the USSR and build socialism. That is why this country is so different from its neighbors, where there is anarcho-capitalism and the power of mafia gangs. There is socialism in Nicaragua, which means there is only one gang - the state. There is no crime, but for protection from the state you have to pay, as usual, a price higher than for protection from bandits - as a result, the standard of living in Nicaragua is the lowest in the region (and prices too, which is a plus for tourists). Neighboring Costa Rica, not the richest country, even introduced visas for Nicaraguans, due to the fact that the flow of refugees had become very large. A few years ago, pension reform was carried out in Nicaragua, protest rallies were cracked on, and the dissatisfaction of the dissatisfied and the flight from the country accelerated, in general, the picture is familiar to us. In urban planning, Nicaragua apparently also decided to take inspiration from the USSR; as a result, wide empty avenues appeared in the capital.

<p>
The earthquake destroyed the historical center, but the outskirts look like the rest of the cities of Nicaragua. This is the bus station:

<p>
From the hotel I immediately went to the central square. The President's office on three sides:
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51735723571_9a08c6e476_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Parliament and a monument to Sandino, a revolutionary of the 1930s who died in the fight against the junta.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51734897797_1ac1278b23_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The cathedral was damaged by an earthquake, so you can't go into it.

On the fourth side there is a monument. When I photographed it, the KGB officer came up to me and said that it was forbidden to photograph.

<p>
At some point, I realized that I had been walking along the same street for half an hour and photographing mostly trees, because there was nothing else.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51734897387_ef94b637de_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I decided to turn sideways and see how it was.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51735957183_7605c52f9e_h.jpg"/>

<p>
A picture about the friendship between Nicaragua and Russia. Nicaragua recognizes the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia! It is not particularly clear what other cooperation there is.
<p/>

By the way, the slogan is popular here: “Nicaragua is Christian, socialist and solidary.”
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51736368419_ce4d6ebf7c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Also in Nicaragua, they honor Chavez (the former president of Venezuela, who brought a country with tons of oil to famine). There is such a monument in the center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51736367629_98af282aa2_h.jpg"/>

Monument near the military base. I took the photo from the side so the guards wouldn’t get to the bottom of it.
<p/>

Monument to the knot.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51735722856_dbedf20a43_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the center there is a park with a volcanic lake. The entrance to it, as it turned out, is only from the side where the military base is, but from the other side you can at least see the panorama. At the top there is a monument to Sandino.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51734896937_22aef035c5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This part of the park is being destroyed.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51734896857_9a5a631201_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In general, the parks and walking areas in the center of Managua are in disrepair, I felt uncomfortable walking there - if this were the case in Brazil, definitely no one would go for a walk here because of the risk of robbery.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51736610290_06c0662472_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Instead of the destroyed cathedral, a new one was built in the brutalist style.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51734896672_7866a17015_h.jpg"/>
<p>
According to Soviet tradition, it was surrounded by a huge perimeter kilometer by kilometer fence, and the entrance was made only on one side, not the one where I was. All around there are weeds and desolation.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51736367284_d6014506fe_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Surprisingly, Nicaragua also has such signs of globalization as shopping malls and McDonald's. Around the shopping center there is typical chaos with stalls and minibuses, but inside it is quiet and calm.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51736610085_d11c3217ae_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Masaya</h2>
<p>
Near Managua there is Masaya Volcano - one of the most easily accessible active volcanoes in the world, which is even easier to get to than <a href="../sulawesi">Bromo</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51736366744_722222cf7c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The volcano is located right next to the main highway passing through all the main cities of Central America (Pan American), about 15 minutes drive from Managua.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51735722466_d57f663f6c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Right next to the highway there is a ticket office where you can buy not only a ticket, but also a minibus transfer to the very top, and it costs pennies - about 5 dollars in total. The bus takes you to the top.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51734896217_91129db97a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Along the way you can see a couple of buildings destroyed by the eruption.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51736609775_183b2a5689_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And here is the top. A few years ago, as I understand it, the smoke was stronger - in "Heads and Tails" show they said that you should not stand at the edge for more than 5 minutes.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51736609695_f54ff1673b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Before you could even see a lava lake, especially at night, but now I couldn’t see anything.
<p/>

Yes, on a horse.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51736609490_47d19c33a6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is an old crater here, from a long-ago eruption, which has already become overgrown.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51734895912_98d1017333_h.jpg"/>
<p>

There was nothing particularly interesting there, so I just changed from one bus to another, buying water.

The bus station, as usual, is at the market, buses barely squeeze between the rows of vegetable stalls.

<p>
It’s interesting that the buses have a schedule - it’s written under the roof. This is apparently the schedule of this particular bus, because in general buses from Managua to Masaya go every 10-15 minutes.

<h2>Granada</h2>
<p>
Perhaps the most beautiful colonial city in Central America is Granada (and there is also Granada <a href="../sevilla">in Spain</a>). By the way, it is the oldest in this region (not counting Panama City, which was destroyed and built in a new place) and the second after <a href="../dominicana">Santo Domingo</a>. This is the only large city where you can feel a relaxed atmosphere, that people are chilling here, going to a cafe in the evening, and not hiding from bandits. It is not clear why Granada is not included in the World Heritage List; the entire center appears to be well preserved.

For some reason, the city does not stretch along the lake, as one might expect, but exactly perpendicularly.

<h2>Rivas</h2>
<p>
Before going to Costa Rica, I decided to take a quick look at Lake Nicaragua, which gave the country its name. It is the largest lake in the region, connected through a river to the Caribbean Sea, making Granada a port on the Atlantic Ocean. There have been ideas in the past to build an alternative to the Panama Canal through Nicaragua, since only a fairly narrow strip needs to be dug between the lake and the Pacific Ocean. The last time the Chinese thought about this was in the 2010s, but abandoned the idea.
<p/>

<p>
The nearest town is called Rivas. There, as usual, there is a cathedral in the central square.

The ferries regularly go to Ometepe Island in the middle of the lake. It is very reminiscent of <a href="../sumatra">Lake Toba in Indonesia</a> - also a volcanic lake with an island, and popular with tourists.

On the horizon in the haze you can see two volcanoes, which make up the island, shaped like two intersecting circles (like <a href="../tahiti">Tahiti</a>)
