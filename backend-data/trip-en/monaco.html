<h1>Monaco</h1>
<i>12 March 2014</i>
<p>
Monaco is strikingly different from other European microstates (such as <a href="../andorra">Andorra</a>, <a href="../liechtenstein">Liechtenstein</a>, <a href="../luxembourg">Luxembourg</a>, <a href="../vatican">Vatican</a> or <a href="../san-marino">San Marino</a>). This is a fragment of old feudal Europe, but not lost somewhere far away, but instead located on the prestigious Cote d'Azur. The most expensive and prestigious real estate is here, and visually Monaco is most similar to <a href="../hong-kong">Hong Kong</a>.

Monaco's area is much smaller than even Andorra's, so millionaires are forced to live here in tall apartment buildings, just like on the outskirts of Moscow. Private villas are for billionaires.

The state of Monaco consists of four cities adjacent to each other: Monaco, Monte Carlo, La Condamine and Fontveille. Only Monaco is still an old European city, the rest are being built up.

From these balconies you probably have a good view of the Formula 1 races that take place on the streets of Monte Carlo.

The border between Monaco and France is not guarded; it runs right through the streets. The houses on the upper levels of the hills are in France.

Here is the Bay of Monaco, where the yachts of Abramovich and other rich people visited.

Fontvielle, apparently, is the least prestigious area.

Monaco is a country that was polished to the maximum.

You won't find a single piece of trash on the streets here. Here they even went so far as to put signs for defibrillators.

Who might need to write a letter inside Monaco? It takes an hour to walk from one end of the country to the other.

At this time, the leaves are already processed in a special machine.

10 euros for a refrigerator magnet is an absolute record, and by a wide margin! Switzerland can feel ashamed. You don’t even have to try to go to restaurants.

Why does the Niger Republic need a consulate in Monaco? Probably a considerable percentage of the budget is spent on its maintenance. I guess the dictator of Niger has a villa here.

Of all the micro states, Monaco takes the least time to explore. The Vatican, although smaller, includes many extensive museums, and here you can walk across the entire country in all directions in about three hours.
