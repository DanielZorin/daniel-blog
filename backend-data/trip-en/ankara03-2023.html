<h1>Turkey: Ankara</h1>
<i>6, 16-17 March 2023</i>
<h2>Ankara</h2>
<p>
I flew to the UAE via Ankara, and since there were no convenient connections, both times I spent the night in the city and had time to take a walk. I liked Ankara since last time, it was interesting to see what has changed in a year and three months.

The weather was great, although chilly.

There are still half-built houses on the hills.

<p>
The area inside the castle walls has changed a lot. Most of the old buildings <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/711169.html">that I wrote about</a>, as I assumed, were demolished, replaced by new ones in the Ottoman style. Judging by the appearance, some of the new buildings are already occupied.

On the second day I walked around the museums in the center of Ankara. The most popular museum here is archaeological (Museum of Anatolian Civilizations).

It contains exhibits related to the most ancient states in Turkey, mainly those that existed before the Roman Empire.

In particular, there are many items from the two most famous ancient sites of central Turkey - Çatalhöyük (near Konya) and Hattuşa (near Ankara), which are quite difficult to get to.

The second Ankara Museum is the historical building of the National Assembly of Turkey, where the republic was proclaimed. Groups of children are taken there one after another.

The elegant building houses an art museum - not such a common occurrence in Turkey (there is none in Antalya, for example).

Painting in Turkey appeared quite late, during the era of Tanzimat modernization (1840-1860s), when imitation of Western Europe became popular (at the same time they began to build palaces like Dolmabahce in Istanbul).
<p/>

<p>
You can easily discern different influences in the paintings of Turkish artists.

For example, Nurullah Berk starts with a still life, then something similar to Picasso.

And then it turns out something in the spirit of Malevich and Kandinsky.

On the main staircase hangs a painting by Russian artist Vasily Vereshchagin (Tomb of Tamerlane). It is not known exactly how it ended up here. Presumably, it was given to Ataturk by the Bolsheviks in the 1920s.

During the flight to the east, the sky was very clear for part of the journey, and one could see the landscapes of eastern Turkey. There was still a lot of snow there.

The plane did not fly to the UAE in a straight line, it bypassed not only Syria, but even Iraq, making a long detour over the territory of Iran. This is Lake Urmia near <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/731179.html">Tabriz</a>.
