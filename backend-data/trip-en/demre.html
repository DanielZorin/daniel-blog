<h1>Turkey: Demre</h1>
<i>28 June 2022</i>
<h2>Demre</h2>
<p>
I went on a tour to Demre by bus; probably for the first time since childhood, I was on a Russian-language tour. I did this because otherwise it was completely unclear how to get on a boat near the island of Kekova, it seems that all the boats there only serve groups of tourists.

<p>
The first stop was at a gas station between Kumluca and Finike.

<p>
Around Kumluca there are many fields with greenhouses where tomatoes and peppers are grown.

In the city, the guide first took everyone to a store where they sell icons. During this time I managed to walk around the surrounding area.

The street is named after the Russian ambassador who was killed by a terrorist several years ago.

The main attraction of the center of Demre is the Church of St. Nicholas (8th century). Entrance there is not included in the price of the excursion, but I went in for free with a museum membership.

Saint Nicholas lived in this city, and was buried here (later the relics were transferred to <a href="../naples">Bari</a>).

The inscription in Russian on the lid was made in the mid-19th century.

In the Catholic tradition, Saint Nicholas became the prototype of Santa Claus.

After lunch (a simple buffet, the restaurant was apparently designed specifically for serving tourist groups, since the tables were in long rows, and not individual), we went to the ruins of the ancient city of Myra, on the site of which Demre stands. It’s about two kilometers from the center; if I had come on my own, I would have walked there.

<p>
The Lycian tombs are located here in a cluster, so all advertising posters show this particular view.

If you look closely, you can see bas-reliefs here and there.

Immediately at the exit from Myra, farms with greenhouses begin.

Next we were taken to a jewelry store. The store also clearly works for tourist groups, since there were several of them there at once, and it is located far from the city center and not even on the main road, but in some outlying areas.

<p>
Onyx goods. The tour guide referred to these stores as “sponsors,” apparently implying that their commissions allowed them to keep the base price of the tour quite low (it costs $25). It seems that if you buy an excursion through the hotel, it will be more expensive.

Finally, the last item on the program is a boat trip.

The places are beautiful, like everywhere else in the Antalya province.

From the ship you can see the ruins of the ancient Lycian city of Kekova on the shore.

Opposite the island of Kekova there is the town of Kaleüçağız, apparently if you go by public transport or by car, you need to go there and look for a boat to rent.
