<h2>Constanța</h2>
<p>
Seven years since <a href="../romania">last trip to Romania</a> I wanted to come to this magical country again, but everything was somehow postponed. A good trip is like wine - it must mature, apparently. So now next time is in a few more years. This was the second time I entered with adventures. In 2014, I had to hitch a ride to cross a bridge at the border and then take a taxi to Bucharest. Here it turned out even more fun - the bus from Varna to Constanta stupidly didn’t come (or departed much earlier, so I didn’t see it). What to do, I had to take a taxi to the border (65 euros). There was a huge line of cars and buses (tourist, not regular) at the border; it was nice to walk past them straight to the border guards’ window.

The nearest railway station from where you can leave is 10 kilometers away (Mangalia), and it's 40 kilometers to the big city of Constanța.

Constanța is the main Romanian port. The same sign in the shape of a ship stands at the entrance to the highway.

<h2>Bucharest</h2>
<p>
I was already in Bucharest <a href="../romania">in 2014</a>, then I managed to see quite a lot. This time I was mostly in the same places. Bucharest is: a small old city, many palaces with facades like in Paris, and Soviet avenues and high-rise buildings from the Ceausescu era.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51502711856_f1a480d742_h.jpg"/>

Among them are two special ones, operating since the 19th century. That time I was only in this one - Caru cu Bere ("Beer Car").

<p>
A signature dish at Manuca. Eating at both historic restaurants is inexpensive. Lunch costs 25 lei (5 euros). For dinner, the same dishes must be taken separately, but even there it is difficult to spend more than 10 euros per person.

<h2>Sibiu</h2>
<p>
From Bucharest to Sibiu it is approximately 5-6 hours by bus or train. Arriving at the station, I was surprised to find that there were no tickets for the train, because there were no seats - I had never encountered this before in Europe, usually all the trains run half empty. I had to rush to the bus station and take a bus (more precisely, a minibus). The bus route is different - if the train goes first north through Brasov and then west, the bus takes a more direct route through the city of Ramnicu Valcea, and then climbs into the mountains along the Olt River valley. These are very beautiful places - the old Făgăraș highway. Under Ceausescu, a parallel Transfăgărașan road was built several tens of kilometers to the east. Now that road is considered one of the most beautiful in Europe, but this one is also good.

In German, Transylvania is called "Siebenbürgen", that is, "Seven Cities". These are already known to me: Sibiu, Braşov, Sighişoara, as well as Sebeş, Bistrita, Cluj-Napoca and Mediaş, the last of which I came to.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51501909257_a0d472ff38_h.jpg"/>

Mediaş is a rather small city - 45 thousand population, but the historical center is sizeable.

<h2>Alba Iulia</h2>
<p>
Alba Iulia is a walled city in Transylvania where you can see 18th-century star-shaped fortifications, with bastions and ravelins. In this it is similar to the Portuguese city of <a href="../lisboa">Elvas</a>
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51503642435_74e68df514_h.jpg"/>

The first thing you encounter near the bus station is a cemetery. Romanian cemeteries are similar to others in Europe, with massive slabs, stone crosses and crypts.

The city center just begins across the road. It is not so easy to enter it - it is not for nothing that it is a fortress. There are two main entrances through the gate and one on the side, where you need to sneak through the narrow corridors between the fortifications.

You can go up to the bell tower, and it turns out that for some reason the windows on the top floor were covered with bars and mesh, so the photographs look something like this.

Near Deva in the city of Hunedoara there is one of the three most famous castles in Romania - the Corvin Castle.

At first it’s even hard to believe that this is a real castle, and not the main building of Disneyland.

The castle belonged to the Hungarian Hunyadi family. The famous Vajdahunyad Castle in <a href="../hungary">Budapest</a> was built for the Hungarian millennium and included elements of various famous Hungarian buildings, but was mainly inspired by this castle.

Arad is a relatively large city (population 150 thousand), where there was a long transfer. The station here is quite respectable.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51502941373_4922bf529a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It reminded me of the train station in Czech <a href="../prague">Pilsen</a>, there are also cool bas-reliefs inside with workers from the late 19th century. It was one country back then - Austria-Hungary.

<h2>Timişoara</h2>
<p>
Timişoara is the third largest city in Romania, located near the borders with Hungary and Serbia. I didn't expect much from this city, but it pleasantly surprised me.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51501904587_c964efb8c1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Timişoara is called "little <a href="../vienna">Vienna</a>" (by analogy with Bucharest - little Paris), but I would rather compare it with <a href="../szeged">Budapest</a> or on some streets even with St. Petersburg.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51503419829_d8846d8727_h.jpg"/>

A little further is a nondescript train station. The ride to Bucharest is quite far - 8-9 hours. You can fly by plane, but the schedule is simply terrible - departures are at 5 am and shortly before midnight, normal departure times are only for a very expensive airline. But it’s close to Budapest and Belgrade - about three hours, although flying from Budapest to Russia costs like buying your own plane, and to enter Serbia you need a PCR test.

Excellent dish "Tochitura Moldoveneasca". The tochitura has fatty meat and sausage on top, but I was more impressed with the side dish. This is a piece of mamaliga - a Romanian dense porridge made from corn flour, sprinkled with feta cheese and covered with an omelette.

<h2>Drobeta-Turnu Severin</h2>
<p>
Romania's southern border with Serbia and Bulgaria runs for quite a long time along the banks of the great Danube River. The last time I came from Bulgaria was on the bridge over the Danube between Ruse and Giurgiu, but there is another bridge connecting Romania with Serbia, further to the west. There the Danube passes through a picturesque gorge, and you can also take a train there on the way from Timişoara to Bucharest.

<p>
The nearest large town, about 20 kilometers downstream, is called Drobeta-Turnu Severin. Why such a strange long name? The city was founded during the times of ancient Rome and was named Drobeta, there was even a bridge over the Danube, which collapsed in the Middle Ages. Then, on the site of Drobeta, they founded a new settlement, which was called the “Northern Tower”, or maybe the “Tower of Septimius Severus” (Roman Emperor). Then the two names were combined.
