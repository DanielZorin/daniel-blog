<h2>Constanța</h2>
<p>
Seven years since <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/tag/romania">last trip to Romania</a> I wanted to come to this magical country again, but everything was somehow postponed. A good trip is like wine - it must mature, apparently. So now next time is in a few more years. This was the second time I entered with adventures. In 2014, I had to hitch a ride to cross a bridge at the border and then take a taxi to Bucharest. Here it turned out even more fun - the bus from Varna to Constanta stupidly didn’t come (or departed much earlier, so I didn’t see it). What to do, I had to take a taxi to the border (65 euros). There was a huge line of cars and buses (tourist, not regular) at the border; it was nice to walk past them straight to the border guards’ window.

The nearest railway station from where you can leave is 10 kilometers away (Mangalia), and it's 40 kilometers to the big city of Constanța.

Constanța is the main Romanian port. The same sign in the shape of a ship stands at the entrance to the highway.

<h2>Bucharest</h2>
<p>
I was already in Bucharest <a href="../romania">in 2014</a>, then I managed to see quite a lot. This time I was mostly in the same places. Bucharest is: a small old city, many palaces with facades like in Paris, and Soviet avenues and high-rise buildings from the Ceausescu era.

A signature dish at Manuca. Eating at both historic restaurants is inexpensive. Lunch costs 25 lei (5 euros). For dinner, the same dishes must be taken separately, but even there it is difficult to spend more than 10 euros per person.

<h2>Sibiu</h2>
<p>
From Bucharest to Sibiu it is approximately 5-6 hours by bus or train. Arriving at the station, I was surprised to find that there were no tickets for the train, because there were no seats - I had never encountered this before in Europe, usually all the trains run half empty. I had to rush to the bus station and take a bus (more precisely, a minibus). The bus route is different - if the train goes first north through Brasov and then west, the bus takes a more direct route through the city of Ramnicu Valcea, and then climbs into the mountains along the Olt River valley. These are very beautiful places - the old Făgăraș highway. Under Ceausescu, a parallel Transfăgărașan road was built several tens of kilometers to the east. Now that road is considered one of the most beautiful in Europe, but this one is also good.

In German, Transylvania is called "Siebenbürgen", that is, "Seven Cities". These are already known to me: Sibiu, Braşov, Sighişoara, as well as Sebeş, Bistrita, Cluj-Napoca and Mediaş, the last of which I came to.

<h2>Alba Iulia</h2>
<p>
Alba Iulia is a walled city in Transylvania where you can see 18th-century star-shaped fortifications, with bastions and ravelins. In this it is similar to the Portuguese city of <a href="../lisboa">Elvas</a>

The city center just begins across the road. It is not so easy to enter it - it is not for nothing that it is a fortress. There are two main entrances through the gate and one on the side, where you need to sneak through the narrow corridors between the fortifications.

<h2>Timişoara</h2>
<p>
Timişoara is the third largest city in Romania, located near the borders with Hungary and Serbia. I didn't expect much from this city, but it pleasantly surprised me.

Timişoara is called "little <a href="../vienna">Vienna</a>" (by analogy with Bucharest - little Paris), but I would rather compare it with <a href="../szeged">Budapest</a> or on some streets even with St. Petersburg.
<p/>

A little further is a nondescript train station. The ride to Bucharest is quite far - 8-9 hours. You can fly by plane, but the schedule is simply terrible - departures are at 5 am and shortly before midnight, normal departure times are only for a very expensive airline. But it’s close to Budapest and Belgrade - about three hours, although flying from Budapest to Russia costs like buying your own plane, and to enter Serbia you need a PCR test.

<h2>Drobeta-Turnu Severin</h2>

Romania's southern border with Serbia and Bulgaria runs for quite a long time along the banks of the great Danube River. The last time I came from Bulgaria was on the bridge over the Danube between Ruse and Giurgiu, but there is another bridge connecting Romania with Serbia, further to the west. There the Danube passes through a picturesque gorge, and you can also take a train there on the way from Timişoara to Bucharest.

The nearest large town, about 20 kilometers downstream, is called Drobeta-Turnu Severin. Why such a strange long name? The city was founded during the times of ancient Rome and was named Drobeta, there was even a bridge over the Danube, which collapsed in the Middle Ages. Then, on the site of Drobeta, they founded a new settlement, which was called the “Northern Tower”, or maybe the “Tower of Septimius Severus” (Roman Emperor). Then the two names were combined.
