<h1>Guernsey</h1>
<i>21 August 2019</i>
<p>
There are three territories around Great Britain that have the status of “Crown dependencies” - they are not colonies, but not a full-fledged part of the United Kingdom etiher. Residents have full British citizenship (unlike the Overseas Territories, whose residents have separate passports), but labor migration from Britain to the islands is limited and separate customs rules apply. The islands of Guernsey and Jersey are located off the northern coast of France. Guernsey also administratively includes the neighboring small islands of Alderney, Sark and Herm.

We approach Guernsey, numerous fortifications are visible along the coast.

The most populated part of Guernsey is the east coast.

I left the airport and took the first bus, buying a full day ticket for £5 (one trip costs £1). Guernsey has a good network of buses, but the most important ones are the two buses that circle the island, one clockwise and the other anti-clockwise. I went clockwise the whole time, and the first point I got to was Plainmont.

<p>
This is the most southwestern point of the island.

On the cape stands the Pezeries fort, dating back to the 18th century, abandoned in the 19th.

The next stop was near the village of Vazon, in the middle of the west coast.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256352188_a17d837642_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here on the shore there is a round watchtower - the British built 15 of them along the perimeter of the island at the end of the 18th century to protect against revolutionary France.

Now it just stands empty and locked.

<p>
Car license plates in Guernsey have the simplest possible design - five digits and that's it. There are also cars with standard British license plates, European Union format - apparently those who came from the mainland or sometimes go there by ferry.

It was completed in the 20th century. The Germans did this during the Second World War - Guernsey and neighboring Jersey were the only British territories that came under occupation.

Next stop is the town of Saint Sampson, on the northeastern edge of the island. This place looks like a full-fledged small town.

Welcome to Saint-Pierre-Port. Inscriptions in Guernsey are duplicated in the Guernsey dialect of the Norman language - it looks similar to French, but the spelling is phonetic.
