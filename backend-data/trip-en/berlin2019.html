<h1>Germany: Berlin</h1>
<i>3 September 2019</i>
<h2>Berlin</h2>
<p>
It was a very short visit to Berlin: to get from Manchester to Moscow without returning to London, I flew Ryanair to Berlin, and from there Pobeda home. In the process, I had to cross the whole of Berlin to get from Schönefeld Airport to Tegel Airport.

I changed from train to bus near Berlin Central Station, which I had not studied carefully last time.

The Bundestag dome is visible in the distance.

I bought some nice foods at a nearby store.
