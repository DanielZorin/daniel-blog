<h1>Greece: Heraklion, Rethymno, Santorini, Delphi, Larissa, Thessaloniki</h1>
<i>19-25 July 2018</i>
<h2>Heraklion</h2>
<p>
I designed the itinerary for my second trip to Greece so that it did not intersect with the itinerary of the first. Then I traveled from west to east, and this time - from south to north. The first point was the island of Crete - the largest of the Greek islands in the Aegean Sea.

I rented an entire studio apartment in the city of Heraklion, the capital of Crete. Even though I was there in July, at the height of the holiday season, the apartment cost about 40 euros. Most tourists in Crete live in hotel villages near the beaches. Most of Heraklion looks something like this:

In the very center there is one street with souvenir (and other) shops.

Crete, like Corfu, was long under Venetian rule, but eventually passed to Turkey in the 17th century. In 1898, it still managed to separate, and in 1908 it became part of Greece.

At the other end of the main street there are external fortifications, quite solid - apparently the Turks took the matter seriously.

Greek salad. This is one of my favorite dishes to make at home because it's so quick to make. It’s interesting that in Greece they don’t bother much with cutting: the tomatoes were cut into very large pieces, and the cheese was generally cut into one slice.

<h2>Rethymno</h2>
<p>
In terms of attractions in Crete, there are not that many options where to go. There is a beautiful gorge on the far western edge of the island, but getting to it is long and difficult. Beaches and large cities remain: Heraklion, Rethymno, Chania and Agios Nikolaos. I went west to Rethymno, then at the station I decided where to go next - back to Heraklion or first to Chania, and then back, and this time, which is very unusual, laziness won. In Rethymno, the city center is best preserved.

<h2>Santorini</h2>
<p>
The most beautiful and unusual Greek island is, of course, Santorini (aka Thira). All the islands in the Aegean Sea are normal islands, and this is the top of an ancient volcano. I went to Santorini one day from Crete, and this was not enough - I barely had time to see the main attractions, and did not have time to get to the southern half of the island. So it’s better to fork out for expensive accommodation and come to the island for an overnight stay.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254711737_b269f7ea59_o.jpg">
<p>
Santorini has the shape of a crescent - this is the top of a volcano, the mouth of which went under water, and the second half of the ring also collapsed. Therefore, on the inner side the rocks drop down almost vertically, and on the other side there is a gentler descent to the water. All photographs are taken from the inside, where the two main cities stand.

Santorini has two main cities - the capital Thira (above right) in the middle of the island and Oia on the far northern corner of the crescent.

In the past, the main harbor was right under the city of Thira, where people from the liners are brought. As an attraction, mules are driven up and down here.

<h2>Delphi</h2>
<p>
Upon arrival from Crete, without stopping in Athens, I went straight to Delphi - one of the main cities of Ancient Greece, where the Delphic oracle once was. Like many other ancient Greek cities, it was abandoned for a long time, and the modern city was built in the 19th and 20th centuries for tourists who came to see the excavations.
<p/>

Delphi is located on a steep slope of a ridge of hills, below is a huge valley overgrown with forest.

The city stood on a hillside (which is quite rare in the world; cities are usually built in valleys or on the banks of rivers/sea).

The city was abandoned for many centuries, somewhere from the end of Antiquity, when paganism (and accordingly the Delphic Oracle) was banned. Since the 15th century, a few travelers have described remains that were still visible without the need to dig deep. Only at the end of the 19th century did they begin to explore the territory and remove from the ground the remains of sculptures and architectural elements, which are now stored nearby in the museum.

<h2>Larissa</h2>

Larissa (emphasis on the first syllable) is another large city in mainland Greece that almost no one visits. I got off here to break up the long drive from Delphi to Thessaloniki.

I traveled from Larissa to Thessaloniki by train, experiencing Greek railways for the first time. In general, they are normal and the price is approximately equal to buses, only they run less frequently and not to all cities.

I failed to explore the city of Thessaloniki properly - due to severe food poisoning, only in the afternoon, with an incredible effort, I was able to get up and make a circle around the local attractions in three to four hours.

Thessaloniki was a major city in the Byzantine era, so there are many monuments from the 5th to 15th centuries that are included in the World Heritage List - from large temples to small baths in back streets. For simplicity, I laid out the route to visit as many of these places as possible, crossing the city center along the way.

The ancient church turned out to be much lower than ground level due to the addition of sidewalks over centuries.

Finally I reached the end of the city center farthest from me, where the two main attractions stand. This is the Rotunda - a pagan temple (or maybe a mausoleum, we don’t know for sure), turned into a Christian one, and then into a mosque.
