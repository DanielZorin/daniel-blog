<h1>Turkey: Samsun, Amasya, Hattusa, Yozgat, Kırıkkale, Ankara</h1>
<i>2-8 September 2023</i>
<h2>Samsun</h2>
<p>
Samsun is the largest city on the Black Sea coast of Turkey, approximately halfway between Batumi and Istanbul.

<p>
The morning after my arrival, a terrible rainfall hit Samsun. In the morning, all the streets around my hotel turned into raging rivers, and it was only possible to move around by kayak.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53175864020_cf151d1a43_o.jpg" >
<p>
Even some shops were flooded, so that when the rain stopped in the middle of the day, various objects were strewn along the streets, even parts from mobile phones.
<p/>

<p>
But everything was removed very quickly. Only water from the underground passage was pumped out until almost evening.

<p/>

<p>
On May 19, 1919, Ataturk arrived by ship to Samsun, where he was appointed commander of the 9th Army. It is believed that the Turkish War of Independence began on this date.

There is a tram in Samsun, although I didn’t have a chance to ride it because the line wasn’t working that day. I had to take buses.

<h2>Amasya</h2>
<p>
Amasya is one of the most picturesque cities in Turkey.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53175630564_ebdd8e93fc_o.jpg" >
<p>
The city is located in a river valley between steep cliffs.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53175866945_c012221f03_o.jpg" >
<p>
On the north side there is a fortress and a historical center restored in Turkish style, on the south there is a modern city and an embankment for walking.

Above the historical center, the tombs of the rulers of the Pontic Kingdom (2-3 century BC) are carved into the rock. Reminiscent of the rock tombs in Lycia on the other side of the country.

Not satisfied with the view from the tombs, I took a taxi and drove to the fortress, which is at the very top of the cliff. There are no stairs to get there, only a road on the back side of the hill.

<h2>Hattusa</h2>
<p>
One of the main destinations of the trip to the north of Turkey was Hattusa - one of the last World Heritage Sites that I had not visited. Getting to Hattusa is not easy. It is located in Çorum province, 30 kilometers from the city of Sungurlu.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53175919693_69a1717a7d_o.jpg" >
<p>
Çorum is apparently famous for chickpeas (leblebi), which are at the entrance.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53175425966_d9a727faf3_o.jpg" >
<p>
It is not difficult to get to Sungurlu, since this city is on a major highway.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53175865030_794b429f7f_o.jpg" >
<p>
It's funny that at the bus station they accept Georgian laris and Azerbaijani manats, although it is very far from the border.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53175629354_df773690c8_o.jpg" >
<p>
From Sungurlu, public transport runs at best twice a day (early morning and evening), so you will have to take a taxi or hitchhike. A one-way taxi cost about $25.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53174835822_065197675e_o.jpg" >
<p>
Another difficulty here is that the ruins of the ancient city here are simply huge and scattered over a large area. There is a road between them. In principle, you can go through everything on foot, the total distance is 5-6 kilometers, although you will have to first climb up the mountain and then go down.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53175864915_5b0c897918_o.jpg" >
<p>
Hattusa was the capital of the Hittite Empire (19th-12th centuries BC).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53175629254_e5e9676aab_o.jpg" >
<p>
All over the hill, here and there, there are excavations and building foundations. Usually all ancient cities are very compact and flat, and Hattusa is extremely unusual in this regard.

<h2>Yozgat</h2>
<p>
Hattusa is located on the border of the provinces of Çorum and Yozgat; the drive to Yozgat is about 40 kilometers - not much further than to Sungurlu. I decided to visit another unfamiliar province, and from Hattusa I went south. There is no public transport there at all, so I had to hitchhike. It turned out to be relatively easy, the only difficulty is that there are very few cars on the road.

<h2>Ankara</h2>
<p>
This was my third time in Ankara, and finally in the warm season. I visited places that I couldn’t get to before for various reasons. The first is the cable car, where I even went <a href="../ankara">in December 2021</a>, but it was closed.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53175920858_221e7496bc_o.jpg" >
<p>
The cable car is a regular public transport, the ticket is the same as for the metro (in September 2023 it cost 17 lira).
<p/>
