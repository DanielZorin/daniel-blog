<h1>Lithuania: Kaunas, Vilnius</h1>
<i>30 March - 2 April 2018</i>
<h2>Kaunas</h2>
<p>
I visited Latvia and Estonia many times, especially in 2016-2017, but somehow I haven’t been able to go to Lithuania since my very first trip in 2012. And now a flight from Spain to Kaunas turned up, which means it’s time to finally test the Kaliningrad transit train.
The airport in Kaunas appears to have been reconstructed from a Soviet one.

The city is familiar.

The condition of Kaunas is far from ideal.

There are many half-abandoned, crumbling houses.

Only the center itself has been restored.

<h2>Vilnius</h2>
<p>
I checked into a cheap hotel in the northern part of Vilnius, across the river. It was about 15-20 minutes in a straight line to the historical center, but it was a very colorful place - literally a meeting of the past and the future.

This entire area consists of such village houses.

At the same time, at the end of the street stands the Vilnius business district with tall buildings.

The entrance to the hill with Gediminas' Tower is closed, so you need to look for alternatives.

Across the river, but slightly on the other side of my hotel, is the famous district of Užupis.

In honor of Independence Day, they organized a concert in the main square of the district, but it was somewhat boring.

Some old school rockers were playing and a couple of people were rocking in front of the stage.

Vilnius is very good for purchasing sanctioned goods - according to my impressions, there is more choice here than in Riga and Tallinn, and prices are lower. Plus, it’s most convenient to get here from Moscow.
