<h1>Russia: Sochi</h1>
<i>30 November - 3 December 2020</i>
<h2>Sochi</h2>
<p>
I was in Sochi last time <a href="http://goo.gl/8XUmKF">in 2015</a>. In winter this is a very pleasant place to travel - quite warm, 10-15 degrees (not minus 10). In conditions where traveling to almost all other countries is problematic to one degree or another, this is simply an ideal place.

Last time I stayed near the airport, this time in the center of Sochi.

Sochi is still the most “foreign” city in Russia after Moscow. But rather not “European”, but “American”, reminiscent of something like <a href="../miami">Miami</a>.

If it weren’t for the “Pyaterochka” sign, it could very well be Miami Beach:

It’s funny that there are very active offers to go on a yacht, like in India or Cambodia.

The downside of Sochi is that there are a lot of cars and underground passages, and often you can’t cross the street even in the center.

Sochi consists of four districts: the center of Sochi, Lazarevskoye (the longest district to the north), Adler (where the airport, Olympic Park and ski resorts in Krasnaya Polyana are) and Khosta - between Sochi and Adler. Khosta is clearly visible from the bus along the road, however, most buses pass by the city along the expressway.

<p>
The old highway passing through the city of Khosta. Previously, it seems that almost all the roads in the Sochi area were like this, overpasses were only built for the Olympics.

On the territory of the Khosta district there is a sanatorium named after Ordzhonikidze.

This sanatorium with beautiful classical buildings was closed in 2010, and has been abandoned since then.

At the same time, for some reason no one wants to buy and use it, although it would seem that the place should be in demand.
