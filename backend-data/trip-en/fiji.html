<h2>Flights</h2>
<p>
Fiji is the easternmost country in Oceania, which is visible on the world map with the naked eye thanks to the rather large round island of Viti Levu. This is the main air hub of Oceania outside of Australia and New Zealand: from here there are flights to almost all the surrounding island states, as well as direct flights to Asia: Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo. If you don't have an Australian visa, virtually the only way to get into Oceania is through Fiji, a round-trip flight from Singapore isn't even exorbitantly expensive. I flew to Fiji on a short Fiji Airways flight from Tonga.

<p>
Formally, on this flight I crossed the 180 meridian, but not the international date line - the time in Tonga and Fiji differs only by an hour.
<p/>

<p>
In addition to the two main islands of Viti Livu and Vanua Levu, there are many small atolls.

<p>
The main airport is not in Fiji's capital, Suva, but in the city of Nadi at the opposite end of the island. A ticket from Nadi to Suva costs only 20-30 dollars, so I came up with a plan: fly to Suva by plane in the morning, and return by bus in the evening, so as not to spend 4-5 hours on a one-way journey by land.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257137790_b1c28dba21_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The plane is small, the altitude is low, the distance is less than 150 kilometers in a straight line and the flight time is less than half an hour.

Soon the houses end, and the little-developed mountainous central part of the island begins.

Unlike most of the islands of Oceania that are coral atolls, Viti Levu is of volcanic origin.

Suva is in the distance, but we are flying a little further north, because the airport is about 30 kilometers from the city.

Suva Airport is called Nausori Airport because it is located in the city of the same name.

<h2>Suva</h2>
<p>
Bold taxi drivers at the airport ask for $10 to Nausori (3 km). You can leave the parking lot and catch a passing bus for less than $1. In 10 minutes I'm in Nausori.

<p>
The market city, in its atmosphere, resembles the cities of India or Bangladesh, and it is no coincidence, because a significant part of the population of Fiji are descendants of Indians, even one of the official languages ​​is Fiji-Hindi.

<p>
From the bus station you can go to Suva, or somewhere else, there are a lot of buses, including to all sorts of small villages.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257138685_ddc1d3d3ff_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The buses are also similar to Indian budget buses.
<p/>

<p>
Fiji recently introduced a system for paying bus fares throughout the island (and according to the website, on other major islands too). Now cash is not accepted at all, only e-transport cards. Local residents can get a personalized card, and tourists can buy a prepaid one. The problem is that finding where to buy it is not so easy. I wanted to buy a card worth 20 Fijian dollars (10 USD), but it wasn't sold anywhere in Nausori, they sent me from one office to another, but everywhere had only small value cards. I found it with difficulty only in Suva. However, travel over short distances costs less than 2, and the driver always has a card with a value of 2. I always boarded long-distance buses, where travel costs more than 2, in large cities, and there I had to give the card to the cashier at the station, he would print out a receipt that I showed to the driver. I suppose you can pay in cash there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256095871_b92e3ff4ab_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is what the cards look like. It seems that they can be returned at Vodafone offices to get the balance on the account back, but I had pennies left on all of them, so I kept them as a souvenir.

Life in the villages is simple: the houses are flimsy, clothes are on strings.

The most striking detail I found in Suva is that in the public toilet (very shitty, I must say) the flush tank is caged to prevent it from being stolen. It is immediately clear that this is not the most prosperous country.

People of Fiji. Although Fiji and Tonga are quite close to each other geographically, it is clear why Fiji is Melanesian and Tonga is Polynesian. People look completely different.

Navua River. There seem to be boat tours upstream along it, but I didn’t find the slightest hint of this in the city itself. I also didn’t notice a single hotel here, although there are usually several around the bus station. Tourism in Fiji is 99% packaged, with tours at very inhumane prices. For example, sailing to a paradise island with a beach for one day costs at least 150 dollars, whereas in Malaysia or Indonesia it would cost 20-30 dollars maximum, and somewhere around 10.

In this city I found a couple of travel agencies offering excursions, but I had seen their websites before too. A river cruise here costs $150, way too expensive. For comparison, in the USA, not the cheapest country to put it mildly, for $80 I went on an excursion to the Grand Canyon, where we had to drive five hours there and five hours back. In New Zealand, an excursion to Milford Sound with a cruise costs about $100, and the drive there is also four hours.

Fiji has a very unusual 7 Fijian dollar banknote. It was released to celebrate the Fiji rugby team's victory at the 2016 Olympic Games. Although this banknote is a holiday one, it is in fairly wide circulation, even I came across it.

<h2>Nadi</h2>
<p>
Nadi is the main tourist city in Fiji, so it looks better than the rest of the country. This is especially true for the area around the airport where transit passengers spend the night. When you leave the airport, the contrast with Tonga is very noticeable: instead of broken roads and an old small terminal, there is an excellent highway, traffic jams and a rather large airport.

<h2>Lautoka</h2>
<p>
Lautoka is the second largest city in Fiji. To get there, you need to go north from the airport. Along the way there are beautiful karst mountains, like in Malaysia and southern Thailand.

Fijian cities are remarkably similar. They are much more similar than Russian, American or Chinese. In fact, every Fijian city is a market where residents of surrounding villages come to buy and sell goods, plus stores of the same chains. Almost no one lives in the cities (except Suva); they end almost immediately after the market, where there are only village houses along the highway.
