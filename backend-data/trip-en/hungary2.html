<h1>Hungary: Esztergom, Nagymaros, Gödöllő, Győr</h1>
<i>25-30 November 2012</i>
<h2>Esztergom</h2>
<p>
In Esztergom, when I arrived at the station, I found a room that looked like the reception room of some Soviet government agency, with the walls covered with some kind of documents on A4 sheets. The saleswoman at the ticket office explained to me that there are no trains from here and that I need to go somewhere by bus (indeed, on the railway website next to this route there is a silhouette of a bus, and if you hover your mouse over it, the words “replacement bus” will appear). However, my modest knowledge of Hungarian was not enough to understand where this bus would go and how to get from there to Budapest, so I had to urgently go to the bus station and look for a way to leave there. This turned out to be a non-trivial matter. The Esztergom bus station is an example of extreme decay. To the credit of the station, it is worth noting that in the waiting room (if you can call so a small room with two iron benches) there is a schedule printed on a printer, and after reading it a little, you can even find out the number of the desired platform. There are no announcements over the loudspeaker, and there is no ticket office either: in a room that resembled a ticket office, I was sent to buy a ticket for the bus itself. As a result of all these shenanigans, I barely made it to the bus and didn’t have time to take a proper photo of the station. All that remains is a photograph of the masterpiece sign that says “station.”

<p>
The Hungarian province as a whole gives the impression of complete ruin and depression.
<p/>

<p>
The cities are mostly built up with dull panel houses surrounded by prison fences.
<p/>

<p>
Every second house has a sign that it is for sale ('elado' in Hungarian).

But individual houses are destroyed.

<p>
A strange screen for accessing the Internet (judging by the @ sign above). I saw two of these, neither showed signs of life.

The main attraction of Esztergom is the basilica, one of the largest in the world.

On the opposite bank of the Danube is Slovakia, I will talk about it later.

<h2>Nagymaros - Visegrad</h2>
<p>
On the road to Esztergom there are villages that are similar to each other: each will have a church of approximately the same design and many “for sale” signs.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256761245_5c2040896e_o.jpg">
<p>
The village of Nagymaros is notable mainly for the fact that the ferry for Visegrad runs here. I was late for the ferry, not finding the ticket office in time, so I had a whole hour to explore this village.
<p/>

<p>
The street signs here resemble old Russian ones.

The central alley is pleasing to the eye.
<p/>

Among the many monuments is a memorial to those killed in three major national tragedies in Hungary: two world wars and the 1956 uprising.
<p/>

<p>
In Visegrad you can climb to the castle on the hill, but November is not the best time for such activities. In addition to the castle, there is a monument with a signature in Spanish.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257603214_dc6b7f3688_o.jpg">
<p>
There is also abstract art.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255716391_c5a0bb440c_o.jpg">
<p>
And absolutely deserted streets. I didn’t see a single living soul in Visegrad.
<p/>

Except for the man who came out of the door of this building, played a little drum, and went inside again.

<h2>Gödöllő</h2>
<p>

There's not much to see in Gödöllo. The palace has not yet been completely renovated.
<p/>

<p>
The area around the central square is well kept.
<p/>

Beyond its borders, familiar residential areas begin.

<p/>

<p>
I experienced cognitive dissonance when I saw the writing at the bottom of the gong. It turned out that this is indeed the Indonesian language. After the terrorist attacks in Bali, Indonesians made it a tradition to give the “peace gong” to different cities. Gödöllö is one of them.

<h2>Győr</h2>
<p>
Győr is the most beautiful Hungarian city I have visited.
<p/>

Parking is the same as in Moscow, 50 rubles per hour, even a little more.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256159471_54fb04a34b_o.jpg">
<p>
Right in the center are archaeological excavations.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256159406_ed3040d14f_o.jpg">
<p>
There are at least two Turul monuments in Győr. One sits on each of the bridge supports.
<p/>

Memorial plaque in memory of the deceased in 1956. A Hungarian tradition is to hang several wreaths directly on the wall.
<p/>

<p>
The station deserves special mention.
<p/>
