<h1>Spain: Madrid</h1>

<h2>Madrid</h2>
<p>
One of the main attractions of Madrid is the street name signs, which are made here with great love. Each street in the central part of the city, even small alleys, has its own unique design. The image illustrates the name of the street.

Some houses have the inscription "Manzana", this word means not only "apple", but also "block of houses".

They also often indicate here that the house is insured against fire (asegurada de incendios)

In the literary quarter, where the houses of Cervantes and Lope de Vega are located, road signs from the old series, in relief, have been preserved.

Sometimes the text is essentially equivalent to a plaque, like the one at Lope de Vega's house.

It turns out that in Spain football players also have certificates. I wonder who and when they present them to? To be allowed into the locker room if suddenly the local guard doesn’t recognize them? Here is Zidane's ID.

When I get to Spain in the summer, and not in the early spring, I will definitely go to a bullfight. In Madrid I visited the main bullring and the adjacent museum.

The food in Madrid, as in all of Spain, is simply excellent. You can eat for 200 rubles ($7) in the central square. In Madrid, there is the oldest restaurant in the world, where you can order a whole roasted pig for a ridiculous amount of around 20 euros.

But the main thing is that Madrid has a special atmosphere. There is always some kind of movement in the central square. Here are the residents of the Democratic Republic of the Congo demanding the overthrow of the bloody dictator. Another time there was a huge crowd of students protesting against the crackdown on a demonstration in Valencia.

Some Christian sectarians usually handed out postcards with links to the site damemasinfo.com (“Give me information”), but one day a preacher stood up in a cowboy hat, shouting to the entire square that they needed to repent. The man standing to his left was translating from English to Spanish.
