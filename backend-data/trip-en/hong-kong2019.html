<h2>Hong Kong</h2>
<p>
This is the third time I came to Hong Kong. Although in <a href="http://goo.gl/r1nHyV">2013</a> and <a href="http://goo.gl/WJZh5P">2015</a> I was here in total 15 days, there are still many interesting places in Hong Kong where you can go. This is probably one of my favorite cities.
<p/>

I stayed, as always, at Chungking mansions in Kowloon.

The prices remained the same, I even checked into the same hotel and almost the same room.

Once I went deep into Kowloon to look at the place where Kowloon Walled City was located. The nearest metro station is Lok Fu.
<p/>

<p>
Kowloon Walled City is a legendary place, somewhere between Chungking mansions and Brazilian favelas. 50 thousand people lived on an area of ​​26 thousand square meters! Even taking into account 10 floors, this is 5 square meters for each. The city was controlled by criminal triads, but most likely, as in the favelas, most of the residents were just ordinary poor people, and not masters of the underworld.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256388613_038180ecfe_o.jpg">
<p>
In 1993, the city was completely demolished, and now in its place is this park.

On the other side there used to be Hong Kong Airport, famous for its extreme landings with a turn right in front of the windows of the houses behind the runway.

I've been to Hong Kong Island many times, but since I always lived on the other side, I always went there on the Star Ferry and never walked further than the Times Square area (not counting trips to Victoria Peak and remote areas on the other side of the island behind the peak) . In general, Hong Kong Island is not limited to the center; there are still many densely populated areas with high-rise buildings.

A trip to Hong Kong would be incomplete without an expedition to the New Territories or distant islands. This time I went to look at the abandoned villages of Hong Kong. Yes, in Hong Kong, where real estate is astronomically expensive, where people live in apartments of 10 square meters, there are entire abandoned villages with empty houses where no one lives.

The Hakka people lived in this area. It seems that most of them left back in the 1960s - 1970s, when, along with a large influx of refugees from China, farming in Hong Kong became unprofitable. Some moved to the city center, others even further, to the UK, to which Hong Kong belonged until 1997.

You can walk along the coast for a long time, there will be more villages, but getting back is not so easy - only on a rare ferry over a very long distance or on foot along the same road. The map showed a straight road through the hills, I decided to try to use it and turned deeper.
