<h2>Hong Kong</h2>
<p>
This is the third time I came to Hong Kong. Although in <a href="../hong-kong">2013</a> and <a href="../hong-kong2015">2015</a> I was here in total 15 days, there are still many interesting places in Hong Kong where you can go. This is probably one of my favorite cities.
<p/>

<p>
I stayed, as always, at Chungking mansions in Kowloon.
<p/>

<p>
Nothing has changed here.

<p>
The prices remained the same, I even checked into the same hotel and almost the same room.

<p>
Once I went deep into Kowloon to look at the place where Kowloon Walled City was located. The nearest metro station is Lok Fu.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256189821_fed46ae96e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Kowloon Walled City is a legendary place, somewhere between Chungking mansions and Brazilian favelas. 50 thousand people lived on an area of ​​26 thousand square meters! Even taking into account 10 floors, this is 5 square meters for each. The city was controlled by criminal triads, but most likely, as in the favelas, most of the residents were just ordinary poor people, and not masters of the underworld.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256388613_e8115ed20c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In 1993, the city was completely demolished, and now in its place is this park.

On the other side there used to be Hong Kong Airport, famous for its extreme landings with a turn right in front of the windows of the houses behind the runway.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257233125_8dc1d81d90_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The airport was closed in 1998 and has now been converted into a cruise terminal.

<p>
I've been to Hong Kong Island many times, but since I always lived on the other side, I always went there on the Star Ferry and never walked further than the Times Square area (not counting trips to Victoria Peak and remote areas on the other side of the island behind the peak) . In general, Hong Kong Island is not limited to the center; there are still many densely populated areas with high-rise buildings.
<p/>

Inscription on the road for car drivers. As you can see, the ruke that you have to turn from the tram tracks exists here too, but here it’s not to the left, but to the right, since traffic is on the left.

A trip to Hong Kong would be incomplete without an expedition to the New Territories or distant islands. This time I went to look at the abandoned villages of Hong Kong. Yes, in Hong Kong, where real estate is astronomically expensive, where people live in apartments of 10 square meters, there are entire abandoned villages with empty houses where no one lives.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256939374_4fddb17efe_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p>
Near the civilization stop, there are a couple of eateries and a number of residential buildings.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256389938_ff2ca4deca_h.jpg"/>
<p>
We need to walk along the shore of the bay on the footpath.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256389968_20dfc610d0_h.jpg"/>

<p/>

<p>
On the other side of the bay it is already China, the city of Yantian.

At some point the road rises sharply to go over a hill.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257751820_ce8fec8c82_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is untouched nature all around.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256939044_416bc4f3fb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And here is the village of Fung Hang. The building in the foreground is a public toilet, it works and is kept clean.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256191241_74bc1dfa92_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But most of the remaining buildings are abandoned.

<p>
Some are boarded up and clearly uninhabited, but they are still standing firmly; apparently, someone monitors them periodically and prevents them from collapsing.

You can look into an abandoned house.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256939219_0a9b91cd8b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The Hakka people lived in this area. It seems that most of them left back in the 1960s - 1970s, when, along with a large influx of refugees from China, farming in Hong Kong became unprofitable. Some moved to the city center, others even further, to the UK, to which Hong Kong belonged until 1997.
<p/>

We go further along the coast to the next village.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257234185_393e2495da_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here it is.

Abandoned school.

<p>
You can walk along the coast for a long time, there will be more villages, but getting back is not so easy - only on a rare ferry over a very long distance or on foot along the same road. The map showed a straight road through the hills, I decided to try to use it and turned deeper.
<p/>
