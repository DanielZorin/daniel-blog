<h1>Lebanon: Beirut, Jounieh, Baalbek, Byblos, Batroun, Tripoli, Saida, Sur</h1>
<i>16-21 November 2022</i>
<h2>Beirut</h2>
<p>
Lebanon is not just another Arab country in the Middle East. Here, historically, the majority of residents were Christians, hence more liberal morals: alcohol, casinos, etc. are allowed. Lebanon was the center of trade and entertainment in the region, but in 2019 a debt crisis came, and in 2020, in addition to Covid, saltpeter exploded in the port of Beirut, causing colossal destruction. In four years, Lebanon's GDP fell by 50%, and the Lebanese pound fell from 1,500 to 40,000 per dollar (and this is the black market rate, that is, you cannot pay by card in Lebanon). Now the center of Beirut is practically a ghost town.

<p>
The evening after my arrival, I went to see the city center and buy something, but it turned out that the busy area with boutiques was no longer lively. The streets are empty, all restaurants are closed.
<p/>

<p>
Surprisingly, the boutiques themselves are open, there are guards in jackets at the entrance, but there are no visitors in sight.

<p>
There was a checkpoint at the entrance to the central area, so I didn’t go there.
<p/>

<p>
The next day I explored this place in more detail and found a passage not blocked by fences, although I still had to exit through the checkpoint on the other side. It turned out that the center, in principle, is not closed to the public, bored soldiers with machine guns let you inside, it’s just that everything there is closed, and almost no one goes there. And it is cordoned off because the parliament building is located there, and the authorities do not want protests near it (it was no longer possible to approach the building itself).

I stayed in an apartment in the center of Beirut via airbnb. The ad promised electricity for 24 hours, and this was true (sometimes it was cut off just for a few seconds). In general, in Beirut there is no electricity supply for several hours a day, only generators work 24/7.
<p/>

The apartment is quite old-fashioned.

In the sea off the coast of Beirut you can see rocks called Pigeon rocks.

<p>
This place is very reminiscent of Australia - the rocks are similar to <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/549175.html">"The Twelve Apostles"</a>, and the architecture is similar.

<p>
There are shops and restaurants here, but I would not say that this place looks like a typical city center, since there are quite narrow streets and a lot of cars, there is nowhere to arrange a promenade.

In Beirut, you can just go and buy jamon, and at a normal price. In Turkey, Georgia and <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/739784.html">Greece</a> it is much more difficult.

<h2>Jounieh</h2>
<p>
North of Beirut on the coast begins the city of Jounieh, once the center of tourism and entertainment in Lebanon, where there were many luxury hotels, casinos and restaurants. Due to the crisis, the city now looks shabby, but nevertheless it deserves a visit at least for the Jeita Cave and the cable car.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52522498390_38829e6e3a_o.jpg">
<p>
First of all, I went to Jeita Cave. This is one of the most popular and famous caves in the world. More precisely, there are two whole caves here - in the upper one you can walk on foot, and in the lower one everything is flooded, and visitors are taken on a boat.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52522565873_c3906a5bb1_o.jpg">
<p>
For some strange logic, photography is prohibited in the caves. At the bottom they took away my entire bag, and at the top only my phone, so I clicked once on the DSLR.

<h2>Baalbek</h2>
<p>
The city of Baalbek is located in the Bekaa Valley, which runs north to south between the mountains of coastal Lebanon and the border with Syria. This region is predominantly inhabited by Shia Muslims, and is dominated by the notorious Hezbollah group (which is not considered terrorist in Russia). Baalbek is famous for its ancient Roman temples that have few competitors in Europe in terms of scale and preservation.

<h2>Byblos</h2>
<p>
Byblos (Jubail in Arabic) is known for the fact that it is, by many estimates, the oldest inhabited city in the world today - it is 8-10 thousand years old. The excavations are included in the World Heritage List.

<h2>Tripoli</h2>
<p>
Tripoli is the second largest city in Lebanon, located in the very north. This is a Muslim city, and Sunni, not Shia (like Baalbek and Sur), so there are no Hezbollah posters here. However, it contrasts sharply with neighboring Batroun and Byblos - while there was a Mediterranean resort atmosphere, here it is more like something between India and Italy.

There is an exhibition center in Tripoli, which was built by the architect Oscar Niemeyer (creator of <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/684705.html">Brasilia</a>), but it can only be viewed from afar through the fence.

<h2>Saida</h2>
<p>
The city of Saida (historical name: Sidon) is located south of Beirut, in the Muslim part of Lebanon. The historical center is well preserved here, as in <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/729352.html">Yazd</a> and <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/733166.html">Urfa</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52522562593_e57ce4c508_o.jpg">

<p>
The center is a labyrinth of small streets, which are not even very well marked on maps, so in some places you need to navigate at random.

<h2>Sur</h2>
<p>
The city of Sur (historical name: Tyre) is located in the very south of Lebanon, near the border with Israel. The border areas are controlled by Hezbollah and you cannot go there, Sur is the only safe place. The Roman ruins at Sur are listed as a World Heritage Site.
