<h1>Lebanon: Beirut, Jounieh, Baalbek, Byblos, Batroun, Tripoli, Saida, Sur</h1>
<i>16-21 November 2022</i>
<h2>Beirut</h2>
<p>
Lebanon is not just another Arab country in the Middle East. Here, historically, the majority of residents were Christians, hence more liberal morals: alcohol, casinos, etc. are allowed. Lebanon was the center of trade and entertainment in the region, but in 2019 a debt crisis came, and in 2020, in addition to Covid, saltpeter exploded in the port of Beirut, causing colossal destruction. In four years, Lebanon's GDP fell by 50%, and the Lebanese pound fell from 1,500 to 40,000 per dollar (and this is the black market rate, that is, you cannot pay by card in Lebanon). Now the center of Beirut is practically a ghost town.

<p>
The evening after my arrival, I went to see the city center and buy something, but it turned out that the busy area with boutiques was no longer lively. The streets are empty, all restaurants are closed.
<p/>

<p>
Surprisingly, the boutiques themselves are open, there are guards in jackets at the entrance, but there are no visitors in sight.

<p>
There was a checkpoint at the entrance to the central area, so I didn’t go there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52522502015_9df9ee00d5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The next day I explored this place in more detail and found a passage not blocked by fences, although I still had to exit through the checkpoint on the other side. It turned out that the center, in principle, is not closed to the public, bored soldiers with machine guns let you inside, it’s just that everything there is closed, and almost no one goes there. And it is cordoned off because the parliament building is located there, and the authorities do not want protests near it (it was no longer possible to approach the building itself).

The square with the clock tower was once very lively.

Many approaches to the center are blocked by concrete blocks and barbed wire.

The beautiful building with columns was simply covered with bricks.

The central square is the Square of Martyrs.

The cinema building with bullet marks has been standing here since the war that took place in the early 2000s.

I stayed in an apartment in the center of Beirut via airbnb. The ad promised electricity for 24 hours, and this was true (sometimes it was cut off just for a few seconds). In general, in Beirut there is no electricity supply for several hours a day, only generators work 24/7.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52522300544_0bcdb36a81_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The apartment is quite old-fashioned.

In the sea off the coast of Beirut you can see rocks called Pigeon rocks.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52521556467_e44c354e13_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This place is very reminiscent of Australia - the rocks are similar to <a href="../melbourne">"The Twelve Apostles"</a>, and the architecture is similar.

The Hamra district begins from the embankment. It is now the de facto center of the city (since the historical center is closed).

<p>
There are shops and restaurants here, but I would not say that this place looks like a typical city center, since there are quite narrow streets and a lot of cars, there is nowhere to arrange a promenade.

The area adjacent to the port suffered the most from the explosion, there is no longer a bus station and many damaged abandoned buildings.

On the first evening I found a large supermarket and was stunned by the assortment.

In Beirut, you can just go and buy jamon, and at a normal price. In Turkey, Georgia and <a href="../chios">Greece</a> it is much more difficult.

<p>
Either they were abandoned, or there is actually a lot of real estate construction here. Perhaps the Lebanese are buying houses en masse to save money from inflation.

<h2>Jounieh</h2>
<p>
North of Beirut on the coast begins the city of Jounieh, once the center of tourism and entertainment in Lebanon, where there were many luxury hotels, casinos and restaurants. Due to the crisis, the city now looks shabby, but nevertheless it deserves a visit at least for the Jeita Cave and the cable car.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52522498390_5778cbfbd4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
First of all, I went to Jeita Cave. This is one of the most popular and famous caves in the world. More precisely, there are two whole caves here - in the upper one you can walk on foot, and in the lower one everything is flooded, and visitors are taken on a boat.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52522565873_cb72a25727_h.jpg"/>
<p>
For some strange logic, photography is prohibited in the caves. At the bottom they took away my entire bag, and at the top only my phone, so I clicked once on the DSLR.

<p>
There is also a cable car, but it does not work. Walking there is less than a kilometer.

<p>
From the cave I took a taxi straight to the cable car.
<p/>

From the upper cable car station you can take a cable car or walk a little further.

It seems to have fallen into disrepair locally earlier than four years ago. Or did it collapse so quickly?

<h2>Baalbek</h2>
<p>
The city of Baalbek is located in the Bekaa Valley, which runs north to south between the mountains of coastal Lebanon and the border with Syria. This region is predominantly inhabited by Shia Muslims, and is dominated by the notorious Hezbollah group (which is not considered terrorist in Russia). Baalbek is famous for its ancient Roman temples that have few competitors in Europe in terms of scale and preservation.

It all starts out pretty typical.

Large pieces with decor and ornaments lie everywhere; usually these are transferred to museums.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52522028331_ee8fc5714a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Along the edges of the square, semicircular halls are very well preserved.

Approaching the edge, you realize that you have risen to such a considerable height. In the Middle Ages, this territory was generally used as a castle.

<p>
The most important thing here is the Temple of Bacchus. It is not easy to remember where a Roman temple is still preserved almost entirely, with walls and columns. I remember the temple in <a href="../armenia">Garni</a> and the Pantheon in Rome.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52522505455_9e1c487680_h.jpg"/>

The columns themselves and the decor under the roof above them have been preserved.

In this part of the country, portraits of Syrian President Assad are often found along the roads. I also saw a portrait of Imam Khomeini, and of Hezbollah leaders, of course.

<h2>Byblos</h2>
<p>
Byblos (Jubail in Arabic) is known for the fact that it is, by many estimates, the oldest inhabited city in the world today - it is 8-10 thousand years old. The excavations are included in the World Heritage List.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52522297709_f1be409474_h.jpg"/>

<h2>Batroun</h2>
<p>
To the north of Byblos is the city of Batroun, which is only about 15-20 minutes away. This is also an ancient Phoenician city, but less popular.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52522572018_dd5c0718b5_h.jpg"/>

<h2>Tripoli</h2>
<p>
Tripoli is the second largest city in Lebanon, located in the very north. This is a Muslim city, and Sunni, not Shia (like Baalbek and Sur), so there are no Hezbollah posters here. However, it contrasts sharply with neighboring Batroun and Byblos - while there was a Mediterranean resort atmosphere, here it is more like something between India and Italy.
<p/>

But if you go around it, there is a cool view of the poor areas on the hill opposite.

There is an exhibition center in Tripoli, which was built by the architect Oscar Niemeyer (creator of <a href="../brasilia">Brasilia</a>), but it can only be viewed from afar through the fence.

<h2>Saida</h2>
<p>
The city of Saida (historical name: Sidon) is located south of Beirut, in the Muslim part of Lebanon. The historical center is well preserved here, as in <a href="../yazd">Yazd</a> and <a href="../sanliurfa">Urfa</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52522562593_68facebdd2_h.jpg"/>

<p>
The center is a labyrinth of small streets, which are not even very well marked on maps, so in some places you need to navigate at random.

<h2>Sur</h2>
<p>
The city of Sur (historical name: Tyre) is located in the very south of Lebanon, near the border with Israel. The border areas are controlled by Hezbollah and you cannot go there, Sur is the only safe place. The Roman ruins at Sur are listed as a World Heritage Site.

The bus station is quite far from the city center, there are areas near it that look like slums. There is a checkpoint on every lane, so I ended up taking pictures there.
