<h1>Nagorno-Karabakh</h1>
<i>5 May 2014</i>
<p>
Nagorno-Karabakh is an unrecognized state (like <a href="../wsahara">Western Sahara</a>, <a href="../transnistria">Transnistria</a>, <a href="../northern-cyprus">Northern Cyprus</a>, South Ossetia and Kosovo). The enmity between Armenians and Azerbaijanis has deep roots; there were massacres here during the 1905 revolution, and after the collapse of Russia in 1917 there was a full-fledged war. After the collapse of the USSR in 1991, a new war began, preceded by ethnical purges and pogroms starting in 1988. From a tactical point of view, the conflict is reminiscent of the current war in eastern Ukraine. The people's militia of Nagorno-Karabakh fought with the Azerbaijani army, which was accused of committing genocide, and Azerbaijan refused to even recognize the NKR as a party to the conflict, viewing what was happening as a war with Armenia itself. Now there is not a single Azerbaijani in Karabakh, although before the war there were 20% of them, and the share was increasing: let’s say “thank you” to the Soviet government for laying dynamite in its foundation and creating the basis for the future balkanization of the country. De facto, Karabakh is practically a region of Armenia. Most maps of the country in Armenia also depict Karabakh, although it is painted in a different color. Here the currency is Armenian, there is essentially no border, the front line is controlled by the Armenian military, and people can get Armenian passports if they want to go abroad.

About 150 thousand people live in Karabakh, of which 50 thousand live in the capital, Stepanakert. The territory of Karabakh consists mainly of mountains like these.

Just a road.

<p>
The city of Berdzor (Lachin) was not formally part of the Nagorno-Karabakh autonomy, but was one of the first to be taken under control, since the only good road to Karabakh from Armenia passes through it.

Stepanakert is an unexpectedly advanced city.

<p>
There are banners in English.

Street signs in English. At the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where we received the registration document, European tourists were found.

<p>
Benches, like in <a href="../armenia">Yerevan</a>, only with the inscription “Yerevan - Stepanakert” (by the way, Armenian inscriptions are a great chance to try yourself in the role of Sherlock Holmes, solving the dancing men).

Donuts. To convert to USD, divide by 300. By the way, May 9 is not only Victory Day, but also the day of the capture of the city of Shushi - an important event in the Karabakh war.

There is Wi-fi in the central square.

They are building their own analogue of the Yerevan “cascade” on the central square.

A little further away is the current cascade.

For a post-war city, Stepanakert looks good.

It doesn’t reach <a href="../chechnya">Grozny</a>, but it’s better than <a href="../transnistria">Tiraspol</a>, <a href="../vukovar">Vukovar</a> and Tskhinvali.

All important infrastructure facilities have been rebuilt, like this school standing opposite the building in the previous photo.

<p>
Nearby is the city of Shushi. It was the only city in Karabakh where mainly Azerbaijanis lived. Shushi is located on high hills above Stepanakert; during the war, the capital was shelled from here with Grad missiles.

<p>
Now there are much more ruins left in Shushi than in Stepanakert.

Some are decorated artistically.

The rest of the houses seem to be fine. As far as I understand, mostly Armenian refugees from Azerbaijan live here, because... the pre-war Azerbaijani population was expelled.

<p>
The fortress in Shushi is in rather mediocre condition, but it seems to be repaired. You can climb anywhere, like in <a href="../chechnya">Derbent</a>.

The monument to the bearded soldier who was one of the leaders of the self-defense units, later the Prime Minister of Armenia.

The Karabakh flag is everywhere adjacent to the Armenian one.

<p>
The pixelated pattern on the Karabakh flag is reminiscent of the brick patterns on buildings in Armenia.

<p>
From Shushi we had to go back to Armenia. A record for the length of waiting for the Caucasus was set here - more than 30 minutes. During this time, three cars passed by, two of which were full.

All that was left was to admire the view.
