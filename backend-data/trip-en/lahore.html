<h1>Pakistan: Lahore, Multan, Sukkur, Larkana, Hyderabad, Karachi</h1>

<h2>Lahore</h2>
<p>
Lahore is the second largest city in Pakistan and the capital of the state of Punjab. It is considered a “cultural capital”, as monuments from the era of the Mughal Empire, of which Lahore was the capital, have been preserved here.

Two places in Lahore are listed as World Heritage Sites: fort and Shalimar garden. I went to the garden first, since it is not quite in the center. Like other Persian and Indian gardens, it is surrounded by a high fence.

<p>
The garden turned out to be shabby and unkempt, the grass was partially trampled.

The border with India lies 10 kilometers from Lahore. I have already been at <a href="../delhi">this border</a> in 2017, from the other side, I watched the border closing ceremony. I didn’t miss the opportunity to come here again to see it from Pakistan’s side.

The advantage of the Pakistani side is that there are fewer people here and the stands are closer. And here foreigners are seated not in the gallery, as in India, but in the lower stands.

<h2>Multan</h2>
<p>
I decided to break up the long road south from Lahore with a stop in the large city of Multan in southern Punjab.

Pakistani trains have three classes. The first segment I rode in the most expensive one, AC Business. These are essentially six-seater coupes.

The downside of Pakistani train stations is that there are no boards or announcements at all. Although the trains have numbers, they are not signed anywhere on the cars, only the starting and ending stations are written in Urdu - it is not enough to know Arabic letters, you also need to know where your train is going.

<h2>Sukkur</h2>
<p>
I came to Sukkur with the intention of spending the night in a hotel near the station, taking a walk and then moving on to Mohenjo-Daro. However, there were no hotels near the station; I took a tuk-tuk to the area where there are hotels, and for some reason almost all of them were full, except for one, the most expensive one, where the room cost about $50. The hotel staff reported me to the police, and as a result, the next morning they started calling me from there. All calls were something like this:
- As-salamu alaikum!
- Wa-alaikum as-salaam
- [something in Urdu]
- Could you speak in English please?
- [something in Urdu]
- Sorry, I don't understand
- [hangs up]

After the fifth time I gave up and stopped responding.

The police were already waiting for me at the exit from the hotel. First they asked about my plans. They were quite satisfied with my plans to explore local attractions. After which I was put into a police car along with a security guard armed with a machine gun and taken to the local temple.

Cows walk like in India. Sindh is the most “Indian” region of Pakistan. There is most garbage, dirt and beggars here.

The Hindu temple is located on an island on the Indus River. From a distance it looks like this. I was told that the ferry is only in the evening.

The fortress, as it turns out, is used by the military. But with my police escorts we were allowed inside. We sat on the veranda, shook hands, and the colonel treated everyone to mango shakes. I was allowed to photograph views of the river (but not the fortifications).

Mohenjo-Daro is the most expensive museum in Pakistan, with entry costing $10 for foreigners. Judging by the book, I was the only foreigner that day, but the day before there was one Japanese visitor there.

Mohenjo-Daro existed approximately 2600-1500 years ago, was one of the largest cities of the Harappan civilization - the very first in South Asia.

<h2>Hyderabad</h2>
<p>
I like to visit cities with the same name in different countries:
- Granada (Spain) and Granada (Nicaragua)
- Merida (Spain) and Merida (Mexico)
- Basseterre (Saint Kitts and Nevis) and Basseterre (Guadeloupe)
- Newcastle (England) and Newcastle (Australia)
- Obidos (Portugal) and Obidos (Brazil)
- And even Auckland (New Zealand) and Oakland (USA), although they are written differently in English, but the same in Russian.
I have already been to the city <a href="../hyderabad">Hyderabad</a> in India. The Hyderabad pair are almost certainly the largest pair of cities with the same name by population - the Indian one has a population of almost 7 million, and the Pakistani one has a population of about 2 million. Hyderabad means "city of lions".

It was not clear from the map whether it was possible to exit the fortress on the other side by going through it. I came across one dead end, then another, after which the locals told me to go down the inconspicuous stairs under the house. It turned out that this was a staircase under the fortress wall!

I walked around the center of Karachi, past several iconic colonial-era buildings. The first is the market.

It is very difficult to move around Karachi. There is very little public transport for such a large city, only a few normal bus routes and one metrobus route, which did not reach the center. The metro is not even planned. There are also no traffic lights for pedestrians at all, and many streets are very difficult to cross. You need to ride a tuk-tuk all the time.

<h2>Hub</h2>
<p>
One of the main regions of Pakistan, Balochistan, is considered unsafe. Most often, it is crossed under armed escort by those traveling overland from the Iranian border. The main road and cities of Balochistan are closer to the Afghan border, but if you look at the map, Balochistan is huge, it is the largest region of Pakistan, and most of it is in the south along the Arabian Sea. And there is nothing there, there are practically no large cities on the coast from Karachi to the border with Iran (although there is a small city of Gwadar, which Pakistan bought from Oman back in 1958). At the same time, Balochistan begins literally just outside the city of Karachi, so I decided to mark it on the map on <a href="https://nomadmania.travel/profile/911">Nomadmania</a>. I got into a taxi, and after about 50 minutes of driving along a poor highway with trucks, I reached the city of Hub.
