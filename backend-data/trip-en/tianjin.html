<h1>China: Tianjin, Beijing, Taishan, Qufu, Jinan, Hengshui, Pingyao, Xian</h1>

<h2>Tianjin</h2>
<p>
There is a city called Tianjin, next door to Beijing, which is one of the largest in China in terms of population, but no one goes there and no one knows what’s there. I thought, just for fun, to take a one-day trip from Beijing, but it turned out that from Dalian it was cheaper to take a plane ticket to Tianjin airport than to Beijing, and so I settled in a hotel near the Tianjin train station. And then it turned out that Tianjin is an incredibly cool city, for which not only one, but even two days are not enough.

<p>
In the mid-19th century, China, which had previously been a very closed country, lost two “opium” wars and was forced to allow trade with European countries. Some territories were given actual ownership to foreigners. By the way, all modern large Chinese seaports: Dalian, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Xiamen, were founded by Europeans, while the Chinese themselves always built their cities in the interior of the mainland (it seems the Chinese understand how to live comfortably). Tianjin, located in close proximity to the capital and controlling the route from the sea to Beijing, was of strategic importance, so part of the city’s territory was given over to “concessions.”

<p>
There are many buildings left from those times that were built by concessionaires. Now in Tianjin, between the typical Chinese skyscrapers, you can find real Europe.

Here is the English concession, it looks very authentic.

If I showed you this photo, would anyone be able to guess that this is China?

<p>
English houses have the typical Chinese character for “happiness”, which hangs on every second door in China.

It’s not clear where the remake is and where the original is.

But of all the Chinese regions stylized as Europe, only this one looks natural and not comical.

Bridges. In many cities, such an ornate bridge would be an iconic place, but in China there are a ton of them in any city.

Now let's see what is typically Chinese in Tianjin.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254890707_906aef1a7f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
For example, there is a tourist street here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255621426_d11012530b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
All around are typical Chinese historical props from souvenir shops.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256667205_870fcfa7e1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Real Chinese flavor across the street.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256667310_8e4697541b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There's a flea market right in the middle of the street.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255621521_537a7e1723_h.jpg"/>
<p>
By the way, about constrictions. In China, they love to hang red banners everywhere with slogans written in white font.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255621031_843b9add48_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Residential buildings.

<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255620636_658754950a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
An interesting building, similar to the main hotel of <a href="../mongolia">Ulaanbaatar</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256120052_e7e27f5c74_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The panorama of the city is quite chaotic, although the most important part along the river is gradually emerging.
<p/>

<p>

<p/>

<p>
New skyscrapers are being built.
<p/>

<p>
One of the most unusual attractions in Tianjin is the porcelain house.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255621676_a7fc8cbdf8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Most of all it resembles some creation of Gaudi.

<p>
Like any self-respecting Chinese city, Tianjin has a large park with a lake, paths, pavilions and boats.
<p/>

And with stones.

On one of the squares I found a market for brides and grooms. You can post an ad here.

<h2>Beijing</h2>
<p>
I was in Beijing for three whole weeks in 2008, shortly after the Olympics, but then I never went to the local working-class areas, which in Beijing are called “hutongs,” or simply slums. This time, in order to correct this oversight, I settled right in the middle of one of the hutongs.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256952375_81e630936b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are a huge number of cheap hotels in the hutongs located south of Tiananmen Square, but the chances of a foreigner staying in them are absolutely zero. Everyone will send you to nearby Chinese chains like Super 8 and Motel 99, where room prices are around 250 yuan ($40). When it was 1200 rubles, I would not have minded, but now I preferred to look for something cheaper. The solution was found on agoda.com for only 80 yuan, with adventure we even managed to agree to check in directly without a reservation, so as not to pay a commission to the site. The hotel turned out to be very good.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256660159_d3a0217ef6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Beijing is the most sleek of all Chinese cities. All trade, cheap eateries and other amenities were removed from the streets, driving it all into hutongs and enclosing them with a wall.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255910721_b8beeafd6f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You walk along a typical dusty Beijing street with fences, and you wouldn’t think that life is in full swing behind the wall.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255181237_33103f9808_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The walls are surprisingly blank, entrances inside are very rare, despite the dense grid of streets inside.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255181302_d22685acd7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
If you go into the hutong, at first the picture will be something like this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256920608_ee89c8b175_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And then - like this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256110913_f7afddf28d_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>

Beijing courtyard.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256112878_37f299858d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the hutongs, every house has some kind of business. When you walk down the street in the evening, you can clearly see through the window that many houses consist of one room in which something is done: someone sews clothes, some have a hairdresser with one chair. Those who don’t know how to do anything make a store in their hallway, with an enchantingly modest assortment, for example, only instant noodles and soda.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255181792_57a9454d0e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Or here’s a popular family business in China: a sex shop.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257762280_903fd35672_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are, of course, more shops.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256112833_29b5037be3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And vegetable markets.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256112023_ae01974b44_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Cheap dining place. Dumplings for 6 yuan per plate, soups for 2-3 yuan, vegetarian noodles for 10 yuan, with meat for 15, rice dishes for 10-15 yuan.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255910701_f50fafcac6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Two portions of dumplings for 6 yuan.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256921103_73ebcdf688_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are also more reputable restaurants, for example, "Chongqing Fragrant Frog" with spicy Sichuan cuisine.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255991457_abefd588e5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The dishes here cost 20 or even 40 yuan, but these are practically culinary delights. The dish on the left needs to be eaten very quickly, otherwise you can burn your mouth.
<p/>

<p>
In the hutongs you can even find artifacts from bygone times.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255991287_82e7a76429_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Or clouds of wires that do not exist on the main streets of Beijing.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256112658_983d985988_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the hutongs, many people's houses are so small that they do not have a toilet, so there are public restrooms everywhere.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255911331_c56c723ca5_h.jpg"/>

<p>
By the way, I took all these photographs within a one-kilometer radius of Tiananmen Square.
<p/>
<center> * * * </center>
<p>
As I already said, Beijing is the most official and sleek city in China. Beijing has two symbols. The first, of course, is the fence. Do you want to go directly to the tower? OK, try.
</p>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256111008_060e214a39_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The entrance to the metro is decorated with a snake of fences.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255180057_7e73e0127e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I'm afraid to even try to count how many fences block this road.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256952620_9785da0dd0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In Beijing there are even sliding fences, and behind them there are security officers in suits, constantly guarding the entrance to the palace.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256952795_70c5a3c1d6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
To enter the main square, you need to go through security, just like at an airport. Moreover, there are still cops walking around the square and around it, checking the “registration” of those who come in large numbers. However, they don’t pay attention to foreigners.
<p/>

<p/>

<p>
The changes are clear: in six and a half years, flowers were removed around the tiger statue in the zoo and barbed wire was installed.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255180292_6bdcc1fded_h.jpg"/>
<p>
For comparison: here is a photo from 2008.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256657469_07c8e817d1_c.jpg"/>
<p>
The zoo itself is still great.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256952905_61ef5d5ed8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The pandas are still cute, and in March there are almost no visitors.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256952855_2b96b649ca_h.jpg"/>
<p>
As in the Moscow Zoo, guests feed the animals, although it is written everywhere that this is prohibited.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255180357_8244e77990_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The second symbol of Beijing is smog. Beijing has the worst smog in the world. Without smog, Beijing would not be Beijing. I was lucky to see maximum smog on the first day. Even the entrance to the Forbidden City is not visible.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256952675_f0ae143750_h.jpg"/>

<p>
But it was not possible to visit the mausoleum; it was just closed for scheduled maintenance. Eh, sorry, Comrade Mao.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255909576_985c488484_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Foggy station.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256952355_1b0a789d0a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The smog is not so thick on all days. Here is the usual view of Beijing, of course, not particularly transparent, but still.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256953995_26fc93a1a0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Few people know that the truly forbidden city still exists and is located directly west of the museum. There are government buildings there and you can't go there. Here's the view from above.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256112393_20fb313e56_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In general, the personality cult of the head of state is thriving in China, which unites it with Russia and <a href="../washington">USA</a>. Any souvenir shop sells many portraits of Xi Jinping, a complete collection of plates with Chinese leaders, and so on.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256659889_658f40c2da_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And even in the local art museum, among socialist realism...
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255181382_736d21b6d5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And the avant-garde...
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255910936_23b87f4301_h.jpg"/>
<p>

Beijing is not a city where it’s pleasant to walk along beautiful, cozy streets or look at shining skyscrapers, but there are many different attractions here.
<p/>

<p>
The city is very large, and interesting places are located at a distance from each other, so you constantly need to travel. Until recently, the Beijing metro was the cheapest in China, since the fare was fixed and equal to two yuan (in other cities this is the cost of the shortest trip). But this was recently fixed, and now the Beijing metro is the most expensive, with tickets starting from three yuan. They haven’t had time to rebuild the system yet, which is why half of the stations don’t have ticket machines or they don’t work. You have to go to the ticket office and tell the cashier which station you need a ticket to. In addition, the metro is designed very strangely, many lines do not intersect with each other, because of this, you can travel a very short distance with two transfers. Therefore, it is often faster and cheaper to take a bus, which costs 2 yuan, and routes can be viewed on Baidu maps.
The Beijing Subway is the oldest in China, and it still has stations that are visually different from other Chinese subways built in the last 10 years.

Probably the most pleasant and relaxing place in Beijing is the Summer Imperial Palace.

There are quite a lot of people, but that’s not to say that there isn’t a lot of crowding. There is no need to come here during the New Year holidays.

The good thing about Beijing attractions is that they have inexpensive entrance by Chinese standards. Even the Forbidden City costs 40 yuan ($6.5), and the excellent park at the exit is less than a dollar.

In 2008, I was in Beijing for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Mind_Sports_Games">World Mind Sport Games</a>, living in the Olympic Village. A lot seems to have changed since then. It took me a while to find the hotel, but there was no supermarket around the corner.

Oddly enough, in communist China they fully respect the bourgeois revolution of 1911 and its leader Sun Yat-sen; in every city the main street is named after him (but for some reason there are no streets in honor of Mao Zedong). But the next leader, Chiang Kai-shek, is not revered at all here.

By the way, the Chinese have nothing against the number 666, but the number 444 is unlikely to be used as a bus number.

<h2>Taishan</h2>
<p>
There are different ways to climb Mount Taishan. The easiest and fastest way is to take a bus to the middle of the mountain (30 yuan or $5 one way), and from there take the cable car (100 yuan or $16 one way), then go down the same way. The entrance ticket costs another $20 or 120 yuan, so in total a speed visit to Taishan will cost a little more than $60. You can walk any of the sections for free. The part covered by the cable car takes about 2.5 hours (up and down faster), the part covered by the bus takes 5-6 hours. It would be strange to save on a bus in such a situation, if not for the fact that Taishan has sacred significance, and going up there on foot is an important pilgrimage for every Chinese. Therefore, both during the day and late at night, the stairs are full of people going up, even old people and small children. We decided to go even further and go up the mountain on the other side of the stairs, at the same time bypassing the ticket office. That's what came out of it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255804013_23819ce682_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It all starts simply: it’s a 20-minute walk from the city center to the entrance to the mountain. More precisely, to the nearest entrance from which buses run. There is a second entrance further away, from which the stairs for walking begin.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256347229_b0a3f215b6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
From the footpath you can turn up, there is a path that eventually goes down to the road anyway.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255597946_f50652aa12_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here is the bed of a river that dried up for the winter.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256347289_ad09ec806f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Before the bridge we turned off the path sharply up the slope. It is not difficult to climb there, and there is even some semblance of a path. However, after some time an obstacle arose.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255598021_a535646134_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Fortunately, it is quite possible for a thin person to slip between the two lower bars. But even if it is possible to climb over the top, it is very difficult.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255598086_1f0b5e6488_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Then a barely noticeable path goes through the forest and descends into a ravine. There are absolutely no people here, only sometimes buses drive along the road above the ravine (passenger cars are not allowed on that road). There were two gravestones in the ravine.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255803698_9fea215098_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the ravine there is a narrow bed of a dry river (it looks like the same one that looks much wider at the entrance), it is convenient to go up it up to a certain point.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255598166_3457df2574_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Suddenly the climb over the rocks in the riverbed becomes too steep. You need to go around the side, making your way through dry thorny bushes along the way. However, there is a path here too.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256347474_d0ef4f277d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At some point you emerge from the bushes onto a large rock rising above the forest. At this moment you realize that it was not in vain that you took such a roundabout and difficult route here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256644070_a25aaf731e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Then the bushes begin again.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255803848_22d8f705f8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And finally, the road! This road is clearly visible on satellite images on Baidu maps, which I used to navigate during the ascent. It runs parallel to the stairs. I thought it would be easy to get down to the stairs, but the slope on the side of the stairs is much steeper. We must move forward.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255803898_3a323acb74_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is what this road looks like, and below in the distance is the city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255598421_382ba411e5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You can get the idea from this photo. The summit of Taishan (the highest point) is visible in the distance. The road goes down and climbs up the next hill, and beyond that it is not visible. In reality, it turns into a path and goes along the next hill with a rocky top.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256347804_41e01b8a48_h.jpg"/>
<p>
View of the valley. On this side there is a road along which buses go, on the opposite side there are stairs.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256347844_067a28d4b5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Somewhere here I suddenly met a huntsman. For some reason he checked the passports and showed where to go next. A very narrow path ran along the cliff and eventually led to the top.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256644340_f501ac7871_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The path widens again and goes up the next hill. Apparently, it is used mainly by those who service towers with electrical wires. As you can see, the hill is fenced, but the gate is open. You don’t have to go up to the tower, but take another path around it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255804058_87e4d806f0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The path is something like this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257886490_3b276cb505_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Climbing up.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256116187_1557dba373_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here you can already hear the voices of people below on the stairs, but going down this slope directly seems too dangerous.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255804093_b7b6941382_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But you can continue moving along the slope along the path. Here civilization already reminds of itself with a pile of garbage.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255804108_387f021bda_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And finally, the path leads to the stairs! About five hours passed from the start of the ascent. About 30 minutes later there was already the middle gate, where the cable car begins. It would seem that the top is just a stone's throw away.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255598631_97d82eccff_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It turned out that climbing stairs is much more difficult than walking up a slope or even climbing rocks. The load is constantly placed on the same muscles with great frequency, which is why the legs quickly begin to fall off. What helps for a while is that you can step one or two steps, then different muscles tense up.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254869032_f7b7a5b658_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are many places on the stairs where you can sit and relax. All sorts of temples, gates, as well as shops.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255598661_83a5616918_h.jpg"/>

And here is the southern heavenly gate. I understand why they were called that. When you get here, you feel like you're in heaven. They say that whoever reaches the top on foot will live to be 100 years old.

Many of the rocks on Taishan are covered with long inscriptions describing the deeds of various emperors and how they ascended here. It is believed that at the top of Taishan, the first emperor Qin Shi Huang (the same one who built the Wall and the Terracotta Army) announced the unification of China into one country.
<p/>

<p>
I will remember the road down for a long time. Firstly, there is no lighting, meaning you have to go down the stairs in the dark. Two facts save me here: I still had a lot of charge left on my phone to illuminate it, and there are also a lot of people going up who also illuminate the road, some even use powerful flashlights attached to their helmets for this. Secondly, it turned out that the buses stop running around 8 pm, but I read in the guidebook that they also run at night. This meant having to walk all the way down the stairs. Only at first glance it seems that going down is easier, but in reality the muscles in the back of the legs have a different opinion on this matter. The descent took four hours, and at the very bottom there was a long-awaited taxi to the hotel. The whole next day we had to soak in the room, from where only hunger drove us out.
<p/>

I don’t regret for a second that I climbed Taishan on foot along a circuitous route. It’s more fun, there are more beautiful views, and the difficulty of climbing different mountains can then be assessed in millitaishan.
<p/>
<h2>Qufu</h2>
<p>
Once upon a time, the philosopher Confucius lived in Qufu. It’s unlikely that anything remains untouched from those times, but Qufu still has a pleasant and fairly quiet old center behind the fortress wall.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257720645_fe9c2b89e2_h.jpg"/>

Vegetable gardens are cultivated almost in the center of the city. Nearby, behind the wall, one of Qufu's attractions is a forest where many, many generations of Confucius' descendants are buried.
<p/>

<p/>

Qufu is not at all aimed at tourists from abroad. There are unusually few Latin signs in the city for China.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256879083_8c15497e1b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But there are many cheap and good hotels where there are no problems with check-in. This is what the area where I lived looked like, closer to the station than to the city center. By the way, for some reason Qufu is very low-rise, 20-story boxes are nowhere to be seen.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256878858_e9e0c69ef9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And the station here is not, as usual in China, the size of an airport, but the same size as in a small town.

<h2>Jinan</h2>
<p>
Jinan is the capital of Shandong Province, home to Qufu and Taishan, a large city with no major attractions. For me it was also a transit point, but why not take a walk around the city if you’re staying for the day?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257275205_7cf0fc6dfe_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Jinan is called the Spring city, and there are several related parks in the center. Two of them are literally opposite each other, while the entrance to one is somehow very expensive, and the second is very cheap, 5 yuan. The cheap park turned out to be very worthwhile.

In the middle, of course, is a huge pond where an unreal number of fish swim, hunting for free food.

<h2>Hengshui</h2>
<p>
In China, you can buy a train ticket without a seat if there are no seats left. I've already traveled like this on a high-speed train, it's not scary: there are few people without seats, you can sit in the vestibule on an upside-down bucket. But on regular trains there can be very, very many people without seats, so that all vestibules, toilets, and aisles are clogged. It’s uncomfortable to ride for more than a couple of hours in such conditions, to put it mildly, but the Chinese are able to ride standing or sitting on a folding chair all night long. I left Jinan by train Jinan-Urumqi (this is a city in the far west of China, it takes a couple of days to go there), and surprisingly, there were many passengers in the carriage who were going to sit in seats the whole way. There were even real Uyghurs (who looked like Uzbeks). I got off three hours later in the city of Hengshui to transfer five hours later to a reserved seat train to Pingyao.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256176706_84d4fcc136_h.jpg"/>

There is absolutely nothing to see in the city of Hengshui. It is an industrial regional center of Hebei province, surrounding Beijing. Let's see what a Chinese bumfuck looks like.

<p>
There was nothing else interesting in Hengshui except business cards of prostitutes glued to the asphalt. The appearance of two foreigners at the station attracted everyone's attention; we were escorted to the police VIP room, where a local security officer checked our passports and tickets. Unlike ordinary police officers, Chinese security officers from the PSB (Public Security Bureau) speak good English. We spent the remaining time before the train on soft, comfortable benches at the police department.

<h2>Pingyao</h2>
<p>
If you want to look at old authentic China, you should visit the city of Pingyao in Shanxi Province. It is located halfway between Beijing and Xian. Pingyao is endless pleasure from every house, every nook and cranny. The atmosphere is most similar to the Uzbek <a href="../uzbekistan">Bukhara</a> and the Russian <a href="../chechnya">Derbent</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257690865_686cb4eef4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The center of Pingyao is shaped like a square (as is customary in China) and is surrounded by a wall.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256647211_a04ac35858_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257690575_135dbfe759_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are two main streets: one runs from north to south, the other from west to east, and for some reason they intersect not in the very middle, but to the north-west of it. These streets, as usual in China, are densely lined with souvenir shops and inauthentic restaurants serving dishes that are exotic for the Chinese, such as pizza or burgers.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255919247_7e62a0fbb8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The signs fit well into the surrounding environment. This is an old ATM.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256647421_58936822e8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The variety of souvenirs is amazing. The entire assortment of this store is decks of playing cards. There is even a deck with photographs of Putin.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257691030_3fc85d2a84_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the center, some old buildings were turned into museums and turnstiles were installed.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257690640_e806cbdceb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But it’s not scary, because on any street, except for the two main ones, it’s so cool!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256081542_6637a8a4f3_h.jpg"/>

Costume performances are organized for tourists on the main street.

On the second day we decided to buy a ticket and walk around the local attractions. The ticket costs 120 yuan ($20) and is valid for three days, but if you call yourself a student, the price is halved. There are a lot of old houses, you can go to different ones in turn, so one ticket for two is almost enough.

The main thing worth buying a ticket to Pingyao for is the opportunity to visit the fortress wall. You can climb in several places, and I noticed that, in principle, there is one place in the southeast where it is easy to step over the turnstile, because it is not monitored. But when the street with bars is completed there, this opportunity will be closed.
<p/>

You can walk around the wall in a circle, which I did in about an hour and a half at a brisk pace. People concentrate in the vicinity of points where there is an entrance. Most of the wall is empty.

One yard for everyone.

And someone hasn’t had time to build a fence yet.
<p/>

<p>
Roofs are strengthened by simply laying bricks on top, as in the slums of <a href="../azerbaijan">Baku</a>.
<p/>

<p>
Some kind of closed area, similar to an abandoned factory.

Its continuation is outward.

<p>
The most shocking thing I realized while walking along the wall. It turns out that right opposite the entrance on the main street, where I walked many times, above the souvenir shops there is an inscription “Long live Chairman Mao!” I didn’t even notice it from below.
<p/>

<h2>Xian</h2>
<p>
Xian is probably the third most popular city among tourists in China after Beijing and Shanghai. People come here to see the Terracotta Army. Is it worth it?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255948938_9dbd854ec9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
From this angle in the photographs it looks gigantic, but when you actually go there, you realize that it is not that big, because the back rows are empty. It’s just that the platform in front is high, so you get such a perspective. The platform is lower on the side, giving a better view.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256495334_d068f5975a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here's another note for photographers - a good angle from behind.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255949108_6877feb6c1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In my opinion, this place is overrated, I can’t say that a visit to China would be incomplete without the Terracotta Army.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257606454_e28bcd6b64_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Maybe because the tickets are expensive - $25?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255746431_d75f4e58a1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Most of the soldiers were carefully restored from the wreckage. At the far end of the hall is the restorers' workshop.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255949048_855d181ed7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
New soldiers are preparing to go into the army.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255746481_5b93d4d2e2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The Chinese approach to restoration is somewhat different from the European one. If two fragments of a Greek vase are found during excavations in Europe, two fragments will be exhibited in the museum. The Chinese will glue them together, adding the missing parts. Initially, soldiers are in this state.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255746571_2d9dd2d3b8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Next to the main hall there are two more, where excavations have just begun.
<p/>

<p>
Of course, there is also a souvenir shop where you can buy a terracotta Mao Zedong.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255017282_8c0ac8ccc3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The territory of the three pits with soldiers is small, but the territory of the tourist complex around is gigantic, it is easy to get confused in it. There are free buses from the army to the emperor’s tomb, but I still didn’t understand where the stop was, so I ended up walking through some villages.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255017327_e7a5184990_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Along the way we came across a workshop where they make terracotta warriors.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255949203_7dd3623f98_h.jpg"/>
<p>
For some reason, the grandmother there was against taking photographs, which is rare for China.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256790670_108143235a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This hill looks like the emperor's grave. If this is so, then there should be a whole palace underground... but nothing has been excavated there yet. Let's wait!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256495569_0ba7d19287_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Tourists in Xian also traditionally visit the Muslim quarter. Xian is the border of the Muslim and Chinese worlds (the next province is Gansu, where the Wall ends).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255948688_2c898903d3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
They sell bread here the same as in Central Asia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255016757_92d8619c4d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And lamb kebabs on thick sticks.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256495009_1fffd664ff_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The sticks look cool in the trash.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255746001_bf089459b9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Oriental sweets are also prepared.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255746081_6d89c4a6e8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But in general this quarter is simply overcrowded with tourists.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256494859_5ccbe116b0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It seems that everything here consists of souvenir shops.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256790275_45449ec96d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
By the way, who needs life-size terracotta soldiers? How do you even transport them? Even if you live in China, you will be exhausted by train, not to mention the plane.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255745981_bd9f8c7fea_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The crowd thins out only on the side alleys.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256132417_10072504df_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But the real flavor is still there, although you have to look for it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255948818_3d6f5e2e92_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Also in the guidebook about Xian it will definitely be written about two pagodas, one larger, the other smaller. Where would we be without pagodas! Next to it is a large multi-level fountain that you can walk along.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256495814_979e62ca0a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the evening there is a music show there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255949903_fed9526ae4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It's really worth a look.

<p>
At first glance, it may seem that Xi'an is a city for a day, like small European old towns. Actually this is not true. Xi'an is a city with a population of millions, and its charm, like the charm of other Chinese megacities, lies not in a couple of pagodas, but in a million little things that catch your eye while you walk the streets here. Now I will show you what you can see here if you spend more than one day traveling from one attraction to another.

I like Chinese cities; at every step you can stumble upon something funny or strange. In Europe, in most cities, everything is quite predictable: beautiful, houses in the Baroque style, pavement, funny sculptures in the corners, outdoor cafes (the food in all countries in such places is the same, except for the most expensive Michelin-starred restaurants). No matter how much you walk around <a href="../croatia">Dubrovnik</a>, you won’t see anything unusual. But in China there is freedom. For example, here, in my humble opinion, is my most successful photo from Xian: a girl in an orange coat seems to say: “Selfie? DO NOT WANT!”
<p/>

For some reason, many people try not to include other people in their photographs, but it can be much more interesting with people than without them. Where else can you see the latest hipster fashion if not near landmarks?

Let's go for a walk around the city. At first glance, Xian is a dusty, foggy city with very wide streets and gray high-rise buildings.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255745811_2e24eec84b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Especially if you walk along the main streets.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255745926_c2d9a9632a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Although even on polluted highways the Chinese manage to plant trees between the lanes.
<p/>

<p>
In China, there are sometimes huge circular overpasses at large intersections.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256790860_02fd9b7856_h.jpg"/>
<p>
From here it is easy to observe how chaotic the movement is.
<p/>

<p>
But this is not all of Xian. I lived in a workers' and peasants' area, where there were cheap hotels, canteens and barbecues on the street.
<p/>

These small buses travel through residential areas with narrow streets. On the glass it is written that travel by card costs 1 yuan, in cash - 2 yuan.
<p/>

<p>
Chinese residential areas are full of five-story buildings. I called them "Zedong houses", just like Khrushchev houses in the USSR. To make it less scary with the bars on each window, they can draw something on the shades. For example, "Welcome to Huiling, friends."
<p/>
