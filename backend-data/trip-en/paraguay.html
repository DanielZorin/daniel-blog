<h1>Paraguay: Encarnacion, Trinidad, Hohenau, Asuncion, Ciudad del Este</h1>
<i>12-16 января 2013</i>
<h2>Encarnacion</h2>
<p>
At the Paraguayan border, all non-Paraguayan citizens disembark from the bus and go to the border guard booth. Argentines simply give their ID card and receive a small piece of paper with it; foreigners get their passport stamped. In this case, there is no physical cordon; you can simply stay on the bus or stand at the border control and take the next bus, having entered illegally.
The bus from the border was so packed that I had to ride next to the driver, holding onto the windshield. That's what you are like, the least visited country in South America!

<p>
In Encarnacion, I spent a lot of time looking for a hotel and ended up checking into the most expensive one. It was Saturday, and crowds of Paraguayans had come to lounge on the beach along the Parana River.

<p>
In Paraguay, all street signs include advertisements.
<p/>

<p>
The city is being actively rebuilt. On the southern outskirts there is a market, but a significant part of it has already been demolished, and the site is being leveled for skyscrapers.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255359587_d73056d5cd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In these slums, the streets don't even have names.
<p/>

<p>
In the meantime, Posadas on the other side of the river looks almost like New York.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256089471_1b1fd13790_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Houses are often painted in bright colors.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256289428_9272443380_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are many paintings on the walls, mainly commemorating the recent bicentenary of independence.

<p>
The monument to the heroes of the Chaco War (1932-1935) is decorated.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256837524_e211556d37_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are still strange monuments around. Wheel.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256837494_4c342cd2cd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There seems to be something similar in the capital of Brazil.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255359542_5a357c3890_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You cannot enter this building. Looks like an abandoned warehouse.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256837649_e493c1bc8c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But on the reverse side a cross is drawn. Maybe this is a temple?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255359632_8b33addb86_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the central square there is a park dedicated to emigrants from different countries who settled in Paraguay.

<p>
Encarnacion is the third city of Paraguay, the population is more than 100 thousand, but the entire city can be walked on foot from south to north. I reached the northern edge, but there was nothing interesting there.

<h2>Hohenau</h2>
<p>
Buses in Paraguay are a real attraction, both urban and intercity. Theoretically, a couple of companies have websites, but most are not represented on the Internet. In Encarnacion, at the bus station, vendors hang out with notepads that look like checkbooks. You can buy a ticket from them, then they will write where you are going to on the form and give it to you. Everyone seems to represent their bus company as they show which bus to take if there are several on the same route. You can also buy a ticket at the box office, I managed to do this for a trip to the village of Hohenau, and when I tried to buy a ticket to Asuncion at the box office, the cashier called a man with a book and he wrote out a ticket. I actually got from Trinidad to Encarnacion by hitchhiking, since they didn’t collect money either at the entrance or exit of the bus.
I was unlucky, and every time I ended up on a bus that made a bunch of stops in different villages. Most passengers got on and off along the way, many riding standing. There are also people constantly stopping by offering refreshments and local specialty buns called "chipa".

<p>
In Paraguay, the earth is red, which is why on the country roads you feel like you are on Mars.
<p/>

<p>
This is a cobbled street in the village of Hohenau, famous for the fact that Dr. Mengele hid here for some time.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256382993_47acdc218e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The main street is a highway.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256184001_29040cae3d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The houses are quite decent.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255454132_4b90b56854_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are no rickety shacks.
<p/>

Bar "Lion".
<p/>

<p>
The streets have names.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257227005_92659570a0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are cows grazing everywhere
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255454287_e47bb58d60_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I must say that the roads in Paraguay are of quite good quality.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257227155_9191022cb5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I set off on foot in the direction of the neighboring village of Trinidad.
<p/>

<h2>Trinidad</h2>
<p>
When the earth is not visible, the landscape is not Martian at all.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254927347_dd93eca679_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Pasture.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256702375_8ac41a2a14_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Houses and shops appear.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254927442_a319f89a44_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Trinidad is famous primarily for the ruins of a Jesuit monastery, the only UNESCO World Heritage Site in Paraguay.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255656861_bdd2afdbfb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
From most buildings, only a portion of the walls and foundation remain.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255861523_aa765aff12_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At night the ruins are illuminated.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254927697_f1b408ee12_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Some buildings display preserved pieces of bas-reliefs
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254927637_3c508e6742_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The road to the ruins is lined with small pedestals with images like this.

<p>
The place is interesting and worth spending a few hours here. You can have a picnic on the lawn.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255861443_3e2d4df9f3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A big problem in Paraguay is a disease called dengue fever. It is spread by mosquitoes, so the ad reminds to empty stagnant water from barrels and buckets so that mosquito larvae do not live there. When I was in Paraguay, there was another outbreak of this disease, so out of caution, I constantly smeared myself with repellent, although in the cities I didn’t even see mosquitoes, in Russia it seems like there are many more of them.
<p/>

<h2>Asuncion</h2>
<p>
From the series “What guidebooks don’t tell you”: in Paraguay everyone drinks Coca-Cola through a straw, including from cans and bottles. If you buy a large bottle, you will be given two straws to insert one into the other.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256038498_29bd8f57d4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The main attraction of the capital of Paraguay is undoubtedly the buses. As in Brazil, they must be stopped by signaling with your hand.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255836916_18914af59a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But, unlike Brazil, there are virtually no stops. You can stop the bus anywhere.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256038763_a935c0854f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Some buses are straight museum pieces.

<p>
Unlike Brazil, you get a paper ticket similar to tickets from buses in Russian provincial cities. The driver must have a cup of mate.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256039643_0909a8efe9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Chip traders also board city buses, naturally, without paying the fare.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256039703_3b6553a9ca_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A rare occurrence is a list of routes. The numbering is a complete mess. For example, buses 9-1 and 9-2 take completely different routes.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255837681_a67c40699f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
People are waiting for the bus outside my hotel. By the way, about hotels. Hotels in Paraguay are quite cheap, $20-30 per day, and they have Wi-Fi. In the Asuncion hotel I observed an antique way of using credit cards. Using a special press, the number and name embossed on my card were printed on the check along with the hotel account number, and then the receptionist called the bank on the phone and dictated the credit card number with the CVC code and the amount to be debited.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256586534_5c02363383_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Many antiques can be seen in the Paraguayan Railway Museum, located in the former station building. Railroads in Paraguay appeared in the mid-19th century, even before the war of 1864 (so South America was not lagging behind in technology much). At the entrance you will be given the same ticket as at this box office.
<p/>

"It is prohibited to ride on the platforms at the rear of the carriages"
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255107937_2237bcd2e6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You can see and touch an ancient elite carriage with individual compartments.
<p/>

<p>
The toilets in the 19th century were the same as they are now in unrenovated Russian Railways trains.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255837561_cdce18bef4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But there are no such washbasins now.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256880845_80cd09fd6c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Another very interesting place in Asuncion is the national Pantheon.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256584979_f6a48ce8c2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Famous military leaders are buried here, and in the middle is the tomb of the unknown soldier.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256585684_23a94b8780_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Among others, Francisco Solano Lopez, the Paraguayan Hitler, the insane dictator who started a war with Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, is buried here as a hero. Because of the war, the country was completely destroyed, became the poorest in South America, lost two-thirds of its territory and up to 90% of the male population. The war ended only when Solano Lopez was smoked out of the forests where he leed guerrilla and killed.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256038988_eda6e4534d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are many memorial plaques in the Pantheon in honor of various wars, including this one. Russian emigrants appeared in Paraguay after the defeat of the whites in the civil war. Some helped Paraguay win the difficult war with Bolivia in 1932-1935.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256585799_fa79e79206_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In Asuncion there is also a monument to Francisco Solano Lopez on horseback.
<p/>

<p>
It rises above the only slum in the city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256880595_47c095efc4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The slums are actually located right behind the presidential palace.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256880695_3136c92a88_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But from the parliament building, located on the same street a little further, the slums have already been removed.
<p/>

<p>
By the way, about Hitler. Adolf is very popular here; you can buy his works in bookstores.

<p>
Recently, the president was impeached in Paraguay for harshly suppressing a peasant uprising in a certain province. Now the walls are full of inscriptions: “Franco is a fascist and usurper! Lugo, the people are with you!”
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256880745_b16b863720_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Unlike Argentina, Paraguay does not allow same-sex marriage. The writing on the wall invites all sodomites to proceed in the direction of Argentina.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256880195_b0893a2367_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Information signs were hung in the city center.

Let's take a walk through the streets.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256584739_d129915fe3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In Paraguay they like to sell cola from huge containers in the shape of a cola bottle.

<p>
The streets are dirty in places.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255107247_4f7b5b9899_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Near the center there is a huge market.

Let's take a look into the residential area.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255108427_f8ad3b6ba6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It's a lot of fun to ride a bus through this area as it bounces on the cobblestones that make up the pavement.

<h2>Ciudad del Este</h2>
<p>
Martian landscape.

<p>
Democracy came to Paraguay quite recently after almost 200 years of dictatorship; they haven’t played enough with elections yet. There are posters everywhere advertising different candidates for all local elections.
<p/>

<p>
Ciudad del Este is a huge market, where Brazilians and Argentines come for cheap goods. There's not much to see here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255296642_a8665c5305_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Promotion of bus companies is prohibited at the bus station, and there are no people with checkbooks here. But when I asked at the information desk where to change money, I was directed to a man sitting on a bench, and I gave him the remaining Paraguayan guarani in exchange for Brazilian reals.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256026671_d17546df6f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The slums right around the station are as miserable as possible; people don’t even make walls out of cardboard, but live right in cellophane huts.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257070215_6f08f75c8a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I was the only passenger on the bus to the Brazilian border. A few kilometers from the border “Friendship Bridge” the bus got into a huge traffic jam of buses, the driver gave me a piece of paper and advised me to walk to the beginning of the traffic jam and take the first bus. After that, I still spent a lot of time stuck in traffic. The fastest way to cross the border is on a motorcycle. You can also walk, but it’s a long walk to the bridge itself, and you can get there through traffic jams, again, only by motorcycle. Neither Paraguayans nor Brazilians check documents at the border. On the Brazilian side there was only a small customs check of people with large bags of things. I still don’t have a Paraguayan exit stamp, but to get a Brazilian one I had to walk from the bus stop back to the border.
