<h1>Russia: Moscow</h1>
<i>4 March 1990 - 28 February 2015</i>
<h2>Moscow</h2>
<p>
Having seen enough monuments to Lenin during my numerous travels around Russia, I thought that I could look for them in Moscow. In the end, this turned out to be a great way to see various unusual places outside the city center where I simply would not have gone otherwise, and I adopted this technique for other cities. More monuments to Lenin were erected in Moscow than anywhere else, <a href="http://leninstatues.ru/moscow">in the catalog</a> there are about a hundred. Many of them, however, are difficult to access, as they are located in closed areas, but about 60 can be seen in public places. The search for the Lenins slowly continued from 2014 to 2020.
Let's start with the most central ones. There are few monuments to Lenin within the Garden Ring. There are only three on the streets. The main one (and, probably, the main monument to Lenin in Moscow) stands on Kaluzhskaya Square near the Oktyabrskaya metro station.
<p/>

<p>
Since we are on Oktyabrskaya, we can immediately go to Muzeon Park, opposite Gorky Park. In English guidebooks it is called Park of Fallen Monuments; many old Soviet sculptures are collected there.

There, in one corner, there are six monuments to Lenin: a black bust.

Gorky Park had not yet been transformed under Sobyanin; Pyatnitskaya Street, which I remember well as a car street, had just been reconstructed.

Bakery "Daily Bread" still has no spelling error in the name - later they put ѣ instead of e in the word "хлеб", but forgot the hard sign Ъ at the end.

<p>
The most central Lenin in Moscow is located directly opposite the City Hall, behind the monument to Yuri Dolgoruky. But he is not tall, and he also sits, so it is not noticeable from afar.
<p/>

<p>
The third monument in the center stands near the Chistye Prudy metro station in the side streets. This is a monument to the young Lenin - a student.

The creators of the sign confused the Ъ letter and the ѣ. The letter ѣ (yat) existed until the reform of 1918, it was pronounced as [e], by the 19th century the difference in pronunciation between ѣ and e disappeared so using this letter became obsolete. The letter Ъ ("hard sign") is not pronounced. Before the reform, this letter was written at the end of all words ending with a consonant, so it was very common. Now this letter is rarely used.

In Moscow, the vast majority of people associate districts with metro stations. When you need to give a reference point, the nearest metro is the number one choice. It happens that some areas are nearby, but since they are on different metro lines, they are perceived as distant. If you start going on long walks, after a while you begin to perceive the location of various places differently, you can already mentally imagine a map. A separate unusual way to look at the city is from the water, here the distance is felt completely differently. There is no river transport in Moscow, only recreational transport, so I think that the vast majority of Muscovites have never seen the city from the water.
