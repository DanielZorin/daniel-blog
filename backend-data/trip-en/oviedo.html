<h1>Spain: Madrid, Valladolid, Leon, Oviedo, Gijon, Aviles</h1>
<i>4-6 December 2023</i>
<h2>Madrid</h2>
<p>
One of the countries I missed the most in Europe is, of course, Spain. I decided to go there one more time, and laid out the route exactly through those provinces where I had never been before, that is, mainly in the north. First I flew to Madrid. This is probably the most pleasant capital in all of Western Europe, there aren't too many tourists and migrants, it is clean, tidy, inexpensive. I can definitely recommend Madrid more than Barcelona.

Travel to the airport has risen in price from 5 euros to 7.50 (like almost everything in Europe over the past 3 years).

I bought a European SIM card from the Orange operator, which is relatively easy to maintain active. You can buy a SIM card from a machine by scanning your passport. For 20 euros I got a new SIM card and as much as 100 gigabytes.

<h2>Valladolid</h2>
<p>
From Madrid I traveled north through the province of Castile and Leon. Spain emerged as a united state at the end of the 15th century, with the unification of Castile and Aragon. Aragon then included not only the current province of <a href="../bilbao">Aragon</a>, but also the coastal regions of Barcelona and Valencia, where Catalan is spoken. The Spanish language comes from Castile. To the west, in the Leon region, there are already Asturian-Leonese languages/dialects, and even further west, Portuguese and <a href="../galicia">Galician</a>.

The north of Spain is characterized by wooden balconies that span the entire height of the building. They look a little different in every city.

<h2>Leon</h2>
<p>
Leon is a large city at the crossroads of roads leading to the northwestern regions of Spain. There's also another Leon in Nicaragua, where <a href="../nicaragua">I was a couple of years ago</a>, which is also quite interesting.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53399880985_4f4ae85396_o.jpg" >
<p>
Leon is very lively in the evening. There are a lot of typical Spanish bars in the center, and they were all packed; it was not without difficulty that I found where to have dinner. León's eateries are not really about dining, even less so than the usual tapas bars in other cities in Spain. The peculiarity of Leon is that there are bars where they serve tapas for free, you only have to pay for alcohol. But in such places the choice of tapas is extremely modest.
<p/>

<h2>Oviedo</h2>
<p>
Asturias is a hilly region in the north of Spain. This is the only part of Spain that was not fully conquered by the Arabs in the 7th and 8th centuries, and this is where the Reconquista began. The road from Castile to Asturias is very picturesque, the train descends from the plateau along a winding mountain road. A slow train is better than a fast train.
