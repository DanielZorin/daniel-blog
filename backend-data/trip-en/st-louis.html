<h1>USA: St. Louis, Minneapolis, Salt Lake City</h1>
<i>30 May - 2 June 2018</i>
<h2>St. Louis</h2>
<p>
St. Louis is an American city with a sad fate. The Olympic Games were held here in 1904. Why did they decide to spend them in such a hole, and not in New York or Los Angeles? It’s just that in 1904, St. Louis was not a hole, but the fourth largest city in the United States, and now it is 64th, and its population is two and a half times less than a hundred years ago. The St. Louis suburb of Ferguson was negatively noted for riots in 2014, and another suburb of East St. Louis recently topped the ranking of the most crime-ridden cities in the United States, knocking off <a href="http://goo.gl/Chw8dw">Camden, New Jersey</a>.

I thought that this arch had been here since the 19th century, but no, it was built in 1965.

It symbolizes the conventional border of the east and west of the United States - once St. Louis was the farthest city, beyond which unexplored territories and the wild west began.

There is an elevator inside that you can take to the top.

The arch stands on the banks of the Mississippi, the largest river in the United States, which I had previously seen at its mouth in <a href="http://goo.gl/whW8kw">New Orleans</a>.

St. Louis is built on a grid, and there are two main streets exactly behind the arch.

The monument to Dred Scott and his wife near the courthouse. As a result of their trial the US Supreme Court ruled that slaves and their descendants did not have the right to US citizenship, which was one of the reasons for the Civil War. This is now considered the worst court decision in American history.

In St. Louis, I took a tour of a brewery.

<p>
The most popular American beer, Bud, is produced here. The plant was founded by German settlers Anheuser and Busch back in the 19th century. It was originally short for Budweiser (that is, beer from the city of Ceske Budejovice, which is called Budweis in German), but for English speakers it turned out to be too long, so the name was shortened.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256312609_4d71d24aa3_o.jpg">
<p>
The plant was built back in the days when factories were built to look like palace buildings.

The interior is also chic inside, at least in those rooms shown to the tourists.

In St. Louis I lived as close as possible to the ideal of “one-story America.” 20 kilometers from the center, the area is only with private houses. In other cities, I usually lived closer to the city center, or in a motel on the highway.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256311339_7db89d16ec_o.jpg">

The area is called Belle Nord.

On the first day, I arrived late in the evening and spent the second half of the day walking around this area, at the same time stopping at the supermarket, which was a 20-25 minute walk from the house.
<p/>

The houses here are not all the same, there are more substantial brick ones, and obviously cheaper ones made of some material similar to white boards.

<p>
How did I survive in this area without a car? There was a metro station (light rail) 15 minutes from the house. Yes, there are many other areas like this in St. Louis where there is no metro, but I chose this one based on the proximity to the metro.

St. Louis has two subway lines that merge into one in the center and run across the Mississippi to East St. Louis, which is technically even in another state.

I came here for a reason, because there is a place called Cahokia Mounds - by the way, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

According to archaeologists, it was a fairly large city by the standards of pre-Columbian North America (which was then much less populated than the central one with the Aztec and Mayan empires).

<h2>Minneapolis</h2>
<p>
In Minneapolis (Minnesota), I had a layover at the airport for about 6 hours, during which time I managed to go to the city center, fortunately it's not far. Few people outside the United States have heard about this city, although it is quite large - the agglomeration has more than 3 million people.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256443146_657f0ff10b_o.jpg">
<p>
From the airport to the center you can take a light rail, the lines of which cover Minneapolis and the neighboring city of St. Paul, the capital of Minnesota.

<h2>Salt Lake City</h2>
<p>
Salt Lake City is the capital of Utah, famous for its national parks and the fact that Mormons live here. Mormons are followers of a heterodox Christian church founded in America in the 19th century. The 2002 Olympic Games were also held here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255426761_a6a348b5a9_o.jpg">
<p>
The main attraction of the city is the Mormon Temple. I remember as a child I saw photographs of it in a book about world landmarks, and they were all from approximately the same angle as the photo above; it seemed that this temple was simply gigantic, but in life it turned out to be quite compact.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255630563_fbce56f742_o.jpg">

Non-Mormons are not allowed in, just as non-Muslims are not allowed into the mosque in Mecca.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255630528_b3ce04baa8_o.jpg">
<p>
Unlike most Christian churches (especially Gothic ones), this temple is almost symmetrical; at first glance, from the back it has the same façade, only the central tower is higher.
