<h1>Honduras: Tegucigalpa, Comayagua, San Pedro Sula</h1>
<i>25-27 October 2021</i>
<h2>Border</h2>
<p>
Honduras, Honduras, in the heart of each of us. The name of the country has become a kind of meme in Russian language, but in general Honduras does not stand out that much among other countries in the region - in crime it is lower than El Salvador, in poverty it is lower than Nicaragua. The country lags somewhat behind in terms of tourism, because backpackers often transit through it without stopping (the direct road from Guatemala to Nicaragua/Costa Rica passes along the southern edge of Honduras, past the capital). Tourism is concentrated on the island of Roatan off the Caribbean coast, which is separated from the rest of Honduras - cruise ships call there and it has its own airport. I never found direct buses, so I crossed the border both at the entry and exit on foot, taking a chicken bus to the border crossing. The border with El Salvador is called El Amatillo.

Honduras welcomes you.

<p>
It immediately catches your eye - it’s very dirty compared even to El Salvador.

<p>
The bottles have been lying around for so long that they are already compacted and dusty, reminiscent of Myanmar or India.

The first landscapes of Honduras. It is hilly, but unlike El Salvador there are no volcanoes.

In Honduras, like in Belize, there are many Chinese, and you can often find Chinese restaurants.

<p>
Tegucigalpa Airport. Because it's in the mountains, it's harder for larger planes to land here, so more flights fly to the second-largest city of San Pedro Sula in the north.
<p/>

The airport is very civilized.

<p>
And there is a queue of trucks for several kilometers, occupying the entire exit lane, so that buses and minibuses in both directions pass in the left lane. I spent four hours on this border, but this is already about Nicaragua.

<h2>Tegucigalpa</h2>
<p>
Tegucigalpa is the capital of Honduras, a city of a million people in the mountains. This city is not as terrible as I imagined: as it turned out, there are quite decent areas, and not only with villas behind high walls. And it even has its own small skyline, unlike most other capitals in this region.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51734868757_e14dc24168_h.jpg"/>

<p>
Buses come to the poor part across the river, which is technically a separate city called Comayagüela.
<p/>

<p>
Somewhere around here I got out and hailed a taxi, since Uber cars don’t hang out in this area, it was a long wait.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51736581985_7a903fcaa9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I needed to take a coronavirus test to enter Nicaragua, and the most convenient way to do this is in the capital, there are several options, one of which was not even super expensive, but just expensive ($80). The lab was in a good area, but it turned out that Covid tests were taken at another department in the same part of the city, but several kilometers away, so I had to take an Uber, but in the end I made it before the end of working hours.

The shopping center, as you can see, there are brands familiar to us here.
<p/>

This is the historical center - not the most prosperous area, where it is definitely better not to walk on the streets after dark.

After checking into the hotel, the first thing I did was walk along the winding streets up to the park with panoramic views.

In terms of relief, this is the most picturesque large city in Central America; it could be very pleasant and interesting for tourists if it were not so dangerous here.
<p/>

There are often advertisements on the streets promising a $200 fine for littering. In general, the main streets in the center are not dirty.

<p>
By the way, about the shops. In Honduras, at the entrance to any store larger than one room, there will be storage boxes, and annoying security guards force you to put EVERYTHING there, even my micro-backpack or camera bag. This really pissed me out, so after being bumped a couple of times, I stopped going into stores.

Honduran taxis are ordinary taxis, super old rusty cars. Uber has new spacious cars with air conditioning, and cheaper, although there are few cars, since they appeared in the city recently.

<h2>Comayagua</h2>
<p>
Comayagua is the historical capital of Honduras (until 1849). Now it is a medium-sized city, not particularly dangerous compared to the capital, and colonial architecture has been more or less preserved.
<p/>

<p>
The difference is that there were almost no tourists here even before the coronavirus, so there are a few cafes only in the central square.

<h2>San Pedro Sula</h2>
<p>
After Comayagua, I went to San Pedro Sula, a city famous for having the highest murder rate in the world in the first half of the 2010s, until Caracas took the lead. In 2019, according to Wikipedia, San Pedro Sula fell back to 15th place, however, it is still the most dangerous city in Central America without taking into account <a href="../mexico">Mexico</a> (which seems to be experiencing a crime wave right now).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51735697056_3a08a94f43_h.jpg"/>

<p>
The main road of Honduras is of good quality, even on a cheap public bus I got there faster than I expected.

There are quite a few restaurants with verandas and picnic areas along the shore, it seems that locals like to come here to chill.

From time to time, sellers enter the bus; the most popular product is sachets of water that you can to drink after biting from the corner.

The San Pedro Sula bus station is located at the exit of the city near the ring road. The station is quite new and colossal in size.

This is a very rare case in Central America for a large city to have a bus station where all the bus companies are gathered, although, unfortunately, it did not reach the idea of a  general ticket office, each company has its own ticket office.

I traveled back with the most expensive company, and the bus was extremely disappointing. It looks like it's only expensive because it closed half of its seats due to the corona virus.

I took a taxi and drove to the central square. I didn’t take any photographs along the way, but the views of the outskirts of the city (at least from the south side) were a pleasant surprise - I expected solid favelas and trash, but there were many new shopping centers and decent cars. There is a city hall in the central square.
