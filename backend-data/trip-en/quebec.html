<h1>Canada: Montreal, Quebec</h1>
<i>20-22 May 2018</i>
<h2>Montreal</h2>
<p>
My acquaintance with the second largest country in the world began in Quebec, a region where French is spoken. French colonies in Canada appeared in the 16th century and were taken over by the British after the Seven Years' War in the mid-18th century, however, Quebecers managed to preserve their language even after 250 years. Unlike <a href="http://goo.gl/whW8kw">Louisiana</a>, whose population in the United States was a clear minority and was practically assimilated into the English-speaking environment, in sparsely populated Canada they made up a significant proportion of the population. And today, most people here speak French, and the signs are not even all in English.

<p>
We are approaching the shores of Canada. The Gulf of St. Lawrence gradually becomes the St. Lawrence River.

Where the river turns into a bay, stands the city of Quebec, which I will return to a little later.

Again the river and Montreal - the largest city in the region.

Right in the center is Mount Royal, after which the city is named.

Montreal is located on a fairly large island in the middle of the river.
<p/>

I rented a room in the hipster area of ​​Plateau Mont-Royal at the bottom of the hill.

<p>
Accommodation in Montreal is cheap, there are a lot of options on Airbnb from $20, and hotels are not that expensive. This is not America, this is Europe.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257491930_5cc6697f26_o.jpg">
<p>
The area consists of low-rise narrow houses. In many, the stairs are taken outside.

Now let's go to the historical center. It's like this, a little bit French.

<p>
But as soon as you walk away two blocks, North America is immediately visible - a square vacant lot with a parking lot and the bare end of the building. There are also fire escapes on the side, like in New York.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256449336_2252c42f2c_o.jpg">

The streets are all at right angles, but the signature Parisian color is maintained well.

Getting around Montreal is quite convenient thanks to four metro lines. The fare is $3.50, or $10 per day. The stations look quite stylish in some places.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257491850_b44a6d4771_o.jpg">
<p>
It is curious that Montreal carriages run on rubber wheels. Such cars are most often used in the world for small systems, such as trains connecting terminals at an airport (for example in Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur and San Francisco), but there are also large systems, in particular, almost all metro systems in France, including part of the Paris metro, as well as the metro in Mexico City.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257197019_4c447994dd_o.jpg">
<p>
The station is a reference to the Parisian metro.

Montreal's Central Station looks like a box from the outside, with other buildings built on top of it.

<p>
Tickets are checked before entering the platform, as in China, so it’s not easy to get beyond the main hall.

The business center begins behind the old town; it is quite similar to cities in North America.

Downtown is quite deserted, apparently due to the fact that here entertainment activity is clearly concentrated in the historical center, and not in the downtown, as for example in Toronto.

<h2>Quebec</h2>
<p>
The capital of Quebec is called Québec. It is interesting that in English the province and the city are spelled differently - the city is written Québec with an accent mark, as in French (and in speech they simply say Quebec City). In French, they are distinguished by the presence of an article with the name of the province (but not with the name of the city). It may be the most "European" city north of Mexico.

Why would there be a castle in Canada if there was no nobility here? It's just that this building was originally built as a hotel in the late 19th century.
