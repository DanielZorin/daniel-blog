<h1>Russia: Arkhangelsk, Severodvinsk</h1>
<i>22-24 January 2015</i>
<h2>Arkhangelsk</h2>
<p>
Everyone knows about the leaning tower in Italy, but few people know that in Russia there is a whole city of leaning houses: Arkhangelsk.

<p>
Almost all the wooden houses that remained in Arkhangelsk began to dance.

<p>
No, these are not abandoned buildings. People live there. Perhaps the fact that the floor tilts is not so scary.
<p/>

People live in <a href="../netherlands">Rotterdam</a> in houses with sloping walls.

<p>
It's like Alice in Wonderland.

<p>
Arkhangelsk can be awarded a prize for the most unusual and memorable coat of arms of the city. Only <a href="../vologda">Vologda</a> can compete with it, where the coat of arms depicts a hand protruding from a cloud.

<p>
Arkhangelsk is known to the broad masses thanks to the monument to Peter I, which is depicted on the 500 ruble banknote.
<p/>

<p>
What this monument is doing in Arkhangelsk is completely unclear. No one inflicted greater damage on the city than Peter I, who banned all trade through Arkhangelsk, destroying its economy. Before Peter I, this was Russia’s only access to the sea and its main port.
<p/>

<p>
Arkhangelsk is not located on the sea, but at the mouth of the Northern Dvina River.
<p/>

<p>
Half of the street remains with historical buildings.

Well-preserved wooden houses were moved to the pedestrian street.

The building at the end of the main street is a local Soviet skyscraper.

Most of the city is built up with commieblocks.

<p>
Suddenly, there is a tourist information center in Arkhangelsk, although it was closed. I wonder if there are many tourists in Arkhangelsk? It takes almost a whole day to travel from Moscow by train, and there is a dead end here; then you can only go back, except for the option of a cruise through the Solovetsky Islands towards Karelia.
<p/>

<p>
There is a lot to see here though. For example, in a village near Arkhangelsk they collected wooden churches, houses and mills from all over the region (historically it was called Pomorie). There is a similar museum in <a href="../karelia">Kizhi</a>.

It's nice to walk around this museum in winter!

In general, it’s pleasant here in winter, there’s a lot of snow, no dirt is visible.

A characteristic feature of Arkhangelsk is that local public transport is represented almost exclusively by PAZ buses. I have never seen so many anywhere else.

<p>
Lomonosov was born 100 kilometers south of Arkhangelsk, so the local university bears his name, and there is also a monument.

Someone expressed his opinion on the most pressing issue on the pedestal of the monument: "Obama is a dick".

<p>
Well, I decided to add my own inscription that suits the style.

<h2>Severodvinsk</h2>
<p>
Theoretically, Severodvinsk is a semi-closed city where foreigners are prohibited from entering, but no one checked my documents. The main factory where submarines are made is located here.

As a child, I lived on Severodvinskaya Street, so I couldn’t help but stop by this city, fortunately it’s just a stone’s throw from Arkhangelsk. There are no special attractions in Severodvinsk, but the city is pleasant, because... it was built during the time of Stalin, and not during the time of Khrushchev. There are no pre-revolutionary wooden houses, because Severodvinsk became a city in the 1930s, before that there was only a monastery, which is now on the territory of one of the factories.

Streets and squares are not just "Lenin square", but "Square in the name of Lenin". Why in some cities they write this way is a mystery.

A miraculously preserved sign (I saw a similar one in <a href="../kostroma">Kostroma</a>).

Modern houses. The main distinguishing feature is the roof with a ridge. In all Khrushchev buildings it is flat.

Suddenly, just before leaving, I discovered a school bus in Severodvinsk, just like in America! And also yellow.
