<h1>Russia: Saint Petersburg</h1>
<i>15-18 February 2021</i>
<h2>Saint Petersburg</h2>
<p>
Somehow, during so much time in St. Petersburg, I have never wandered onto the islands in the northern part of the Petrogradsky district. It's time to correct this mistake. These islands were a place for dachas for rich people in the 19th century (as the city grew, dachas moved further north to Sestroretsk and further to the Ozero cooperative <i>Cooperative of Putin and his friends in the 90's</i>). The closest metro station to Kamenny (Stone) Island is Chernaya Rechka. Lakhta Center is visible in the distance.

Kamenny Island still looks like a dacha - large mansions behind fences, when there are dense residential areas on both the north and south.

I walked across the pedestrian bridge to Elagin Island. This entire island is occupied by the Central Park of Culture and Rest. On weekends you even need to buy a ticket at the entrance (you can only get there via three bridges).

Krestovsky Ostrov metro station. At the far end of the island there is the Zenit Arena stadium, and a metro station. Since my last visit it was renamed from Novokrestovskaya to Zenit, but was never opened (as I understand, due to the coronavirus epidemic, it was closed in April 2020, since the station essentially serves only the stadium, and there are no residential buildings in its vicinity).

I've been to Pulkovo airport five times on arrival, and finally for the first time I looked at it from the departure side (before that I always traveled to Moscow by train). The architecture is a bit reminiscent of Bangkok BKK Airport.

What's good about St. Petersburg in winter is its very cheap hotels. You can live in a very good hotel five minutes from Gostiny Dvor for 1000 rubles a day; in the summer this costs 2500-3000.

<h2>Lomonosov</h2>

The city of Lomonosov (formerly Oranienbaum) is the farthest piece of St. Petersburg on the southern side of the Gulf of Finland. Administratively, Lomonosov belongs to the Petrodvortsovy district, like neighboring Peterhof.
