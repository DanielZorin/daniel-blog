<h2>Macau</h2>
<p>
I was in Macau <a href="http://goo.gl/SV5h99">in 2013</a>, but a lot of time has passed since then, and I myself have become wiser and more experienced. Back the, in fact, I spent more time, but visited fewer places than in 2019, when I traveled from Hong Kong one day without an overnight stay. First of all, I went to the southern part of Macau to Taipa Island, where I had not been at all in 2013.

Taipa is a residential area compared to the center of Macau. There are houses similar to those in Hong Kong, but a little less high-rise.

There is a small historical area with colonial architecture.

The main street is typically Chinese with food and souvenirs, but mostly food.

<p>
And here we smoothly move from Taipa even further south, to the Cotai region. This area is built on land that was dumped in the strait between the islands of COloane and TAIpa. Coloane Island is the most remote and sparsely populated area of ​​Macau, the only one I haven’t reached yet.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255666082_ba4d4cf3a3_o.jpg">
<p>
The Cotai area is home to most of Macau's casinos, which have been built here since 2006.
<p/>

<p>
Most of them belong to the LVS company, which also owns a casino in <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/559887.html">Las Vegas</a>. It turned out that not only the owner is the same, but also some buildings are as similar as two peas in a pod.

<p>
At the moment, the "Strip" in Macau is much smaller than in Las Vegas. It has Venetian, Plaza and Parisian on one side, and City of Dreams and Sands on the opposite side. There are also several newer casinos and hotels on the “second line”. There are essentially two themed casinos: Venice (2006) and Paris (2016). Behind the strip you can see that it hasn't really been fully built yet; Coloane Hill is visible in the distance.

Game rooms. Naturally, photography is not allowed inside. The games there are more varied than I saw in the old downtown casinos in 2013. I found an entire section where they play poker - Texas Hold'em.

The most important thing that has been built in Macau since 2013 is, of course, the epic bridge to Hong Kong, 55 kilometers long, the longest bridge crossing in the world. It is now possible to travel directly between the two special administrative regions by bus. Ferries are also available, however, because depending on your needs it may be more convenient: the ferry is slower than the bus, but leaves from the city center in Hong Kong.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255459062_9393db7bae_o.jpg">
<p>
There are two types of buses - from the center of Hong Kong and from the border terminal. I decided to go step by step to see all the stages, it’s cheaper and it’s not really slower, because you won't get caught in the traffic in the city center. First you need to get to the border terminal in Hong Kong, buses go there from the same terminal metro station as the cheap local buses to the airport. On the way back, I took the wrong bus and took a longer road to the penultimate station, also with a stop at Disneyland. A direct bus from the metro takes only 10 minutes. The border terminal in Hong Kong looks like this.
<p/>

<p>
We cross the border and take a bus that goes to the other end of the bridge.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255459037_bdc3250e13_o.jpg">
<p>
Theoretically, you can drive across the bridge by car, but in reality, during the entire trip I saw only shuttle buses traveling in the opposite direction. So the economic meaning of the bridge is not very clear.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256387758_95bcab2a66_o.jpg">
<p>
The bridge is not really a bridge, a small section after leaving Hong Kong is a tunnel so that ships can pass into the bay above it.

We are approaching Macau. They built a whole artificial island on which the road splits - you can go to Macau, or you can go to <a href="../guangdong">Zhuhai</a> (a city in the main part of China).
