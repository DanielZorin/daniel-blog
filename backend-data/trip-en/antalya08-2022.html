<h1>Turkey: Antalya</h1>

<h2>Antalya</h2>
<p>
One day in August I went for a walk in Antalya. There are still plenty of interesting places there, the first one is just at the entrance to the city from Kemer - the cable car. It is very convenient to get off the bus almost next to the bottom station.

<p>
There is also a small bus depot and the terminus of several city routes.

<p>
The fare for locals is 50 liras, for tourists - 180 ($10).

The rocks are similar to Tahtali.

<p>
There's a restaurant upstairs. You can also drive here by car; there is a road all the way to the top.

The cable car is quite far from the city center, and it can only be seen on the horizon (it was still a little foggy that day).

The area of Antalya closest to Kemer is called Liman (port), it is part of the Konyaalti district.

There are many high-rise buildings here.

In the summer of 2022, they stopped issuing residence permits in this area, since more than 20% of the population were foreigners (the quota was reduced from 25% to 20%).

There are nesting dolls (matrushka in Turkish), but the two smallest ones have disappeared somewhere.

<p>
There is also a Russian grocery store here, although I didn’t find anything particularly interesting there (except maybe bacon). I bought Ukrainian ice cream.

There was still time, I decided to visit museums. The main museum of Antalya is left for another time (it’s worth setting aside a lot of time for it), but here is the museum of the Dervish Order.

Ataturk was in Antalya only three times for a couple of days, and stayed in this house (which was allocated to him by the local authorities). All three times he arrived by ship, apparently at that time the roads in this mountainous region were not very good, and there was no railway in Antalya. Ataturk's bedroom:

Ataturk said that Antalya is the most beautiful place in the world, these words can be seen on monuments in the region. Ataturk's Cabinet:

I walked along the streets of the old city, where old houses still coexist with rebuilt ones.
