<h1>Russia: Moscow</h1>
<i>9 July 2016 - 3 April 2017</i>
<h2>Moscow</h2>
<p>
July 2016, after a year and a half of traveling around Asia, I arrived in Moscow, stayed for 10 days, got a Schengen visa, and went on to Europe. A month and a half later, I settled in St. Petersburg, and during the fall and winter I visited Moscow for short visits, so I was like a tourist all the time.

Soon we will speed up the Internet. The word "speed up" in this context can also mean "disperse" / "dissolve", like "dispersing" a protest by the police force. So prophetic.

The views are mostly industrial, because initially, the tracks were built to meet the needs of the factories, which were then located on the perimeter of Moscow, but now they are somewhere in the middle between the Kremlin and the Moscow Ring Road.

The Palace of Catherine II was originally not completed until the end in the 18th century and was abandoned, turned into ruins, and it was completed under Luzhkov in the 1990's.

For the first time I saw Vnukovo airport after reconstruction; before it was a small and cramped airport, but it has become an excellent modern one. After that, I flew from Vnukovo very often, because there are many cheap flights from there, and this is the most convenient airport in terms of getting there.

<h2>Balashikha</h2>
<p>
The city of Balashikha adjoins Moscow from the east. I always thought that it was BalAshikha (probably because of the famous comic video about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrYFUBA2kUA">foreign language courses in Balashikha</a>), but it turned out that BalashIkha. You need to go here by minibus from the Novogireevo metro station, since the train station is not located in the city center, and trains do not go there very often and take a long time, as the route goes along an arc. The price of travel on a minibus was an unpleasant surprise; it was twice as expensive as in Moscow, although the ride there didn’t take long (if you don’t get caught in a traffic jam).
