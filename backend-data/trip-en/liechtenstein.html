<i>8 July 2013</i>
<p>
There is a small country behind the mountains, behind the forests.

There are animals with kind eyes, there life is full of love.

There the miracle lake sparkles, there is no evil or grief.

There, the Firebird lives in the palace and gives light to people. (<i>Four lines above are taken from a famous Russian pop song</i>)

You can get to Liechtenstein from Switzerland by crossing the bridge over the Rhine (!), or from Austria by road.

<p>
Liechtenstein is so small that you can cross it on foot in a day from west to east. It's longer from north to south. A sign somewhere near the Austrian border, the town of Mauren.

The largest city in Liechtenstein is Schaan, where 10 thousand people live, and the capital Vaduz has half that number.

Moreover, people have reserves of firewood in their yards, apparently for a rainy day.

Schaan has its own license plates. The red and blue flag of Liechtenstein = the flag of Vaduz, and the yellow and red flag is the flag of Schaan.

Oddly enough, in Liechtenstein people are quite religious and place crosses along the roads.
