There are animals with kind eyes, there life is full of love.

You can get to Liechtenstein from Switzerland by crossing the bridge over the Rhine (!), or from Austria by road.

Liechtenstein is so small that you can cross it on foot in a day from west to east. It's longer from north to south. A sign somewhere near the Austrian border, the town of Mauren.

The largest city in Liechtenstein is Schaan, where 10 thousand people live, and the capital Vaduz has half that number.

Moreover, people have reserves of firewood in their yards, apparently for a rainy day.

Schaan has its own license plates. The red and blue flag of Liechtenstein = the flag of Vaduz, and the yellow and red flag is the flag of Schaan.

There are apartment buildings here too, although it would seem that in Liechtenstein there should be enough space for everyone.
