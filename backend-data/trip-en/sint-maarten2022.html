<h1>Sint Maarten</h1>
<i>13-14 May 2022</i>
<p>
To get from St. Kitts to Jamaica, located on the other side of the Caribbean Sea, I had two options: fly through Miami on a single ticket on American Airlines with a long layover and an overnight stay, or fly on two different airlines via Sint Maarten, also with an overnight stay. I chose the second option, since in Sint Maarten there was no need for a Covid test, which is needed in the USA and would have leveled the difference in price. I also found that spending the night in Sint Maarten was more comfortable and cheaper than in Miami, where I was only half a year ago. It turned out, however, that hotels in Sint Maarten have become more expensive since <a href="http://goo.gl/Wtxu7S">2016</a>.

The flight from St. Kitts to St. Maarten was on a small plane. First time in my life I flew in a cabin the size of a minibus.

Here I am at the famous airport.

I booked a room near the airport and got there in about 40 minutes on foot. The room is good, but 75 dollars is a bit expensive, of course, and on booking.com it’s generally twice as expensive (I booked on airbnb). On the French side there were rooms for around $50, but I would have to take a taxi there.

In the morning my flight was around 11, so I took a short walk around the area at dawn. The beach was right next door.

Somewhere here was the yacht that I rented instead of a hotel in 2016.

Interestingly, the Dutch part has telephone numbers with the American code  1, just like the rest of the Caribbean islands. And on the French side the code of France is used.

Departing. The planes take off not over Maho Beach, but in the other direction, and here we just turn around. There are only a few people watching, very few tourists.
