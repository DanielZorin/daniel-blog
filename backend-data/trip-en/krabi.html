<h1>Thailand: Krabi, Ao Nang, Phi Phi</h1>
<i>7-15 March 2020</i>
<h2>Ao Nang</h2>
<p>
I had never been to the province of Krabi before and had long wanted to visit it, because it was perhaps the main white spot in Thailand for me. Krabi is located next to <a href="http://goo.gl/HZjP4G">Phuket</a>, but there was even a direct flight from Kuala Lumpur to the local Krabi airport, very convenient. Usually, “Krabi” in all guidebooks does not mean the city itself, but the beach village of Ao Nang, located 20-30 kilometers away.

Ao Nang is a very touristy place, much like Patong in Phuket. The entire main street is crowded with shops.

Historically, the local population in this region is predominantly Muslim. There is a large mosque in Ao Nang. Now, of course, Muslims are in the minority, since most people moved along with the development of the tourism industry.

To get to the Phi Phi Islands, you need to buy a ticket at any travel agency, which also includes a minibus transfer to the ferry terminal on the outskirts of Krabi. Interestingly, buying a ticket at the port ticket office will be more expensive (despite the fact that you will also have to get to the port yourself). The terminal is located on the banks of the river in the mangroves.

<h2>Phi Phi</h2>
<p>
Phi Phi Islands is one of the famous Thai resorts. They are located in Krabi province halfway to Phuket. Most tourists get here through Phuket, some even come for one day on an excursion. Phi Phi is not a beach in a big city, like <a href="http://goo.gl/tr2vXW">Pattaya</a>, <a href="http://goo.gl/G9wNY1">Samui</a> or Patong. Rather, you can compare it with other paradise islands, such as <a href="http://goo.gl/w2cgAk">Koh Chang</a> or <a href="http://goo.gl/ghxcx6">Perhentians</a>. The Phi Phi Islands are the main island of Phi Phi Don, and many small islands around where there is no housing, and where people go to dive or sunbathe.
<p/>

<p>
Upon arrival, hotel agents stand on the pier and offer accommodation. Accommodation on Phi Phi is expected to be much more expensive than on the mainland. I paid 800 baht for a room with air conditioning (on the mainland it costs 300-400). Even without air conditioning, you can hardly find anything less than 400. But if you compare it with Perhentians, the price is comparable - it was a little cheaper there, but the conditions were more spartan, the air conditioner only worked in the evening and at night, and there was very poor Internet, whereas on Phi Phi I worked online. Other remote resorts in the Southeast Asian region also had comparable prices, so we can assume that housing prices here are normal.

<p>
The village of Tonsai is located on the narrowest part of the island, where from one shore to the other is less than a kilometer. Accordingly, there is a ferry terminal on the southern shore, and a beach on the northern shore, where there are only a few taxi boats.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257685880_629e17051b_o.jpg">

The entire southern shore is densely parked with boats.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255915502_87e6dd5ca9_o.jpg">
<p>
There is also the problem of strong ebbs and flows. Most of the day the boats are grounded, as is the entire beach. You need to get there early in the morning.

The indigenous population of the islands is Muslim, there is even a mosque here. Now the majority here, of course, come from different cities on the mainland to work.

The food is comparable in price to Perhentians, but of course there is much more choice. Of course, it’s much cheaper on the mainland, but as an addition to the beach, the food here is good.

As in the Perhentian Islands, on the Phi Phi Islands you can get around either on foot or by boat taxi. Walking is not so easy because the terrain is rough and you have to walk over hills to get to the remote beaches. Plus the distances on Phi Phi are longer - I walked around the perimeter of Small Perhentian in several steps, but here it’s about 10 kilometers to the northern edge of the island, and on the southern there are no paths at all. Therefore, I explored only the central part of the island, seeing the rest from the water during the excursion.

Low tide. In terms of the underwater world, Phi Phi is generally good, but inferior to Perhentians in terms of accessibility - here diving from the shore is not nearly as interesting, you need to go somewhere by boat.

One day I bought an excursion around the Phi Phi islands, including small Phi Phi Le, to look at the underwater world. The excursion costs 1,300 baht (about $40), due to the fact that the price includes the cost of the ticket to visit the national park (500 baht).

There are too many people from several boats for such a beach. Fortunately, after that our boat practically did not intersect with others, so there were no problems with an overabundance of people.

Phi Phi Le is officially uninhabited - there is no permanent population, and there is almost nowhere - there are only high cliffs everywhere, only a few places where you can land.

The authors of the film actually photoshopped more rocks, so that in the film, when filming from the beach, it seems that the bay is closed on all sides, although in reality this is not the case.

On the Internet you can find funny photos of what this bay looked like during the day in years gone by, when there was a long row of boats along the beach from edge to edge. In 2019, it was closed for a couple of years to restore the ecosystem, so you can only see it from the water.

<h2>Krabi</h2>
<p>
I spent the last days before my flight in the city of Krabi, and it was great. My favorite provincial Thailand with night markets and soup for 30 baht, animal statues at crossroads and wooden houses. The name of the city in Thai has nothing to do with crab, but nevertheless there is a huge crab on the embankment and the image of a crab is often used, apparently due to its association with the English word.

The screen talks about coronavirus. A couple of days before, they announced the closure of European borders, and I was quite glad that I had a plane ticket to Moscow for the near future. In Thailand, many sellers wore masks, and temperatures were taken on ferries. Masks were in short supply, but I managed to buy a few before leaving.

The symbol of Krabi (besides the crab) is the elephant - the first white elephant was found here during the reign of King Rama IX. White elephants are rare, and all that are found are presented to the king, and they are considered his property (although they are usually released into the wild).
