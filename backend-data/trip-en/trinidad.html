<h1>Trinidad and Tobago</h1>
<i>17-18 November 2016</i>
<p>
Trinidad is the southernmost of the Lesser Antilles, and one of the largest. From here it’s a stone’s throw to the mainland; there used to be regular ferries to Venezuela, although it’s not a fact that they still work now due to serious problems in this country. There is oil in Trinidad, and there is almost no tourism, all beach lovers go straight to neighboring Tobago (which, by the way, was for some time a colony of <a href="../latvia">Latvia</a >, more precisely Courland). The capital of Trinidad, Port of Spain, is considered the third most dangerous city in the Caribbean after Port-au-Prince (Haiti) and Kingston (Jamaica).

Upon arrival, it is immediately clear that you are in a banana republic. Right at the airport there is a long row of portraits of the nation's fathers.

Everything is simple here, a little like Asia. Fruits are sold from a tray.

Apart from the bus station area and the central market, the rest of the streets of Port of Spain die out after sunset, and it’s a little scary to walk there.
