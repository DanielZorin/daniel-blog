<h2>Blagoveshchensk</h2>
<p>
Blagoveshchensk is yet another "best city on earth". It can probably be proud of the fact that it is the most remote from all the other best cities on earth. The nearest one is <a href="../vladivostok">Khabarovsk</a>.

Although for thousands of kilometers around Blagoveshchensk there is nothing but icy desert, this city is simply an oasis.

The secret is that it is on the border with China, and previously everyone on the Russian side went across the river to buy cheap goods.

Now, on the contrary, the Chinese go to Russia for cheap chocolate and cookies.

The Chinese influence is evident mainly in the signage.

The main shopping center is called "Heavenly Huafu". On the Chinese side - just "Huafu".

Otherwise it is a typical Russian city.

Surprisingly for such a remote city, Blagoveshchensk has quite a lot of typically Russian architecture from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The main place is the river station. You can go to China, a ticket costs about 1,500 rubles (round-trip about 2,000), so going just for lunch turns out to be very unprofitable. It’s interesting that the Chinese have their own transport, where Russians are not allowed, and something tells me that their prices are much lower.

In summer there are ferries across the river, and in winter there are regular buses.

Goodbye, unwashed Russia,
Country of slaves, country of masters,
And you, blue uniforms,
And you, their devoted people.
