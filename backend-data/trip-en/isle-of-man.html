<h1>Isle of Man</h1>
<i>2 September 2019</i>
<p>
The Isle of Man, the last of the crown lands (besides <a href="../guernsey">Guernsey</a> and <a href="../jersey">Jersey</a>), lies between Ireland and Scotland. Historically, it was settled by Celts from Ireland, who later moved from there to Scotland. During the Middle Ages, Man was at one time the capital of a kingdom that owned all the islands along the western coast of Scotland, and became the prototype for the Iron Islands in Game of Thrones. There are ferries from Belfast and Liverpool to Man, but it is cheaper and faster to fly from Liverpool.

The same coat of arms in sculptural form stands opposite the entrance.

And then it occurs in many other places.

This symbol is called "Triskelion". In addition to the Isle of Man, it is also present on the coat of arms of the Italian island of Sicily.

I bought a bus pass for the whole day, and rode around the island. The airport is at the southern end of the island, so the closest point was Castletown on the southern tip.

<p>
For a long time it was the capital of the island.

A 13th century castle has been preserved here.

The streets didn't look very busy on Monday morning.

Almost all the shops were closed for some reason.

Street signs are duplicated in the Manx language (Celtic group, related to Irish).

Car license plate with triskelion. An interesting fact is that on the Isle of Man some roads outside the cities have no speed limit, which is why they like to film shows about cars here.

<p>
Most buses on Man go through the capital, but there are also routes connecting other cities. So from Castletown I went straight to Peel - the main city on the west coast (and the capital before Castletown).

Here, near the shore on the island, another large medieval castle has been preserved.

From Peel I went directly to Ramsey, a town on the northern edge of the island. Here I found a very authentic bus station.
<p/>

<p>
And also suddenly a train station: there are trains on this small island.

More precisely, it is an electric tram that runs to the capital of the island.

Travel to Douglas costs 6.70, more expensive than the bus (which costs 7 for the whole day).

From here I went to the capital of the island, the city of Douglas on the east coast. I didn’t go out along the way, because the rain was pouring down, and in Douglas I had to run in dashes for more than two hours.

In Douglas, the only horse-drawn tram in the world has been preserved; it should run along the embankment, but in 2019 restoration was just underway, the rails were rebuilt.
