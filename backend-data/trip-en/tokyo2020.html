<h1>Japan: Tokyo, Chiba, Saitama, Gotemba, Odawara, Osaka</h1>

<h2>Narita</h2>
<p>
When I arrived in Japan, the first thing I did was not going to the center of Tokyo, but exploring Chiba Prefecture, where the airport is located. The city closest to the airport, Narita, is quite interesting in itself; there is a bit of old Japan preserved there.

From Narita I quickly went to the regional capital, Chiba.

<p>
The main attraction of Chiba is the suspended tram. This is the largest system of such rare transport in the world. Excluding small systems at airports and amusement parks, there are only three suspended railways operating as public transport in the whole world - in Chiba, between Kamakura and Enoshima Island, and in German city ​​of Wuppertal.

<h2>Saitama</h2>
<p>
Saitama Prefecture begins immediately north of Tokyo. You can get there via many different commuter train lines and even the Tokyo Metro, although not the part that was interesting to me - the line was extended in 2002 for the FIFA World Cup and ends at the football stadium. First of all, I arrived at Kawagoe Station.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255423411_c6b3286715_o.jpg">
<p>
Kawagoe is a historically separate city north of Tokyo, now, of course, it smoothly flows into neighboring cities. From the station there is a central pedestrian street with shops.

<h2>Gotemba</h2>
<p>
I wanted to go to Mount Fuji, but not to the same place I was last time. After studying the maps, I chose the city of Gotemba near the southern slope (last time I was on the eastern slope), where there is a direct bus from Tokyo. The weather was ideal, all that was needed was to find a higher site so that the view of Fuji would not be obscured by poles, wires and buildings.

Parking spaces are marked near the residential building. In Japan they like to install such wheel stops, apparently so that no one accidentally backs into the car when parking.

Since there is little space in Japan, you can often find cars with an unusual square shape - in order to make maximum use of the space, the trunk is made the same height as the interior, or in other models there is simply no trunk in the back, there is glass immediately behind the rear seats. The complete opposite of the USA, where the most popular cars are generally pickups that instead of rear seats have a huge body with an open top.

Tower in the "New World" area. It’s interesting that in Japan the opening hours are not the same as in Europe - at 10 am almost everything is closed, it’s quite normal for a store to open at 11. In Russia and Europe, for some reason, all stores torture employees making them arrive at work at 9 or even 8 , although in the morning there are approximately zero visitors. But in the evening, shops can easily close later.

Since 2019, airbnb operations in Japan have been licensed. I was worried that this would make it expensive, but it seems that most hosts have received all the documents, and in Tokyo you can still rent a room for less than 20 dollars (for example in the Komagome area, which is quite close to the center), and for 25 I later rented an entire studio apartment. Every airbnb now has a sign like this at the entrance.

Near Harajuku Station, I noticed a series of posters. If you don't translate the text from Japanese, you'll never guess what it's about.
