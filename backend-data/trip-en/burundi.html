<h1>Burundi: Bujumbura, Gitega, Muyinga</h1>
<i>17 July 2024</i>
<h2>Bujumbura</h2>
<p>
Burundi is a small country in the center of Africa. For a long time, it was the most difficult to access of the Uganda-Rwanda-Burundi trio: a visa had to be obtained at the embassy, ​​and they were reluctant to issue it. The civil war in Burundi ended much later than in Rwanda, and the country is only just opening up. In terms of GDP per capita, Bunundi was still in last place in the world a couple of years ago! Though, GDP is not very indicative for countries where most of the economy is informal.
Another problem for Burundi is its bad relations with Rwanda. The border was only opened a few years ago, and in 2024 it was closed again. I found out about this a couple of days before arriving in Burundi, and I had to come up with something. The border to Tanzania is open, and there are direct buses, but they go to Kigoma - that's exactly in the opposite direction from Rwanda. I didn't want to fly for $600 either, so I decided to take the shortest route through Tanzania in the northeast. I found a couple of reports from travelers who had driven there by car/motorbike, and hoped that some kind of transport would be found, at least hitchhiking. The road was going to be long, so I didn't spend the night in the capital of Burundi, as I had originally planned.

Bujumbura is a typical African city, where everyone gathers in the center to go shopping.

There are several monuments, for example, a colored bust.

The main monument is not in very good condition.

The cleaners chased me away from there, saying the park was closed for reconstruction.

The architecture is approximately like this.

<p>
By the way, note that there are no motorcycles on the streets, which is strange, because it is a rather poor country. Later in Rwanda and Uganda I rode a lot on motorcycles, because there are more of them than cars, like in Asia. But in Burundi, taxis are only cars, blue and white. And taxis are also quite expensive. In short, this is the case when simple things become elite due to low demand.

Advertisement for a money transfer service from the operator Lumitel. In many African countries, cashless payments through such systems are widespread, essentially by phone number, this is a replacement for traditional banks, which are probably as awful and outdated here as in other countries.

<h2>Gitega</h2>
<p>
From Bujumbura I went to Gitega - it's exactly in the direction I needed. Several years ago, the capital was moved there, although Bujumbura is a much larger city. I made a mistake by going by bus - I should have gone by shared taxi, it's much faster. The bus traveled 100 kilometers to Gitega for three hours, even though there were almost no stops - it just pulled very poorly up the mountain, and the road there is winding. Unfortunately, I was unable to photograph the most beautiful views along the way.

Bus station. Here I transferred to a shared taxi, and things went faster. Though, there were four of us crammed into the back seat, so the ride wasn't too comfortable, but at least I was by the window.

The main thing that catches your eye in Burundi is that there are a lot of people walking along the highway.

<h2>Muyinga</h2>
<p>
A relatively large city in northeastern Burundi is called Muyinga. From here to the border with Tanzania it is about 25 kilometers, which I covered by taxi for speed.

A fish stall and a bakery. The goods are depicted on the walls. I wonder where the fish come from in the interior of the continent. Probably from Lake Tanganyika.

Approach to the border. The system here is as follows: two border posts are located 2-3 kilometers from each other. But you only need to go to one - if you are going to Tanzania, then to the one on the Tanzanian side (if you are going to Burundi, to the other). At each post there are border guards from both countries, so first you get an exit stamp in one window, and immediately an entry stamp in the neighboring one, and you can go.

Between the posts I also rode on a motorcycle taxi, having given away almost all the few remaining Burundian money. Less than $1 left.
