<h1>Belarus: Brest</h1>
<i>7-8 August 2013</i>
<h2>Brest</h2>
<p>
Almost two and a half years <a href="../belarus">later</a> I again found myself in the 'cleanest place on the globe' (<i>It is a slogan of Belarusian propaganda, also used in pro-government songs</i>). This time - the hero city of Brest.

This is a copy, by the way. The original of this fragment of the wall is kept in a museum in Moscow.

<p>
The Brest Fortress is the main attraction of the city. Belovezhskaya Pushcha is also nearby, but I didn’t have enough time for it, so I decided to leave it for next time.

<p>
In addition to the well-known events of 1941, in the Brest Fortress, Trotsky signed the Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty, which ended the First World War for Russia. The building where the signing took place has practically not been preserved, only the foundation remains.

But not everything in Brest is devoted to a military theme.

I would say that in the center there is little that reminds us of it.

<p>
So, the cleanest place on the globe.

Although Belarus is a dictatorship, Sanya (Lukashenko) keeps the country afloat with the help of “administrative resources” from Russia and other CIS countries, so one cannot help but pay tribute to the excellent state of the infrastructure for such a poor country.

"There are trams, taxis and buses..."

In Brest, houses are painted, but there are no gray barracks. New houses are also being built.

TSUM. Sanya's portraits are for sale, I didn't buy them because I was too lazy to carry them around for a week.  (<i>Sanya is a short version of the name Alexander. There was a song before the election, with refrain "Sanya will stay with us, everything will be okay" - Lukashenko was not mentioned directly but the song was used in his campaign</i>)

Not a single city in Russia has drinking fountains (except for the water pump), but in Brest there are.

Monument to Lenin in place. They still put flowers on it.

Is it just me that these faces remind me of Putin and Yanukovych? The one on the left is exactly the spitting image of Putin.

<p>
Belarusian spelling still resembles the “Albanian language” (<i>Albanian language is a Russian meme, used to call writing Russian words phonetically</i>).

The most noticeable feature of Belarus is that people here always cross the road only when the light is green. Even if it is five meters wide. Even at night, when there are no cars within a kilometer radius.

In Brest, there has recently been a tradition of lighting lanterns at sunset.

And people watch and take pictures.
