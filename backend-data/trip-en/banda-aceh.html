<h1>Indonesia: Banda Aceh, Weh Island</h1>
<i>24-28 May 2019</i>
<h2>Banda Aceh</h2>
<p>
From Kuala Lumpur I flew to Indonesia for 5 days to the island of Sumatra and its northernmost province of Aceh. It’s even cheaper to fly there from KL than from <a href="../sumatra">Medan</a>. Aceh is one of the most unusual provinces in Indonesia. In this country, the further you go to the east, the more Christianity replaces Islam, and when you move to the west, it’s the other way around: Aceh has a certain autonomy and Sharia laws apply here, just like in Saudi Arabia. Here was the longest and fiercest resistance to Dutch colonization, and in the 20th century, a long-term guerrilla struggle for independence, the most fierce in Indonesia. In 2004, a terrible tsunami in the Indian Ocean destroyed many coastal cities, including popular resorts in Thailand and Sri Lanka, but the main blow fell precisely on Aceh, where more than 100 thousand people died, according to the most conservative estimates. After this, the separatists agreed to autonomy, and now everything is calm in the region. The capital is called Banda Aceh.

Like the rest of Sumatra, the province is quite hilly, which made guerrilla operations easier.

The airport is quite new and shiny, but they don't havean electronic board here; the list of departures is written on the board with a marker.

<p>
You can get from the airport to the city by bus, as in some other large cities in Indonesia, there is a network of buses with dedicated lines and separate stops. Typical Indonesia.

From the port of Banda Aceh I took a ferry to Weh Island.
<p/>
<h2>Weh Island</h2>
<p>
Weh Island, off the northwestern coast of Sumatra, is the farthest tip of Indonesia. You can get here from Banda Aceh by ferry in a couple of hours. It’s also one of the most heavenly places I’ve ever been.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254652127_68f8c7569b_o.jpg">

<p>
We approach the ferry terminal. The island is quite mountainous, and only a small part of it has been developed. In the southeast of the island (closer to Sumatra) there is a ferry terminal, in the northeast there is the city of Sabang, and I was traveling to the northwestern edge, where there is a small resort village of Iboih.
<p/>

The views from them are also amazing.

<p>
I checked into this hotel, right into a room with an orange balcony.
<p/>

<p>
Opposite the village you can see land - it’s an elongated narrow island, about 500 meters away in a straight line; I got there by swimming.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256428905_1d3d86c0b2_o.jpg">
<p>
There is a very rich underwater world here (especially considering that this is not a place remote from civilization, you can snorkel right from your room). I even saw octopuses and schools of squid.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255385006_85a0eebcf8_o.jpg">
<p>
You can also hire a motorboat to go around the nearby island.

<p>
You should swim carefully, I once saw a lionfish, and multiple crown of thorns starfish, which are poisonous.
<p/>

<p>
All this beauty is also quite cheap - the room cost about 20 dollars (with air conditioning), in Thailand and Malaysia it is usually more expensive.
<p/>

<p>
I also rented a kayak, but it was difficult to navigate due to the strong current in the strait between the village and the island.
<p/>

Let's look a little at Iboih. This is a small village without large hotels, only modest guesthouses.
<p/>

The atmosphere, of course, is not party-like, especially since alcohol is prohibited here.

<p>
In general, everything is not bad with food - there are quite a lot of restaurants, in addition to Indonesian food, you can also get European food. Nasi goreng is top notch.
<p/>

Ten kilometers from Iboih there is another interesting monument; you can get there by tuk-tuk.

<p>
This is Indonesia's kilometer zero. Formally, Weh Island is not the northernmost or westernmost point of the country; the map shows small islands even further away, but they are either uninhabited or occupied by military bases. And the roads end here.
<p/>

On the other side of the country in Merauke there is also a zero kilometer, although, judging by the photo, it is much more modest.
