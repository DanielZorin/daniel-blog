<h1>Russia: Sain Petersburg, Gatchina</h1>
<i>27 July - 1 August 2020</i>
<h2>Saint Petersburg</h2>
<p>
I haven’t been to St. Petersburg for more than two years, since transit in <a href="../spb02-2018">February 2018</a>. It was simply necessary to visit good old St. Petersburg.
<p/>

<p>
Excluding the distant suburbs, in the main part of St. Petersburg it is no longer easy to find places where I have not been, but one important blank spot still remained - Lakhta. The very place where the Olgino-Lakhta trolls are based, as well as the infamous Zenit Gazprom Arena stadium, which was destroyed by cormorants. For the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two new metro stations were opened on the green line: Novokrestovskaya and Begovaya. The first one is right next to the stadium. Apparently, they were in such a hurry that they did it poorly, and already in 2020 Novokrestovskaya was closed for repairs, so the trains didn’t even stop there. It’s good that you can go to Begovaya.

<p>
The station, the namesake of the Moscow metro station, is located next to the park of the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg. It has also become more convenient from here to travel west to Kronstadt and Sestroretsk, so as not to be stuck in a minibus to the Chernaya Rechka.

In the distance is a panorama of the seaside part of Vasilyevsky Island.

A little further to the west is the Lakhta Center.
<p/>

<p>
This is the tallest building in Europe (462 meters). In 2020, the construction of the building itself had already been completed, but the insides were still in the process of being prepared for use. There is supposed to be an observation deck at the top.

<p>
On this trip, I tried to be as much of a tourist as possible and didn’t do any work at all. I went to see the draw of the bridges - I had only seen it a couple of times before, in 2002 and from afar in 2016, and had never taken a photo.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254680877_de77d43b53_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I lived on Vasilievsky Island, the advantage of this location is the opportunity to look at the bridges from the less popular northern side (and not remain cut off from the house).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256456800_8f21aa2123_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This particular bridge is usually printed on all postcards - the Palace Bridge.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256159929_e3a19ae53b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It is opened first at 1:10, and both neighboring bridges are opened 10-15 minutes later, so ships would not be able to pass under it anyway. I think this was done so that tourist ships would see the opening of the Palace Bridge at 1:10, and in 20 minutes the path would be cleared for large ships. A whole flotilla gathers under the Palace Bridge.

If St. Petersburg was somewhere in England or Holland, there would be one lane in each direction, and you could cross the turnout at any point and not have to wait for a minute and a half. Night is a rare opportunity to look at this road from the middle; in general, in this place you can’t even cross the streets, you need to go back all the way to the stock exchange.

St. Petersburg has incredibly beautiful skies (when it’s not raining, of course), and in the summer there are good chances of catching something like this:

The place where I lived in 2017 has been abandoned for three years. Even the signs haven't changed; inside there are remnants of old tiles. It's amazing how a place in the very center of St. Petersburg, 10 minutes from the station on foot, can stand abandoned.

In general, it looks abandoned, but a small part of the ground floor is used by a banquet hall, so part of the walls and windows in the hall have been restored, but the rest have not.

<h2>Zelenogorsk</h2>
<p>
St. Petersburg is divided into 18 districts (<i>rayon</i> in Russian). Central areas with dense buildings are divided into sub-districts (<i>okrug</i> in Russian). (Interestingly, in Moscow it’s the other way around - <i>okrugs</i> are divided into districts). But remote areas like Kurortny are divided into cities and towns. St. Petersburg thus includes 9 cities: Lomonosov, <a href="../spb2016">Peterhof</a>, Krasnoye Selo, <a href="../spb2016">Pushkin</a>, Pavlovsk, <a href="../spb2014">Kolpino</a>, <a href="../petersburg">Kronstadt</a>, <a href="../vyborg">Sestroretsk</a> and Zelenogorsk. I was in Lomonosov (aka Oranienbaum) and Pavlovsk, but a long time ago (2001-2003), so there were two left: Zelenogorsk and Krasnoye Selo. Zelenogorsk is the furthest city from the center, and at the same time the fastest in terms of transport, since it only takes half an hour to get there by Lastochka train St Petersburg-Vyborg.

We depart from the Finland Station. Here stands Lenin's train, on which he fled to Finland in 1917 and then returned.

The city is not very urban, rather a resort village with parks, there are only a few slightly denser neighborhoods.

<h2>Krasnoye Selo</h2>
<p>
The last city within the boundaries of St. Petersburg where I hadn't been was Krasnoye Selo. I mistakenly believed that I visited the Krasnoselsky district back in 2013 via of Pulkovo airport, but the airport is in the Moskovsky district. I first came to that district only in 2017 - at the "Yunona" market. In reality, the area is such that you can’t just get there by accident. Along the highways there are all giant shopping centers, several new neighborhoods with questionable transport accessibility, and the notorious Kadyrov Bridge. And in the farthest corner, on a ledge surrounded by the Leningrad region, stands the city of Krasnoye Selo.

From the station you need to walk about a kilometer and a half through a forest park to the central square.
<p/>

<p>
Krasnoye Selo is the most uninteresting of the nine cities within St. Petersburg; it can even be called a city with a stretch - rather an urban-type settlement in scale. Almost all the houses are late Soviet.

<h2>Gatchina</h2>
<p>
Gatchina is the only major imperial residence that is located on the territory of the Leningrad region, and not St. Petersburg. It takes no more than an hour to get to Gatchina from Moskovskaya Square or the Baltic Station. Gatchina is the largest city in the Leningrad region (but still less than 100k population).

There are two palaces in Gatchina: the main (Bolshoi) and Priory (Prioratsky). The Priory Palace, stylized as a medieval European monastery, was built under Emperor Paul for the prior of the Order of Malta.
