<h1>USA: Laredo, San Antonio, New Orleans, Houston, Dallas</h1>
<i>23-26 November 2014</i>
<h2>Laredo</h2>
<p>
Beyond the border terminal was a completely different country. Although the language of the inscriptions has not changed much, it is immediately clear that you are in America.
<p/>

I can't help but express my respect for a country where, across such a vast territory from Maine to San Diego and from Alaska to Miami, they were able to put the same street signs everywhere.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256343066_4e6d2b4f64_o.jpg">
<p>
There are also much fewer wires here.

<p>
I haven’t been to the deepest outback of the USA; probably, Laredo, of all the cities I’ve seen, best fits the definition of the end of the world. However, here, too, in the central square, there is a map of the historical center for tourists.
<p/>

There are a couple of rich 20s buildings here.

If you ask me to show the atmosphere of the USA in one photo, I would probably choose this one, taken on the road from Laredo. The route and the classic American “Wrong way” sign, which hangs everywhere where you shouldn’t turn, in case someone does turn. Well, McDonald’s, my dear, where would we be without it.

<h2>San Antonio</h2>
<p>
Texas sounds cool. The local residents are famous for their conservatism and love of weapons. Texas and the rest of the south are the place where I will go to travel in the USA, if I have a driver's license, should be very cool. In the meantime, I had to limit myself to the main cities. Texas has four main cities: San Antonio is the former capital, Houston is the largest city, Austin is the capital, and Dallas is the largest metropolitan area. These cities are quite well connected by bus routes, and the distances are short - four hours maximum (although driving Texas from edge to edge will take much longer). San Antonio is rightfully considered the most interesting city from a historical point of view.

Here is one of the places of American military glory - the Alamo.
<p/>

<p>
I have already <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/374598.html">talked</a> briefly about the war between the United States and Mexico. The Mexicans, after a two-week siege, stormed this monastery and killed all 250 defenders, losing twice as many (having 10 times more manpower). A month later, the Texans avenged the Alamo by defeating Santa Anna's army.
I only have one question left: how did 250 people fit in such a small monastery?
<p/>

Here is this courtyard, and on the other side it’s the same, and that’s it.

This is what the main and only station of a city with a population of several million looks like. There are trains a couple of times a day, the rest of the time the station is closed and there is no one there.

Advertising on the bus. American lawyers are so rich that they can post personal advertisements. It is very difficult to become a lawyer in the USA, much like it is to become a notary in Russia.

The main slogan of Texas is "Don't mess with Texas." Written on half of the souvenirs. There is also the slogan “Everything is bigger in Texas.”

In San Antonio, the house where O. Henry lived and published his magazine a hundred years ago has been preserved. Such a small house surrounded by more modern ones.

In Texas you can carry a gun (unlike New York and California), but you are subject to merciless fines for not having a license.

There are quite a lot of tourists in San Antonio, mostly Americans, of course. Tourists are transported here on carriages, just like in the fairy tale about Cinderella.
<p/>

But the main feature of San Antonio is the River Walk. The city consists of two levels. At the top are all the main streets and buildings. The river flows below, and there is an embankment along it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255451096_9c210474b7_o.jpg">

There are few trees at the top, but here it’s just a garden.

<h2>New Orleans</h2>
<p>
Of all the cities in the United States, I most wanted to visit New Orleans, so I specially adjusted the route to get there.
<p/>

<p>
Louisiana is the deep south, so the concentration of African Americans here is much higher than the national average. I settled in an area that is described in guidebooks as the most dangerous area of the city, where you should not go even during the day. There was the cheapest hostel for $16. Once again, I was convinced that the opinion of Americans regarding security should not be trusted. Apparently, they were outraged by the quality of asphalt in the area.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257601000_c23dd502ff_o.jpg">
<p>
Yes, the road surface here is just like in a typical Russian city.

<p>
More than 10 years ago, New Orleans was practically destroyed by a hurricane, and the population dropped sharply. Sometimes you can find abandoned houses. I was very surprised that on the hostel’s website it was written that “due to the consequences of Hurricane Katrina, we do not work full time, so check-in is from 17-00.” 10 years have passed, and the damn hurricane still won’t let go.
<p/>

<p>
There is a tourist ferry that runs along the river at an exorbitant price, but you can also take a cheaper ride - for $2 one way on the ferry. Previously, the ferry was generally free.
<p/>

New Orleans was founded by the French; after the defeat of France in the Seven Years' War, this territory went to Spain, after another 40 years Napoleon returned it, but three years later sold it to the United States.

Thanks to the French (more precisely, the Creoles), Louisiana acquired its own unique cuisine. Prices, like everywhere else in America, are steep, but I couldn’t help but take the chance to try fried crocodile. I report: crocodile meat is tough (tougher than lamb) and stringy. Without the sauce it would be tasteless, but with the sauce it is ok.

New Orleans is considered a very poor city by US standards. Salaries here are low. For comparison: here you can have a good meal at McDonald's for only 5 dollars, the same lunch in California will cost ten. At the same time, there are much fewer homeless and antisocial elements than I expected. There was only one weird place - under the overpass.

For some reason, the guidebooks write that it is unsafe to walk there alone, although in reality there are many excursion groups there, and the area is small. You can’t go there at night even if you want to, because it’s closed. Although, it looks like someone is climbing over the fence here.

People were buried in such stone sarcophagi because New Orleans is located in swamps, and ordinary graves would quickly be washed away.

I knew that somewhere in this cemetery there was the grave of the voodoo priestess Marie Laveau, where people leave souvenirs for good luck by placing crosses on her grave. It turned out that there were two such graves, and both were not signed.

Local drink number one: low-alcohol cocktail, in which the main feature is a grenade-shaped vessel. It is filled with a soft drink, and a small plastic grenade with an alcoholic drink is thrown inside, so one cocktail can be reloaded several times.

<h2>Houston</h2>
<p>
Little is known about Houston, the fourth city in the United States, other than the fact that the American space flight control center is located there (Houston, we have a problem!). The offices of American oil companies that pump oil in the Gulf of Mexico are based here. Houston is the embodiment of the American urban planning tradition: a huge area, low population density, very wide roads and cheap parking.

In the evening I saw a funny sight: in one restaurant there was a huge crowd, celebrating something, with many cars parked around. Outside this restaurant there is dead silence, there are no passers-by, no cars.

There is public transportation in Houston! Here, you can even figure out the route.

There is one tram line called metro. The fare is only $1.25, apparently, encouraging the population to use the tram. Indeed, there are white people on trams.

There is so much space in Houston that there is a huge vacant lot right outside of downtown.

In downtown I was overcome with a kind of childish delight at the skyscrapers around me.

It's completely free, and no one even controls the entrance. Apparently tourists don't bother. There's just an office there, and in front of the entrance, near the elevators, there's a hall with floor-to-ceiling windows.

There is one very interesting monument in Houston. This is George Bush (father) himself. Apparently, in America it is considered normal to erect a monument during one’s lifetime. The Houston airport also bears Bush's name.

<h2>Dallas</h2>
<p>
Dallas is where John Kennedy was assassinated. This is the street, this is the house.

Other than the Kennedy assassination site, I didn't have much of an idea of what to see in Dallas. I went for a walk around the city center. The place is not the nicest, unlike Houston and San Antonio. There are some asocial elements on the streets.

There is a small park, completely empty in the evening. Indeed, it is unlikely that anyone will specifically go to the park by car. Probably only office workers from neighboring buildings walk here.

When I took a photo of this 7-eleven, there was a black man in the frame on the opposite side of the street. He was not too lazy to catch up with me and ask to delete the photo (although I did not notice him at all and had already moved on). I had to take another photo. The building itself interested me because it has a bare end, which is very rare in Europe and very common in America.

I took the tram and went straight to the airport, where I was going to sleep on a bench.

The tram is quite decent, there are no people in the evening. That evening was Thanksgiving, and all decent Americans were sitting at home eating turkey.

Dallas airport turned out to be very convenient. There is fast internet and comfortable soft chairs where to sleep. I thought I would be the only one, but there were a lot of people, since there are a lot of morning flights. At about 5 am I was awakened by loud announcements and slamming doors. Around 8:00 I flew to San Francisco with a layover in Las Vegas.
