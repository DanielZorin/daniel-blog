<h1>Dominica</h1>
<i>2-4 May 2022</i>
<p>
Dominica's brand is "Nature island", as it is the Caribbean island with the lowest population density, and a significant part of it is occupied by jungle. In terms of landscapes, Dominica is more similar to Indonesia or Brazil than other countries in the region.

I arrived to Dominica on the Express des Iles ferry. This is what the southern part of the island looks like from the water.

The southern edge of the island is called Scotts Head.

<p>
For the first and last time on this trip, I saw a cruise ship in the port. For this reason, the embankment was made pedestrian, and there were souvenir stalls there.

And nothing else worked that day, because it was a holiday (May 1, moved to May 2, just like in Russia).

The fact that Roseau is a French city is noticeable by the presence of a large number of wall-to-wall balconies.

COVID-19 exists, get vaccinated! I also got sick: in St. Lucia I already didn’t feel well, and by the evening of the first day in Dominica I started having a strong cough; in fact, the symptoms were similar to omicron. First thing in the morning I went to get tested, but fortunately the result was negative. On the second day I felt generally better, but I still not strong enough to go around the island or rent a car (I was considering this scenario). During the first half of the day I wandered through the streets of Roseau in search of some place where I could have a tasty meal.

This turned out to be a non-trivial task - I did not find a single restaurant in the entire capital. Only a few fast food joints and canteens, something like this:

<p>
Most of the places indicated on the map do not actually exist - they probably closed during the pandemic. I went in, there were burgers, the seller ignored me for about five minutes, tenaciously making burger buns, I got tired of it and left.

Restaurant "Italy" sounds encouraging.

As a result, the most decent place in all of Dominica is good old KFC. No wonder the queue is the longest there; I had to stand for about 30 minutes.

In the afternoon, mustering my strength, I went to the center of the island. This is the village of Trafalgar.

Reminds me a little of <a href="../hawaii">Hawaii</a>, you don’t see this often in the Caribbean.

Flowerbeds made of tires are certainly not Hawaiian, more like in Oceania.

Prices in supermarkets in Dominica, as in neighboring countries, are jaw-dropping. A small apple, for some reason called Large, costs more than a dollar.

A bottle of knockoff Dr. Pepper is $7! I think this is the most expensive soda I've ever seen.

A dozen eggs cost almost $3.5! (as it turned out later, this is not the limit).

On the way from Guadeloupe to Antigua the plane had a stopover in Dominica, so I looked at this island from above.

Dominica's main airport is located in the northeast, quite far from the capital.
