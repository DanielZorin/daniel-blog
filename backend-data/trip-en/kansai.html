<h1>Japan: Kyoto, Nara, Ikaruga, Kashihara, Osaka</h1>
<i>5-10 December 2017</i>
<h2>Kyoto</h2>
<p>
Kyoto is the previous (before the 17th century) capital and main historical city in Japan. It was not bombed during the war (due to its historical value), but still the city suffered greatly from a fire in the 19th century, plus in the 20th it was extensively rebuilt and modernized, as a result it has a very unusual structure for a tourist city: all the sights are located on the outskirts, so you need to constantly travel by bus. However, a ticket for the whole day costs only 500 yen.

<p>
In Kyoto, my airbnb accommodation was unusual - apparently it was an inn at some kind of temple, at least the rooms were in the backyard.
<p/>

<p>
Everything is classic - futon (sleeping mattress), kotatsu (table at which you can sit on the floor, heated underneath).

My dinner. On the right is okonomiyaki, sometimes called Japanese pizza.

<p>
First of all, I decided to take a ride to the most famous places. Started at the main Buddhist temple Kiyomizu-dera.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256528533_24f1aef1b3_o.jpg">
<p>
It turned out that the temple was under renovation and looked something like this:
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256528568_389bd5d10c_o.jpg">
<p>
Here's how it should be:
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256528603_000d02af66_o.jpg">
<p>
The view of the city is still good.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256330996_35c86c583c_o.jpg">
<p>
And the autumn garden is even better.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257371125_4bed766acf_o.jpg">
<p>
There are noticeably many tourists near the most famous attractions in Kyoto.
<p/>

<p>
Just like that, *noticeably*.

Queue to the source for cleansing. And the source itself is quite large.

<p>
From Kiyomizu Temple I walked to Fushimi Inari in less than an hour.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257077859_aef3a44271_o.jpg">
<p>
Along the way there was another large Buddhist monastery, which was much less crowded (Tofuku-ji).
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256528773_c46d8042d2_o.jpg">
<p>
Fushimi Inari is probably the most recognizable place in Japan after Mount Fuji.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257371265_9742b24ca0_o.jpg">
<p>
In Lithuania they put up <a href="../lithuania">crosses</a>, in Myanmar - <a href="../mandalay">pagodas</a> , and in Kyoto it's orange gates.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256528838_51530cd878_o.jpg">
<p>
For some reason, everyone advises to come here almost at five in the morning so that there is no crowd, but in my opinion you don’t need to do this if you don’t enjoy getting up at 5 in the morning.
<p/>

<p>
I will give another piece of advice: come at any time and walk at least 500 meters from the entrance. It will be easy to take photos like this there.

<p>
The sanctuary is located on a hill, and you can climb to the very top, although it will take at least 45 minutes.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257371450_9245c22375_o.jpg">
<p>
This is the most popular area right at the entrance where everyone takes pictures.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257077909_cda493ff00_o.jpg">
<p>
There is still a lot of free space at the top, I even saw the new gate being installed live.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256331571_8e6ddbc656_o.jpg">
<p>
On the side of the gate it is written who installed it and when.

<p>
Along the way there are also places with altars, where they simply place smaller gates.
<p/>

<p>
This is what the altar looks like at the very, very top, very few visitors get there (compared to the number of people at the entrance below).

I entered from the side entrance, so I only saw the main entrance at the very end.

To complete the picture, on the same day I went to the third main place in Kyoto - the Golden Temple (Kinkaku-ji).

You can’t go inside here, just take a walk in the park.

There are more than 15 temples in Kyoto that are included in the World Heritage List (and there are others that are not included, including Fushimi-Inari, which is constantly changing and therefore does not meet the rules), I did not expect to visit more than half, so that there was something to do to Kyoto next time. When there was something along the way, I could go and have a look.
<p/>

<p>
It is curious that all Shinto temples in Kyoto are free, while Buddhist ones usually are paid. This is Kamigamo Shrine.
<p/>

<p>
Previously, it was only possible to get there in a very difficult way with pre-registration, but now there are no problems, entrance is free for all.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257078819_11de02f954_o.jpg">

The palace grounds are gigantic. This is only the second level of walls.

But in residential areas the opposite is true, there are many narrow alleys and undulating roofs.

The geographical center of Kyoto is located at the railway station, everything here is built up with shopping centers.

There are also two subway lines in Kyoto, but they pass through the center and are not close to attractions, so it is more useful for tourists to take the bus.

<h2>Nara</h2>
<p>
The oldest capital of Japan is best known for the fact that deer live in the city center.

Deer were considered sacred animals here until the 1950s, but now they delight city guests.

All the deer roam in the area where the temples are concentrated; they are not found in the densely built-up parts of the city around the station.

<h2>Kashihara</h2>
<p>
Not far from Nara there is a small town that has preserved the wooden architecture of the 17th century - Imai-cho. Now this is the Kashihara area, the nearest train stations are Unebi (JR Line) or Yagi-Nishiguchi (Kintetsu Line).

<p>
The line from Nara towards Unebi is so local that there are no turnstiles at the stations; the fare is shown on a board, like on buses. The ticket is supposed to be thrown into a box, but I took the opportunity to keep it as a souvenir.

<h2>Osaka</h2>
<p>
Osaka is Japan's second largest city, but is not as popular as the neighboring ancient capital of Kyoto. In fact, Osaka, Kyoto and many neighboring cities already constitute one large city (like Tokyo, Yokohama and the surrounding area) - the Kansai region. In Japan, Kansai is famous for its cuisine and recognizable dialect. Osaka has always been a trading city; there are no super-famous palaces or temples here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257640605_18c1eeeb1a_o.jpg">
<p>
Osaka has its own castle, the most visited in Japan. The main tower was reconstructed in 1931.

One evening in Osaka I walked around a Japanese sex shop. While in Europe 95% of goods in sex shops are intended for women, here it’s the other way around - sex shops are mainly for men.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257640720_648dda73af_o.jpg">
<p>
Three floors of this shopping center out of 6 are allocated for sex shops. T-shirts are sold on the first floor, regular DVDs are sold on the second, porn films are sold on the third, sex toys and other devices are sold on the fourth and fifth.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256597396_318ce54371_o.jpg">
<p>
The hardest thing to understand is how large stores selling DVDs can exist in the 21st century; before, I only saw this in countries like Myanmar or the islands of Oceania, where not all people still have the Internet. But for some reason this industry is alive in Japan. Torrents have long been banned here (although everything is available for those who know, there are even ultra-anonymous Japanese networks such as Perfect Dark), and streaming services have not yet appeared, and apparently the Japanese are so law-abiding that the majority buy CDs the old fashioned way.

In addition to draconian laws on copyright infringement, Japan also has a funny law on pornography - in all porn, the genitals are covered with blurred squares. But boobs are not genitals, they can be shown.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257845835_6b03b56f66_o.jpg">
<p>
At the same time, the law has nothing against the most severe perversions, which would be difficult to find even on the Internet. There is even a video in the “copro” genre quite openly sold there, lying on the counter as if it's nothing special (I took a photo, but decided not to post it anyway).

What's even more shocking are the prices. They are simply absurdly high - one disk costs 20-30 dollars. Even in America there are no such prices for collector's editions.

In general, Japanese media companies are very greedy; say, regular anime on DVD and BluRay release two half-hour episodes per disc, although the entire season could easily fit on Bluray.
