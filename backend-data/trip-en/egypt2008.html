<h1>Egypt: Sharm-el-Sheikh</h1>
<i>January 26 - February 6, 2008</i>
<p>
The third trip to Egypt, by coincidence, was on exactly the same dates as the second, only a year later. This time I didn’t go anywhere from Sharm. I remember a cool beach near the hotel - the hotel itself was on a high cliff above the sea, and to get to the beach you had to go down into a small crevice.
