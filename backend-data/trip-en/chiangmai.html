<h1>Thailand: Chiang Khong, Chiang Rai, Chiang Saen, Mae Salong, Chiang Mai, Lampang, Sukhothai</h1>
<i>14-29 January 2016</i>
<h2>Chiang Khong</h2>
<p>
The first Thai city after the border with Laos. A few years ago, about 10 kilometers from the city center, a bridge was built across the Mekong, along which the border passes. Laos is on the other side.

The weather in Chiang Khong in January is about the same as in Moscow in the summer - 20-25 degrees, but for locals this is a reason to wear a warm jacket.

<p>
Near Chiang Rai there is perhaps the most recognizable (despite being only 20 years old) temple in Thailand - Wat Rong Khun.

It's not hot in Chiang Rai, you can live without air conditioning. To celebrate, I checked into the first hostel I came across for only 250 baht.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255283207_57675babf5_o.jpg">
<p>
The very next day I left there. This hostel had literally every fault you could think of. Cardboard walls through which you could listen to conversations in the next room, an uncomfortable bed (instead of a mattress), a gap in the door through which you could see half the room, a shower on the floor with an always wet floor.
<p/>

In general, Chiang Rai is a pleasant and cheap city, perhaps the best in northern Thailand. There is a decent food court here.

The small town of Chiang Saen pleasantly surprised me. There are many ancient temples and walls scattered throughout the city.

Just 10 kilometers from Chiang Saen is the “Golden Triangle” - the place where the borders of Thailand, Laos and Myanmar meet. The contrast is huge - there are a million tourists with selfie sticks and a bunch of monuments, one more kitschy than the other.

<h2>Mae Salong</h2>
<p>
Lost in the mountains of Chiang Rai province is the Chinese village of Santikhiri, better known by its old name Mae Salong. After the defeat of the “whites” in the civil war in China, the division located in Yunnan province was unable to evacuate to <a href="../taiwan">Taiwan</a> due to the distance from seas. The soldiers were relocated to Myanmar, and after another 10 years they were given refuge in northern Thailand in exchange for help maintaining stability in the area so that the communists would not get through.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256402716_f68aa9e60e_o.jpg">
<p>
To get to Mae Salong, you need to take a bus towards the junction of the three borders and get off in the middle in the town of Mae Chan.

<h2>Chiang Mai</h2>
<p>
I didn't like the city right away. To begin with, I spent three hours looking for a hotel, and not even because it was expensive, but because there was simply no room anywhere - despite the fact that there is a hotel in every second house, there are dozens of them. Then it took another two hours to find a place to eat. Everywhere was very expensive for tourists. No city in Thailand is as crowded with tourists as Chiang Mai, even Khao San in Bangkok doesn't have that ghetto feel. However, in the following days I came to the conclusion that it was very possible to live here. The city center is a square surrounded by a moat. The eastern half of the square and the adjacent area behind the moat are a tourist area. There is no need to go there, and then there are almost no problems, everything around is cheap, and it is not as hot as in the center and south.
If we talk about a tourist visit, then Chiang Mai is incredibly overrated. In reality, this is a transit city that can be explored in less than a day; then you can safely leave for Chiang Rai, because there is nothing outstanding here, and you need to somehow get out of the ghetto.
<p/>

<p>
The good old connections with Khaosan work here. How can it be that a ticket to Bangkok costs 600 baht, and to Pattaya - 1350, if a Bangkok-Pattaya ticket costs less than 100?

In Chiang Mai you can explore several temples (just enough for a few hours), one of them is truly unusual.

Chiang Mai has a million population, but it is not even close to Bangkok; rather, it can be put on a par with other provincial low-rise cities.

By the way, everything is very bad with city transport. There are as many as TWO bus routes for such a rather large city, which also run at huge intervals of 30 minutes. The owners of the minibuses that don’t even have numbers are dissatisfied. Due to the influx of tourists, drivers have already become insolent and will most likely refuse to take you at the standard rate of 20 baht (why, by the way, in Bangkok the fare is 6.50 without air conditioning and 13 with air conditioning, and in Chiang Mai 20 without air conditioning? The invisible hand of the market?).

Another life hack. If everything is bad, you can look for the nearest school. Even in the tourist ghetto there is a school, and there is cheap food near it, although only during the day, until the children go home.

<h2>Sukhothai</h2>
<p>
Sukhothai was the first capital of Thailand in the 13th to 15th centuries, before the rise of Ayutthaya. The remains of the ancient city are included in the UNESCO list.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255568151_f833ac22c9_o.jpg">
<p>
The modern city of Sukhothai was built 10 kilometers from the ancient one. I spent three days there, and for the first two I didn’t go anywhere, but sat in the room under a blanket in my jacket, trying not to get cold. Thailand was hit by a cyclone, causing the temperature to drop to a terrible level -  12 degrees. It even snowed somewhere in the mountains, but in Sukhothai it was just very cold and rainy. Like that:
