<h1>Palestine: Ramallah, Jerocho, Bethlehem, Hebron</h1>
<i>6-8 January 2014</i>
<h2>Hebron</h2>
<i>
The city and the ghetto. I want you to see the difference, and realize that it was naive to hope to defeat Britain through terrorism. You must know your enemy: it is not the people, but Britain itself, and it is against it that you must wage war!

Palestine is a semi-virtual state that wants a lot but has nothing. The entire territory of Palestine is divided into three parts, two of them are occupied by Israel (in whole or in part) and only one is under the control of the Palestinian authorities. This part consists of several large cities, while the roads are mostly controlled by Israel. Moreover, the State of Palestine has de facto two governments, one in Ramallah and the other in the Gaza Strip. The Palestinians have reached such misery after a series of epic failures in wars against the Jews, so now the Jews can build their settlements in the middle of Arab cities regardless of the opinion of the Palestinians. The harsh and cruel world once again shows that talk about “human rights” and “self-determination” is the lot of romantics and ideological revolutionaries. At the same time, Jews can sarcastically remark that even under the cruel occupation, Palestinians live better than most Arabs in free Arab states.

What is preventing peace in the Middle East? The main problem is resettlement. On the one hand, the Arabs expelled from Israeli territory will want their homes back. On the other hand, thousands of Jews live in so-called Jewish settlements in Palestine, and they are also not eager to leave. I looked at the Jewish settlements and I really don’t understand what makes them live there. What is the pleasure of living in a small town behind ten walls with barbed wire, driving everywhere with armed guards and provoking the hatred of millions of Arabs living around? But this is all from the point of view of an adequate person. It’s difficult to call some of these guys adequate.

The biggest evil and the source of much of the problems in the world is religion. Religious fanatics are insane, they do not understand any arguments and are ready to make any crazy sacrifices for the sake of their sacred idol. Look at the large building on the left. This is the so-called "Tomb of the Patriarchs", the place where Adam and Eve are buried. A normal person, having learned this, will laugh at a funny hoax, but a religious fanatic will not react like that: “AAAAAAAAA THIS IS A GREAT MIRACLE OF GOD EVERYONE PRAY URGENTLY! HOW DARE THOSE DIRTY SAVEGES LIVE AROUND OUR SACRED PLACE! THROW THEM OUT OF THERE!!!”

During the Second Intifada in the early 2000s, the news was constantly talking about clashes in Hebron. Back then, everyone was sick of the news about Israel, and I didn’t follow it closely. The war actually happened somewhere here.

For now, the status quo remains in Palestine. There was one strong politician in Israel, Ariel Sharon, who, by a willful decision, demolished all the settlements in the Gaza Strip, leaving the local jihad lovers alone. And the indignation of the fanatics was enormous, and moderate Israeli politicians are unable to overcome the radical lobby in order to demolish settlements in the West Bank. In essence, the problem is being preserved. For the convenience of defense, the Jews built a wall around Palestine; the Arabs, to the best of their ability, fire at the nearest cities with homemade Qassam missiles. Terrorist attacks are happening significantly less often than in 2003, so that Israel has dropped from the front pages of the news.

The fact is that the Palestinians are clearly inclined to blame all their troubles on the Masons, Americans, reptilians and, of course, the damned Jews, in general, on anyone other than themselves.

The current government of Palestine does not need independence, because it is so nice to get both grants from the US/UN and material assistance from Israel at once.

It is not difficult for a tourist to get to Palestine. This state has no border controls, and the external borders are guarded by Israeli border guards. Israeli currency is used here. However, it is almost impossible for tourists to enter the Gaza Strip; the territory is tightly cordoned off by the army. When you go to the West Bank, there is usually no control. There are buses to Bethlehem near the Damascus Gate of Jerusalem, and a little further around the corner there are buses to Ramallah. You can drive to the wall and cross the border on foot, but then you cannot avoid inspection. When entering back into Israel, they usually check your passports, but if you don’t look Arab, no questions are asked. In general, no one checked anything with me, much less inspected my things, so if the terrorists were able to recruit a white foreigner, he could easily carry out a terrorist attack in Israel. Well, probably, there are no fools, and thank God.
Tourists in Palestine, with the exception of Bethlehem, are rare visitors, so those who have overcome fear will receive a warm welcome.

The main tourist city in Palestine is Bethlehem. Tourists are brought here by bus to see the site of the Nativity and the Star of Bethlehem.

The capital of Palestine is Jerusalem, but since Palestinian authority does not extend there, the administration sits in the city of Ramallah. All roads converge in a star at the central square, so the whole city is stuck in a traffic jam.
