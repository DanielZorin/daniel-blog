<h1>Estonia: Narva, Tallinn, Tartu, Voru</h1>
<i>23 July - 6 August 2006</i>
<h2>Narva</h2>
<p>
In the summer of 2006, I went to Estonia for the International Olympiad in Linguistics, already in the status of a former schoolchild and future student. At first, our team was in the town of Narva-Jõesuu for about a week on the border with Russia near the beach, there was a linguistic school there together with the St. Petersburg team. Then we moved to Tartu - the second city of Estonia, where the Olympics themselves took place. We visited Tallinn twice - once we traveled from Narva, the second time on the last day before leaving for Moscow (we went there and back by train). We went to Narva several times - it was close, and there were all sorts of shops there. It’s interesting that in 2006 the main store in Narva looked like a Soviet supermarket, and when I got there 10 years later, there were already many modern shopping centers there. Narva central square and bank:

On a free day (when the jury checked the work) we were taken on a tour of the south-eastern part of Estonia, near the city of Võru.

<a href="../estonia">10 years later</a> I wondered if there were high-rises in the distance in 2006? As it turns out, they were.
