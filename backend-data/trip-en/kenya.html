<h1>Kenya: Kisumu, Nakuru, Nairobi, Mombasa, Voi</h1>
<i>21-26 July 2024</i>
<h2>Kisumu</h2>
<p>
Kisumu is the third largest city in Kenya, located near Lake Victoria. This is the first large city on the way if you are coming from Uganda.

The border with Uganda does not look nice. In the minibus they wanted to charge me 2000 shillings when the real price was about 600-700. I bargained down to 1000. I have not had such troubles in Africa before.

It feels like this country is richer. The houses in the villages are more respectable.
<p/>

<p>
And in many villages there are some restaurants, hairdressers and other businesses.

Intercity minibuses in Kenya are called shuttle (city ones are "matatu"). There are good shuttles here, where everyone has a separate seat, and they don't cram as many people as they physically can.

The railway. Trains to Kisumu go about once a week, but it seems that a full-fledged new railway to Uganda and Rwanda is gradually being built.
<p/>

Some warehouses. Right behind them is the shore of Lake Victoria. But in the center there is nowhere to go to the shore.

<h2>Nakuru</h2>
<p>
Nakuru is a fairly large city between Kisumu and Nairobi. I was immediately impressed by the many modern supermarkets and shopping centers here, which I had not seen in previous countries.
<p/>

In Nakuru, I tried nyama choma, the main Kenyan dish, for the first time. In one small area there were several restaurants serving this grill.
<p/>

<h2>Lake Nakuru</h2>
<p>
I came to Nakuru because there is a national park nearby, literally 5 kilometers from the city center. Where else can you find a park where you don't have to drive for several hours? Well, maybe near Nairobi, but there are fewer animals there. The entrance costs $60, but the main problem is transport - I was unable to join a group, so this safari turned out to be the most expensive of all. 
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946439050_e512241f1f_h.jpg" >

<h2>Nairobi</h2>
<p>
The capital of Kenya is quite an interesting city, but I was there at an unfortunate time. There were protests in Kenya against tax reform and against President William Ruto in general. About a month before my arrival, the protests were so violent that a couple dozen people died in battles with the police! The reform was cancelled, but the protests continued anyway. And on the day that I was going to Nairobi, a protest was planned. The day before, I was advised not to go to Nairobi, that it was not a fact that I would even be able to get to the center. But I did not want to waste a whole day, and it was also unclear how to bypass Nairobi, so I decided to go. At worst, I would just go somewhere to the outskirts and look for a hotel there.
<p/>

They're building high-rise buildings here, the architecture is similar to Russia, but there are far fewer floors.

Contrary to fears, the minibus reached its final destination - a small area north of the business center, where minibuses park on different streets for different destinations. It looks something like this:
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945081052_12d5260554_h.jpg" >
<p>
They say this is a less safe part of the city compared to the business center, although it seems like a lot of people walk here during the day. On that day, on the contrary, you could get here, but the business center was cordoned off by the police.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946439970_295eb0cc4e_h.jpg" >

I checked into a normal hotel for only 1000 shillings ($7).

<p>
I still wanted to see the city a little, so I called a taxi to go to the main cathedral (it's just at the exit from the center on the other side of me, outside the protest zone). The driver asked for more money than in the app, but it was okay, considering that he had to make a big detour.

<p>
While I was thinking about what to do next, compassionate Kenyans were very worried about me and advised me to go back to the hotel, which I eventually did, calling another taxi. This time the taxi driver unexpectedly drove through the central streets, it turned out that not all of them were blocked by the police. 
<p/>

It was somehow empty, all the shops were closed so that the windows would not be broken. But the motorcycle taxi drivers are okay, they chill on the corners.

<h2>Train ride</h2>
<p>
In Kenya, thanks to the efforts of Chinese investors, the railway was modernized, and now passenger trains run between Nairobi and Mombasa. I wouldn't say they are high-speed - they cover 500 kilometers in 6 hours. But it's definitely faster than a bus, not to mention the comfort. The only problem is buying a ticket, since payment is only through a Kenyan mobile phone via the M-Pesa system. But I managed, and in the morning I arrived at the train station. The station is very far from the center, even further than the airport.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946242793_4509f587dd_h.jpg" >
<p>
Security measures are serious - before we got to the ticket office, we were all sniffed by dogs. In the ticket office, you can print out a ticket from a machine, I also bought a return ticket (you can pay by card here, but not cash).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946439840_572a698f65_h.jpg" >

The tickets look exactly like in China.

On the second day I wanted to go to the beach. The weather, however, was not suitable for this, but what could I do. I decided to go not by taxi, but by minibus, since there was nowhere to hurry, and I wanted to remember the old days and ride hardcore. Kenyan minibuses are called "matatu".
<p/>

<p>
This is a very uncomfortable transport, worse than a marshrutka. You have to bend over to get there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946243658_8c4583443b_h.jpg" >
<p>
But it's interesting to look at the coloring. In fact, not all minibuses are so colorful, half are ordinary. But I stood on the street for about 40 minutes making a collection of photos of minibuses, since all the pictures are different.

Let's get back to the trip to the beach. I got into a random minibus whose driver was calling to the area where the beach is. Alas, the minibus did not go along the shore, but along a large road a couple of kilometers from it. So at some crossroads I got off and changed to a minibus towards the shore. This is what the place looked like.
<p/>

There was a huge TV in the second minibus.

<p>
Most of the coastline is occupied by hotels with no through passage. But there is also a public passage to the beach. There is a brisk trade along the way.

It looks beautiful, although the low tide is strong and the seaweed is a bit of a hindrance.

<h2>Voi</h2>
<p>
After Mombasa I was going to Tanzania. There are no direct buses there, so I decided to go first to the city of Voi (on the main highway to Nairobi), and from there there is a branch road towards the Tanzanian border. And Voi is right on the railway, so I got there from Mombasa in comfort.
<p/>

The station is again far from the center, although the city is small.

The road to Tanzania mostly goes through the Tsavo West National Park. Even from the minibus I saw some animals from afar, including elephants (though I didn’t have time to take a photo).
