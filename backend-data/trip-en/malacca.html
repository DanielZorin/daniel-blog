<h2>Malacca</h2>
<p>
Malacca is one of my favorite cities in Southeast Asia. I hung out there for quite a long time and saw a lot of interesting things. Malacca is beautiful, diverse and welcoming.

<p>
The owners of the hotel where I lived taught me how to have a proper night snack in Malay style: you need to go to an Indian eatery, fortunately it is open 24 hours a day, and get roti canai pancakes with teh tarik sweet tea. The roti comes with a slightly spicy sauce for dipping.
<p/>

<p>
Restaurant menu. Tea costs 1.40, roti - 1.20.
<p/>

<p>
On the next corner is the place where I ate lunch every day - a Chinese eatery. It only worked during the day and closed in the evening.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257152784_09ffdccba1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The dishes are authentic, just like in China. They cost about 7-8 ringit.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255676412_530a56b71c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The area where the hotel was located consists of new buildings like this.
<p/>

<p/>

<p>
You can climb onto the road bridge and look at the surroundings.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257448515_63b67c1871_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also an observation tower with a rotating platform.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257823945_af1c359f6d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a large shopping center nearby with a Giant supermarket and a food court that serves cendol - sweet shaved ice.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255676532_5815e7e61d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Malacca was Portuguese, Dutch and English. The Portuguese built their fortress on a hill.
<p/>

<p>
Now all that remains is the walls.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255675137_9dd5100a40_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And several buildings around.
<p/>

View from the top.
<p/>

<p>
There is also an old gate.

<p>
What remained from the Dutch is the main square with recognizable colors, like the houses in Amsterdam.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255675657_de1604182e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are incredibly kitschy auto rickshaws hanging around this square.

The rest was built under the British.

<p>
This cathedral too, although it looks more like a Portuguese one, and was commissioned by a French priest.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257152009_8a079e0a62_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The tourist area of Malacca is quite quiet.
<p/>

<p>

<p/>

Many Chinese temples.

In the evening they dance to “Xiao Pingguo” at a local club.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257152604_ec2b13d8e6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Only on weekends there is a market on Jonker street.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257152634_49697c6ea9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
By the way, there is a durian shop on it, which really only had ice cream and candies with durian due to the low season.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256406546_3e0d44c60a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
What kind of T-shirts are they selling here?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255676307_331a6fad63_h.jpg"/>
<p>
What does a Muslim princess look like?
<p/>

<p>
Street sign.

<p>
The embankment in Malacca, unlike Kuala Lumpur, looks nice.
<p/>

<p>

<p/>

Especially in the evening.

<p>
Does the slogan remind you of anything? The state of <a href="../texas">Texas</a> has exactly the same one. Also the flags of Texas and Malacca have the same colors.

<p>
During my week in Malacca, I explored several unusual places. The first is the construction site of New Malacca. Judging by the poster at the entrance, a new Dubai was to be built here on an artificial island. But something went wrong...
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256604898_63d314aeac_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The road here starts from the center along the coastal highway.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256407091_5b0b770cf8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
From there there is an exit to the bridge. The bridge is wide, but there are not a lot of cars.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257153229_b6ff033fc4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Behind the bridge, instead of skyscrapers, you can see an ordinary residential area.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256604923_0731ef6043_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But almost all the houses are empty.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255676947_c82b8cac63_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Since the houses are empty, there are no cars or trade.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255676967_c51a52fbc8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The parking lot is empty.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257449160_59e8174496_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The central square is empty.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256605178_8d6db6a79b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Even the alley where the trash cans are placed is sterile.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257153399_020d9988b1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Water tower on a vacant lot.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256605153_9f2591c704_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Oh, the "for sale" sign.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256982388_122d8ec657_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Oh, the semblance of a working canteen.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257448975_2d9d298954_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The only living place on the island is a large mosque. Tourist groups are brought here by bus.
<p/>

<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257528124_7414ec30db_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The mosque stands directly above the sea.
<p/>

<p>
“Pay Zakat” - we are reminded of one of the five pillars of Islam.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257449020_390327a345_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The angular worker is the only inhabitant of this area. Judging by Wikipedia, the plan is to open something as early as 2018, but no skyscrapers are visible yet.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256407121_59381caa20_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Another failed project is the monorail. This amounts to one of the biggest failures in history: the monorail broke down on opening day in 2010 and was closed shortly after.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255675437_37b8dc3539_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You can look at the abandoned line.
<p/>

<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257527919_c80d7132ee_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The place as a whole is quite lively, although not close to the historical center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255675542_da6a2e165a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On the eastern outskirts of Malacca, the 18th century Dutch fortress (St John's Fort) is perfectly preserved.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256604683_9805ac590c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Not a soul around.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256604733_5c169f8fc5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And inside too.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255676802_37ff7507f5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The guns do not look at the sea, but towards the land, because they were more afraid of an attack by aborigines from the mainland than by Europeans from the sea.
<p/>

View of the surrounding area.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257448775_bcb228fd1b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a water tower near the fort.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256604758_263ee49450_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And there is a poster about what is best for the heart.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256982333_a74e98ccfc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the east of Malacca there is an area called the "Portuguese village". The descendants of the Portuguese colonists live there, Malays, but Catholics, and even with their own language - a mixture of Malay and Portuguese.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257448000_ca9e8a7b47_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Overall this place looks like any other area.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256406331_20cf064df6_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255676062_d50416ee3b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But if you look closely, everyone has crosses hanging in their courtyards and at their doors and statues of Mary.

<p>
Many of the tombstones on it are unusual. Someone set up a ship.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256603568_ffc9984a16_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Someone has a whole castle.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256603513_edbbcbea2c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And someone copied the central square of Malacca.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255675367_a0cc94f102_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The top of the hill is an excellent viewpoint.

<h2>Taman Negara</h2>
<p>
There is only one national park in continental Malaysia and it is simply called "National Park", in Malay: Taman Negara. From Kuala Lumpur you first need to drive three hours inland to the city of Jerantut, then either an hour by bus or by boat on the river. I checked into a hotel in Jerantut and arrived by the first bus at 7 am.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256351094_1a4176bf2f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It was still cool and foggy at this early hour. The bus arrives at the village of Kuala Tahan, the park starts on the other side of the river, where you can take a boat for 1 ringgit. The entrance fee to the park is a nominal 1 ringgit (1/4 dollar).
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255807333_2372150f4d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Near the entrance there are many bungalows for rent; luggage is lifted to them on a special trolley on rails.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256647615_a46f4a7bc2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The park's territory is many square kilometers, the vast majority of which is inaccessible jungle. The original idea was that the park preserves the rainforest, unlike other areas, which in Malaysia have largely been converted into palm plantations. Don't expect any spectacular scenery, but if you've never been to a tropical rainforest, this is one of the most accessible places in Southeast Asia.
If you are not ready to go on a multi-day hike with a tent, then you can walk along several equipped routes through the forest.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254872242_9d9aea70b9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
For the most part, these are pathways like this. There is a thick layer of wet leaves on the ground, making it uncomfortable to walk on.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256351144_dda68b5aff_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At 7 am there were no people at all. After a couple of hours, groups arrived, but only to the main path along the river, from the entrance in an easterly direction. If you go from the entrance along the track to the north, or turn off the main path deeper towards the hill, there is no one there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257886860_dc440f58c8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In some places there are gazebos, even two-story ones, made for shelter in case of rain and for overnight stays.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255807493_6804300608_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Cicadas sing loudly in the forest and you can periodically hear monkeys jumping in the upper levels of the trees.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255602356_ac7299c6dc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In general, there are various animals in the park, even hornbills, but it is unlikely to meet anyone on a short walk. I only met a flying lizard.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255807768_d4d86dd8a3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And a lot of giant ants.
<p/>

<p>

<p/>

<p>
Little ones too.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256648565_57578f9a3e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The most unusual plant is this orchid.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254872507_2488def2ab_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It looks like salacca.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256648065_5567af3da4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Mushrooms.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255807463_ab71a60a0f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the depths of the park there is a Canopy Walkway - a rope path suspended from the tops of trees.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256648265_e6b27915fb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
From here you can look at the forest from above.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256648455_b8dd3ae43f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
After Canopy you can go even higher up the hill.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255808138_4e588a3258_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The fog began to dissipate, and it was possible to look around the surroundings.
<p/>

<p/>

<p>
There are no bridges here, you are already walking on the ground.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257886970_bfe291c900_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Having completed almost all the routes, I returned to the confluence of the rivers. There was no more fog, the sun was hot.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254873147_b01cc9c2bb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the restaurant on the pier you can have a delicious meal at normal prices of $1.5-2.5 per dish. By evening I had already returned to Jerantut.

<h2>Jerantut</h2>
<p>
Jerantut is a small town in the outback of Malaysia. What remains from the British is a clock tower and rows of houses from the first half of the 20th century.
<p/>

The years of construction are written on the facades.

<p>
At a local hotel, an excellent spacious room with air conditioning costs $9.
<p/>

<p>
I even stayed here three nights instead of the two nights needed to visit the national park, just to get some work done.
<p/>

<p>
All three days I tasted different dishes from a nearby restaurant. Meat with vegetables in sweet sauce.
<p/>

<p>
There is every benefit of civilization in the city. Opposite my hotel there was a big supermarket where you could buy all sorts of groceries, vegetables, and fruits. Most of all I remember a large pack of chocolate medals, which I then ate for 10 days, but later did not see for sale in other cities.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256427158_85a9ad7a7a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are also 7-11 and KFC. 7-11 is open 24 hours a day, so you won't be left without a serving of noodles.

There is a railroad in this wilderness. Malaysia has two branches, one goes along the coast, where the main cities are, the second through the center of the peninsula, connecting with the Thai network near Kota Bharu. In 2015, this second line was undergoing major reconstruction; no trains were running.
<p/>

Like in Thailand, in Malaysia, photographs of cancerous tumors are printed on cigarette packs.

<h2>Tanah Rata</h2>
<p>
Cameron Highlands is one of the most beautiful places in peninsular Malaysia. Unlike the coast, it is not hot here and air conditioning is not needed. I recommend coming here on weekdays - hotels are half the price. I was in the rainy season in October, because of this, every day around noon it started pouring rain and continued until the evening. Therefore, all trips moved to early morning.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255257137_0278d278ef_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In total I made three relatively small trips. It all starts in the town of Tanah Rata.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255985741_1552326830_h.jpg"/>

It starts south of Tanah Rata.

<p>
At the waterfall there is a power station and transformers are securely closed from outsiders.

<p>
And this is the path. At first it looks civilized.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255985846_d04c0062b0_h.jpg"/>

But then it gets more interesting.

<p>
In the end it almost completely disappeared. At that moment a field was visible to the side, I decided to try to go down through it. I had to jump from the bushes from a small height, as a result I slipped on the wet ground and got dirty in the mud.
<p/>

<p>
The adventures continue. While I was walking along the road, a car skidded right in front of me, it crashed into a concrete pillar and almost demolished it, the electrical wires began to smoke threateningly. Fortunately, both I and the girl driver of the car escaped unscathed. Soon a tow truck arrived.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256187278_2581de66b7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Soon after this I reached the main road.

It started to rain, so I had to run from shelter to shelter until it stopped. After some time, I reached the highlight of the program - tea plantations. The rain stopped for a while.
<p/>

Before this, I was at a tea plantation in <a href="../shanghai">Hangzhou</a>, but this one is more picturesque.

From the tea plantations you can walk back to Tanah Rata in about 40 minutes.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255986536_024aaaa38a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
For dinner I usually went to Indian places. For two dollars you can eat infernal-looking tandoori chicken.

On my second trek, I decided to climb Gunung Brinchang Hill. From Tanah Rata to the town of Brinchang you can walk along the highway (5 kilometers), but I took track number 4 instead.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256736254_7e7b0ce934_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is a very simple and short trek through the forest.
<p/>

In the Cameron Highlands, strawberries are grown everywhere in greenhouses. You can collect it in the garden for money. In Tanah Rata, I bought two boxes for 10 ringit ($2.5), about $5 per kilogram.
<p/>

Brinchang city. The trek up the hill begins from here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257030525_64b6305414_h.jpg"/>
<p>
When I got to the track, it started to rain heavily. For some time I took refuge in the gazebo, but the hope that the rain would end quickly faded, and besides, walking through the forest after the rain is a dubious pleasure.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257030660_eb7e915aef_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I went to KFC to dry off.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256187968_bfc45e12e7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There at that time a banquet was served for a large group of schoolchildren.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255257657_64046faa5f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
So I came back empty-handed. The next day I was determined to climb some hill early in the morning before the rain started, but I didn’t want to go back to Brinchang for more than 5 kilometers, so I chose Gunung Jasar Hill (Track 10). The desired hill is on the left in the distance. At first I spent a long time looking for the entrance to the track, trying to cut through the area in the foreground, but I couldn’t find it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257030690_68a152a327_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I had to take a detour back to the highway.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255257747_0818182e03_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There the passage was already noticeable.

<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257769850_bec68452c9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The climb is not difficult, the path is well trodden.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255257792_b085521e4e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And here I am at the top, right under the power line support! I wonder when they built it, did everyone carry it by hand through the forest?
<p/>

Then clouds began to fly into the panorama.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256188213_308a7c1899_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It smelled like rain, and I really didn’t want to end up in the forest under a tropical downpour, especially since I forgot my umbrella at the hotel.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255987256_4b5512067b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I quickly and decisively galloped down.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256928148_210f298cca_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I took a shortcut on the way back! This is the descent/ascent that I unsuccessfully searched for earlier.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255257977_f6d9612903_h.jpg"/>
<p>
No wonder I didn't notice it behind that barn. Climbing up this path is generally problematic, there is a thick layer of leaves there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255258017_c584a2cdc0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Judging by the time stamps of the photographs, the journey from the top to the bottom took exactly 30 minutes. Another half hour later I was sitting in a cafe with delicious spicy noodles and watching the downpour begin.

Muar City is the seat of the Sultan of Johor. It is located exactly at the opposite end of the state from the largest city of Johor Bahru.

<h2>Johor Bahru</h2>
<p>
In Malaysia, prices are on average three times lower than in Singapore, so it is not surprising that there is a large flow of pedestrians at the border. The most desirable things - cigarettes and alcohol - cannot be brought back to Singapore without customs duty in any volume, but no one bothers you to drink in Malaysia and at the same time buy food. The border terminal is a whole multi-level city with shops, a bus station, and a railway.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256986424_b31dd636f2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Car parking is very important for Malays. You shouldn't go to Singapore by car. Interestingly, bus travel across the border is three times cheaper if you buy a ticket in Malaysia for Malayan currency - if you are coming from this side, you should buy a round-trip ticket.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257280390_bf1872058e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Johor is certainly not Singapore. In general, this is probably the most unpleasant and dirty city in all of Malaysia - easy money corrupts. The entire center is an endless construction site and a heap of unknown things. There is really no public transport.

<h2>Seremban</h2>
<p>
In Malaysia, nine state monarchies take turns delegating their ruler to the position of head of state. Eight of them are ruled by dynasties, and the ninth is Malaysia in miniature, the state consists of nine parts, each with its own influential families, and the head of the state is chosen from among them. The state is called “Nine States”, Negeri Sembilan. The largest city in this state is called Seremban.

<h2>Ipoh</h2>
<p>
Like Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh grew out of a small settlement where tin was mined in the late 19th century.

Perak was the last state in Malaysia that I visited. I soon moved to Indonesia, so I couldn’t stay in Ipoh, but in general this city is well worth a few days - in addition to the historical center, there is a lot of beautiful karst around, which can be seen from the highway.

Where there is no karst, palm trees grow along the highway throughout Malaysia. Palm oil is made from them.

There is quite a lot of colonial architecture left in Ipoh - less than in Penang, but more than in the average Malay town. Here is the train station. Ipoh is almost the only city in Malaysia where it might make sense to go by train, however, the bus is still more convenient - 30% cheaper and runs to KL several times an hour, rather than once every two hours. Also, all tickets were sold out on the day of departure. The train is really faster, and the stations are in the city center.

Tourism is being developed in Ipoh. As in the more famous Georgetown, they made paintings on the walls and an installation, and created a map of the area so that they could be collected.
