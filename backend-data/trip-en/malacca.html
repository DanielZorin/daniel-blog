<h2>Malacca</h2>
<p>
Malacca is one of my favorite cities in Southeast Asia. I hung out there for quite a long time and saw a lot of interesting things. Malacca is beautiful, diverse and welcoming.

<p>
The owners of the hotel where I lived taught me how to have a proper night snack in Malay style: you need to go to an Indian eatery, fortunately it is open 24 hours a day, and get roti canai pancakes with teh tarik sweet tea. The roti comes with a slightly spicy sauce for dipping.
<p/>

Restaurant menu. Tea costs 1.40, roti - 1.20.

<p>
On the next corner is the place where I ate lunch every day - a Chinese eatery. It only worked during the day and closed in the evening.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257152784_c45af20550_o.jpg">
<p>
The dishes are authentic, just like in China. They cost about 7-8 ringit.
<p/>

<p>
The area where the hotel was located consists of new buildings like this.

You can climb onto the road bridge and look at the surroundings.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257448515_bdba584341_o.jpg">
<p>
There is also an observation tower with a rotating platform.
<p/>

<p>
There is a large shopping center nearby with a Giant supermarket and a food court that serves cendol - sweet shaved ice.
<p/>

Malacca was Portuguese, Dutch and English. The Portuguese built their fortress on a hill.

Now all that remains is the walls.

What remained from the Dutch is the main square with recognizable colors, like the houses in Amsterdam.

By the way, there is a durian shop on it, which really only had ice cream and candies with durian due to the low season.

Does the slogan remind you of anything? The state of <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/380342.html">Texas</a> has exactly the same one. Also the flags of Texas and Malacca have the same colors.

During my week in Malacca, I explored several unusual places. The first is the construction site of New Malacca. Judging by the poster at the entrance, a new Dubai was to be built here on an artificial island. But something went wrong...
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256604898_8c166b12f8_o.jpg">
<p>
The road here starts from the center along the coastal highway.
<p/>

<p>
From there there is an exit to the bridge. The bridge is wide, but there are not a lot of cars.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257153229_2c80906bd3_o.jpg">
<p>
Behind the bridge, instead of skyscrapers, you can see an ordinary residential area.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256604923_8dfc56e0de_o.jpg">
<p>
But almost all the houses are empty.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255676947_836e4b371b_o.jpg">
<p>
Since the houses are empty, there are no cars or trade.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255676967_0266999c86_o.jpg">

Even the alley where the trash cans are placed is sterile.

The only living place on the island is a large mosque. Tourist groups are brought here by bus.

“Pay Zakat” - we are reminded of one of the five pillars of Islam.

The angular worker is the only inhabitant of this area. Judging by Wikipedia, the plan is to open something as early as 2018, but no skyscrapers are visible yet.

Another failed project is the monorail. This amounts to one of the biggest failures in history: the monorail broke down on opening day in 2010 and was closed shortly after.
<p/>

On the eastern outskirts of Malacca, the 18th century Dutch fortress (St John's Fort) is perfectly preserved.
<p/>

The guns do not look at the sea, but towards the land, because they were more afraid of an attack by aborigines from the mainland than by Europeans from the sea.

In the east of Malacca there is an area called the "Portuguese village". The descendants of the Portuguese colonists live there, Malays, but Catholics, and even with their own language - a mixture of Malay and Portuguese.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257448000_e2301a2392_o.jpg">

<h2>Taman Negara</h2>
<p>
There is only one national park in continental Malaysia and it is simply called "National Park", in Malay: Taman Negara. From Kuala Lumpur you first need to drive three hours inland to the city of Jerantut, then either an hour by bus or by boat on the river. I checked into a hotel in Jerantut and arrived by the first bus at 7 am.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256351094_ac006db7f9_o.jpg">
<p>
It was still cool and foggy at this early hour. The bus arrives at the village of Kuala Tahan, the park starts on the other side of the river, where you can take a boat for 1 ringgit. The entrance fee to the park is a nominal 1 ringgit (1/4 dollar).
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255807333_9821f96f2f_o.jpg">
<p>
Near the entrance there are many bungalows for rent; luggage is lifted to them on a special trolley on rails.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256647615_0ed211c95c_o.jpg">
<p>
The park's territory is many square kilometers, the vast majority of which is inaccessible jungle. The original idea was that the park preserves the rainforest, unlike other areas, which in Malaysia have largely been converted into palm plantations. Don't expect any spectacular scenery, but if you've never been to a tropical rainforest, this is one of the most accessible places in Southeast Asia.
If you are not ready to go on a multi-day hike with a tent, then you can walk along several equipped routes through the forest.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254872242_5587bb5517_o.jpg">
<p>
For the most part, these are pathways like this. There is a thick layer of wet leaves on the ground, making it uncomfortable to walk on.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256351144_30e05c2947_o.jpg">
<p>
At 7 am there were no people at all. After a couple of hours, groups arrived, but only to the main path along the river, from the entrance in an easterly direction. If you go from the entrance along the track to the north, or turn off the main path deeper towards the hill, there is no one there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257886860_126efaae94_o.jpg">
<p>
In some places there are gazebos, even two-story ones, made for shelter in case of rain and for overnight stays.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255807493_9424457dee_o.jpg">

Cicadas sing loudly in the forest and you can periodically hear monkeys jumping in the upper levels of the trees.

In general, there are various animals in the park, even hornbills, but it is unlikely to meet anyone on a short walk. I only met a flying lizard.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255807768_a43f449f9d_o.jpg">

In the depths of the park there is a Canopy Walkway - a rope path suspended from the tops of trees.
<p/>

In the restaurant on the pier you can have a delicious meal at normal prices of $1.5-2.5 per dish. By evening I had already returned to Jerantut.

<h2>Jerantut</h2>
<p>
Jerantut is a small town in the outback of Malaysia. What remains from the British is a clock tower and rows of houses from the first half of the 20th century.

I even stayed here three nights instead of the two nights needed to visit the national park, just to get some work done.

There is every benefit of civilization in the city. Opposite my hotel there was a big supermarket where you could buy all sorts of groceries, vegetables, and fruits. Most of all I remember a large pack of chocolate medals, which I then ate for 10 days, but later did not see for sale in other cities.
<p/>

There are also 7-11 and KFC. 7-11 is open 24 hours a day, so you won't be left without a serving of noodles.

There is a railroad in this wilderness. Malaysia has two branches, one goes along the coast, where the main cities are, the second through the center of the peninsula, connecting with the Thai network near Kota Bharu. In 2015, this second line was undergoing major reconstruction; no trains were running.

<h2>Tanah Rata</h2>
<p>
Cameron Highlands is one of the most beautiful places in peninsular Malaysia. Unlike the coast, it is not hot here and air conditioning is not needed. I recommend coming here on weekdays - hotels are half the price. I was in the rainy season in October, because of this, every day around noon it started pouring rain and continued until the evening. Therefore, all trips moved to early morning.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255257137_9cff7cb30a_o.jpg">
<p>
In total I made three relatively small trips. It all starts in the town of Tanah Rata.

In the end it almost completely disappeared. At that moment a field was visible to the side, I decided to try to go down through it. I had to jump from the bushes from a small height, as a result I slipped on the wet ground and got dirty in the mud.

The adventures continue. While I was walking along the road, a car skidded right in front of me, it crashed into a concrete pillar and almost demolished it, the electrical wires began to smoke threateningly. Fortunately, both I and the girl driver of the car escaped unscathed. Soon a tow truck arrived.

On my second trek, I decided to climb Gunung Brinchang Hill. From Tanah Rata to the town of Brinchang you can walk along the highway (5 kilometers), but I took track number 4 instead.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256736254_c03e36c93e_o.jpg">

<p>
When I got to the track, it started to rain heavily. For some time I took refuge in the gazebo, but the hope that the rain would end quickly faded, and besides, walking through the forest after the rain is a dubious pleasure.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257030660_054d410562_o.jpg">

<p>
So I came back empty-handed. The next day I was determined to climb some hill early in the morning before the rain started, but I didn’t want to go back to Brinchang for more than 5 kilometers, so I chose Gunung Jasar Hill (Track 10). The desired hill is on the left in the distance. At first I spent a long time looking for the entrance to the track, trying to cut through the area in the foreground, but I couldn’t find it.
<p/>

<h2>Johor Bahru</h2>
<p>
In Malaysia, prices are on average three times lower than in Singapore, so it is not surprising that there is a large flow of pedestrians at the border. The most desirable things - cigarettes and alcohol - cannot be brought back to Singapore without customs duty in any volume, but no one bothers you to drink in Malaysia and at the same time buy food. The border terminal is a whole multi-level city with shops, a bus station, and a railway.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256986424_3d54a1cac2_o.jpg">
<p>
Car parking is very important for Malays. You shouldn't go to Singapore by car. Interestingly, bus travel across the border is three times cheaper if you buy a ticket in Malaysia for Malayan currency - if you are coming from this side, you should buy a round-trip ticket.
<p/>

Johor is certainly not Singapore. In general, this is probably the most unpleasant and dirty city in all of Malaysia - easy money corrupts. The entire center is an endless construction site and a heap of unknown things. There is really no public transport.

<h2>Seremban</h2>
<p>
In Malaysia, nine state monarchies take turns delegating their ruler to the position of head of state. Eight of them are ruled by dynasties, and the ninth is Malaysia in miniature, the state consists of nine parts, each with its own influential families, and the head of the state is chosen from among them. The state is called “Nine States”, Negeri Sembilan. The largest city in this state is called Seremban.

<h2>Ipoh</h2>
<p>
Like Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh grew out of a small settlement where tin was mined in the late 19th century.

Perak was the last state in Malaysia that I visited. I soon moved to Indonesia, so I couldn’t stay in Ipoh, but in general this city is well worth a few days - in addition to the historical center, there is a lot of beautiful karst around, which can be seen from the highway.

There is quite a lot of colonial architecture left in Ipoh - less than in Penang, but more than in the average Malay town. Here is the train station. Ipoh is almost the only city in Malaysia where it might make sense to go by train, however, the bus is still more convenient - 30% cheaper and runs to KL several times an hour, rather than once every two hours. Also, all tickets were sold out on the day of departure. The train is really faster, and the stations are in the city center.

Tourism is being developed in Ipoh. As in the more famous Georgetown, they made paintings on the walls and an installation, and created a map of the area so that they could be collected.
