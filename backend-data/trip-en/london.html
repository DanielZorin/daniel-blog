<h1>United Kingdom: London</h1>
<i>24 September, 5 October 2014</i>
<h2>London</h2>
<p>
It is quite difficult to get a visa to the UK. For a person whose real income is much higher than the official one (and in Russia it's the majority of people who, in principle, have money for a trip to England), this involves coming up with all sorts of certificates and bank statements. In addition, the application process itself is organized disgracefully (the exact opposite of the organization of the <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/tag/usa">USA</a> embassy). Therefore, I postponed my trip to Britain until better times and was somewhat biased towards the country.
In July 2014, I visited <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/tag/romania">the last country</a> on the European continent, so when I wanted to go somewhere for fun for a week, the choice was Portugal. Tickets to this country are traditionally expensive, so I created a super-route Moscow-London-Porto   Lisbon-London-Moscow on easyJet and Ryanair airlines, which cost me a total of 200 euros. I selected my flights so that I had two full days in London, and managed to transit there visa free. Two months later, visa-free transit with access to the city in the UK was actually canceled.
By the way, I was in England 13 years ago at a summer school, we were then taken on a tour of the center of London, and from that time I miraculously kept an excellent map of the city.

From the former British colonies, I was in <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/tag/hong kong">Hong Kong</a>, <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com /tag/cyprus">Cyprus</a>, <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/tag/malta">Malta</a> and in the <a href="http://juan .livejournal.com/tag/usa">United States</a>. Now it becomes clear where many details there come from. For example, the inscription “look right” is in exactly the same font as in Hong Kong, only it is not duplicated in hieroglyphs.

A person who has visited London will certainly not be surprised why the British have “first floor” as the second floor, and the first floor is called “ground floor”. Exactly because the first floor of London houses is literally underground. I would call it a semi-basement.

The Americans' passion for hanging prohibition signs everywhere was left over from former colonists.

Anyone who parks in front of my house will be fined £100. I wonder if the owner can apply the pads himself? If not, then how will the policeman understand that it was someone who parked without permission, and not friends who came to visit the owner?

Street name signs bear the name of the area; different areas have different types of signs.

The richer and more prosperous a country is, the more people want to leave in search of a better life. Can you imagine advertisements on the streets of Moscow saying “Emigrate to Australia?”

However, England itself will not be left without a population; global businessmen will come there.

Despite the fact that the London Underground is the oldest in the world, most stations and tunnels look like spaceship passages.

Travel is very expensive, one trip around the city center costs 2 pounds and 20 pence.

<p>
Only at some stations it looks like the old days. There is always some kind of work going on in the London Underground; some lines are closed on weekends. There are boards at the entrance showing which lines have which train delays.

Sometimes things like this happen, but in general the transport runs smoothly for such a big city.

Funnily enough, in London there are minibuses, just like in Russia or Uzbekistan. Minibuses go purposefully to specific suburbs, mainly, of course, to those where not the most affluent people live. Southall is an area known as "little India".
<p/>

<p>
Some people don’t ride minibuses, but sleep right in the center.

The most striking feature of London is that the inside of telephone booths are papered with advertisements for prostitutes, just like in <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/248663.html">Rio de Janeiro</a>.

At first I thought this Chelsea-South Kensington area was a red light district because there were a suspiciously large number of small hotels and guesthouses there. But advertising can also be found in the very center of London, in the City and Westminster, including in classic red booths. But not all of them, apparently, are cleaned periodically.
<p/>

<p>
They don’t skimp on advertising; it is printed in color on glossy paper. They are attached with some kind of composition similar to chewing gum, so it is easy to remove. I collected a whole pack.

One day it was Sunday and Chelsea was playing. The streets around the stadium were blocked, and all the drinking establishments were packed.

Mounted police were there to keep order. Before the match everything was calm and peaceful.

Although there may be fights after the game. Judging by the fact that there are huge spikes on the fences of the houses around the stadium, just like in Latin American countries.

At first glance, London is a gray and gloomy city (especially when it rains, and it rains several times almost every day). But if you look closely, in London you can find chic places no worse than <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/267746.html">Bruges</a>, for example.

The residential areas around the center are built up with classic English houses.

Antique street sign. Last time in England I bought the game of Monopoly, the English version which uses the streets of London. I got used to it and remember all the names perfectly. This time I walked almost all of these streets, except for a few cheap ones that are not in the very center.

The main architectural feature of London, which distinguishes it from many other European cities, is that nothing is sacred here; no one is embarrassed by the idea of building a skyscraper in front of St. Paul's Cathedral or a Ferris wheel near Big Ben.

And this is what the panorama of London looks like, or, as they would say in America, the skyline. If it were not for the maritime college in the foreground, you would not be able to say that you are in Europe and not in the USA.

The view in the other direction, St Paul's Cathedral is barely visible, and the Shard, London's tallest building, is clearly visible on the left. They charge more than £20 for the climb up. This, by the way, is also common to England and America: entrance to some places costs a lot of money, but to others it’s completely free. You can go to the British Museum and the National Gallery for free.

In general, the North Greenwich area, which looks very dull, is now being actively built up with modern architecture.

On one side of the bridge stands the Parliament building, on the other - this is the view. I would guess at random that it is somewhere in China.

The area with skyscrapers is called Docklands. Until recently there were shipyards here, and now it is a business center.
