<h1>Italy: Treviso, Venice, Vicenza, Verona, Brescia, Milan</h1>
<i>19-20 January 2017</i>
<h2>Treviso</h2>
<p>
Treviso is the city where Venice airport is located (the one where low-cost airlines fly).

<h2>Venice</h2>
<p>
Venice is a city from which you expect the worst, because the ratio of the number of tourists to the number of residents and the city's area in square meters is probably the worst in the world. In fact, everything turned out to be much better than my expectations. January is the best time: there are not many people, housing prices are not so high - I stayed in a hostel in the very center a stone's throw from the Rialto Bridge for less than 15 euros (for comparison, the next day in Milan I did not find anything cheaper than 22 ). I can’t say about the prices for food, they are probably a little higher than the average for Italy (which are themselves high), but I saw several supermarkets even in the city center, so you won’t be hungry.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255902668_51467e22c6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Local residents traditionally hate tourists, just like the odious residents of <a href="../bilbao">Barcelona</a>. The logic of this is not clear to me. From my position as a tourist, it is really better that there are fewer other tourists on the central streets, and that the hotels are cheaper. But they get income from this! And no one forces them to go to restaurants on San Marco. Has housing become expensive? In any city that matters, housing is expensive, even in Mumbai. If you don’t like it, go to Bumfuck and work there for the minimum wage. Unfortunately, in Venice, due to its peculiarities, there will never be any work other than serving tourists: you can’t do either production or office there - there are no roads, the buildings are small and cramped.
<p/>

<p>
Too many people harm the city physically, so artificially limiting it makes sense.

<p>
Well, the majority of tourists are rednecks because the the majority of people are generally rednecks.

They make a lot of money from tourists in Venice. For example, for tourists it has perhaps the most expensive public transport in the world. The previous record was $6 for tram travel in <a href="../san-francisco">San Francisco</a>, but in Venice, shuttle boat fares are €7.50. For local residents, one trip costs 1.50, which is about the same as in other cities in Italy. A day pass for a tourist costs 20 euros. It makes sense to buy it if you want to go to the neighboring islands, and the city center can be easily explored on foot; between the farthest points it will be an hour and a half.

In Venice, entrance to absolutely all churches is paid, even far from the main streets.

<p>
Venice is an island divided into two parts by the Grand Canal. It lies at a decent distance from the mainland, but both trains and cars/buses can cross the bridge. There are several smaller islands near Venice. The nearby island of Giudecca is served by ferries back and forth from the main island, as well as public boats. On Giudecca, hotels and hostels are much cheaper than on the main island, but at the same time, on websites it is considered part of the “center”; if you make a mistake and book there, you will have to spend a lot of money on transport.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255699341_2ad7033b14_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Walking is quite normal if you have a navigator or a good map. The narrowest point is the crossing of the Grand Canal; there are only three bridges across it. Local residents actively use boats.

There are quite a lot of squares in Venice where you won’t even think that you are on an island.

But still, Venice is <i>really</i> a city of canals, there are really a lot of them here, in contrast to the numerous cities called “X-th Venice” with a couple of puny streams.

In Venice, there are unexpectedly many buildings with cracked facades, with peeling paint, like in Genoa or Naples. I think the location on the island and the high humidity play a role here.

When there were no tourists in Venice yet, and almost every self-respecting person had a boat, the main entrances to the houses were from the canals, and mostly beggars walked the streets. The rich facades are best seen on the main "street".

Previously, people used to navigate the canals on long gondola boats. Nowadays, the price of such a “taxi” is so prohibitive that it is difficult to consider them seriously as transport.

I think it’s a must to visit Venice with an overnight stay, even if it’s more expensive than spending the night on the mainland. Late in the evening you can enjoy all the sights almost in splendid isolation, even the most popular ones. The fact is that a very significant part of tourists are either people on bus excursions, who are taken in the evening to a hotel on the mainland, or cruisers who spend the night on the ship. There is no nightlife in Venice, so at 9-10 pm even the central streets are empty and the shops are closed. Let's go hunting!

<h2>Vicenza</h2>
<p>
Vicenza is an hour's drive from Venice. In winter there are almost no tourists here, in summer there are probably some, because Vicenza has several buildings built by the famous architect Antonio Palladio. First of all, the cathedral.

<h2>Verona</h2>
<p>
Everyone knows that Montagues and Capulets lived in Verona. The house where the family lived - the prototype of the Capulets - fell into disrepair for a long time, until tourists began to come to Verona. Then (in the 1930s) the famous Juliet balcony was attached to it.

People take photos in this yard even in the off-season.

In Verona, people are especially concerned about the problem of dogs walking in the wrong places; I found several advertisements close to each other, and all of them are different.

<h2>Brescia</h2>
<p>
A city between Milan and Verona.

<p>
What sets Brescia apart from other small Italian cities is the fact that it has a metro. Only in Italy could they build a metro in a city with a population of 200 thousand people. And not just one - there are equally lightly loaded metro systems in Catania, Perugia, Genoa, Turin, firmly established at the very bottom of the list of metro systems in the world in terms of the number of passengers per year. Russians and Italians are kindred spirits; it is not surprising that of all European leaders, Putin was best friends with Berlusconi.

Once again I was in Milan, and I couldn't go to the city center, so I was satisfied with the store.
