<h1>Germany: Stuttgart, Karlsruhe, Speyer, Mainz, Koblenz, Cologne, Aachen</h1>
<i>31 July - 2 August 2016</i>
<h2>Karlsruhe</h2>
<p>
After some time off, I found myself back in Germany - a country where it is so easy to visit so many cities in a very short trip, because train tickets are always purchased with full-day passes for the region or the entire country.
<p/>

<p>
At German train stations and in underground passages near large train stations there is always the recognizable smell of fresh baked goods from small bakeries and cafes.
<p/>

<p>
At train stations they sometimes put up toy model steam locomotives.

<p>
I was passing through the city of Karlsruhe for a short time. It is a scientific and industrial center and a train junction. The city has an unusual layout - there is a palace in the center, and exactly from it the streets run like rays at equal angles, crossing after a while a perfectly round ring road.

<h2>Stuttgart</h2>
<p>
I was lucky to be in the city of Stuttgart exactly on the day of the notorious “gay pride”, which they love to scare viewers of Russian television with. In Stuttgart the parade is not as big as in Berlin or Cologne, but the essence of the phenomenon is approximately the same.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256606115_58f811a15a_o.jpg">
<p>
In Germany, the pride is called CSD - Christopher Street Day, in memory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_Riots">Stonewall Riot</a>.
<p/>

<p>
The party took place on two main squares in the historical center of Stuttgart. On one they put a DJ console and set up a disco.

In general, the format is not very different from any other holiday, except that the entertainers are dressed specifically.

In addition, there were stands of various associations and businesses on similar topics on the streets. Here is the stand of the regional magazine "Schwulst".

Now let's look at Stuttgart itself. This is one of the largest cities in Germany, like most other huge cities, it was heavily destroyed during the war, so it has a strict modern appearance.

Germany has a travel pass that allows unlimited travel throughout the country on regional trains throughout the day. For two it costs 52 euros. So, in principle, you can cross the entire country, albeit with a large number of transfers. Well, I used this ticket to travel from Stuttgart to Aachen at the border with the Netherlands, about 700 kilometers, with transfers in the cities of Speyer, Mainz, Koblenz and Cologne.
</p>
<h2>Speyer</h2>
<p>
The city of Speyer is home to a World Heritage Site - the cathedral where the Holy Roman Emperors are buried.

<h2>Rhine Valley</h2>
<p>
One of the most beautiful places in Germany is the Rhine Valley; along the banks of the great river there are many knightly castles and old small towns preserved. The valley is located between the cities of Mainz and Koblenz. There is a railway along both banks of the Rhine, from which you can see the opposite bank quite well. Trains from Mainz to Koblenz run on the west coast approximately every hour, and on the east coast a little less frequently. It would be a good idea to set aside a whole day to get off at small stations along the way, otherwise the coast along which you are traveling is not really visible.

<h2>Cologne</h2>
<p>
I arrived in Cologne close to sunset. This was the fifth city that day, and the next day there were six more planned, so I didn’t go further than the famous cathedral, especially since it was not my <a href="../duesseldorf">first time here</a>.
<p/>

Fortunately, the cathedral is right opposite the station.

I sat inside for about 20 minutes and listened to the organ.

<h2>Aachen</h2>
<p>
Aachen was the capital of the empire of Charlemagne, who in 800 controlled an area roughly equivalent to modern-day Germany, France and Italy. It was the last major state in Western Europe after the Roman Empire; it is not surprising that it was later remembered with nostalgia for many centuries. In Aachen there is a cathedral where the emperor is buried.

It was raining that morning, which made walking around the city uncomfortable. I also wore sandals, since I had no other shoes since Malaysia, and it was a little cold.

Aachen is located near the border with Belgium and the Netherlands. There are buses to Maastricht, where I went.
