<h1>Cyprus: Nicosia, Limassol, Paphos</h1>
<i>27-31 December 2013</i>
<h2>Nicosia</h2>
<p>
Divided in two by occupation, Nicosia is the capital of both parts of Cyprus. The southern part is also full of abandoned buildings and blank walls, but the city has a European flair.

There are modern skyscrapers where offshore companies are in charge.

Cyprus is a fairly religious country, where the head of the local branch of the Orthodox Church plays an important role. This is his residence.

Nicosia is a million times better than Lefkosa, but the hotels here are expensive, because they are designed for businessmen, so you don’t want to linger here too much.

<h2>Limassol</h2>
<i>
For the first half of their lives, global orcs fight with each other for the right to leave Urkaina for London, and the second half - they sit in London and watch Urkaina's television. (Victor Pelevin "Snuff")</i>
<p>
Life is good, you were able to land a good job, made a fortune, you are rich and successful. You exchanged your shitty gray Khrushchev apartment for an apartment in Cyprus, and now you have everything: palm trees, blue sea, white yachts - well, you get the idea. But something goes wrong. It's so boring and sickening. You miss the familiar gloomy faces and rude voices, appearances by Dmitry Kiselev on TV and Stas Mikhailov on the radio, Olivier salad, Doshirak noodles and other traditional dishes of Russian cuisine, products written off from Europe for increased toxicity, and of course, beloved, understandable and beautiful Cyrillic alphabet. And at this moment THEY appear on the stage.

<p>
And prices are five times higher than in Russia. Well, for the love of the Motherland, don’t feel sorry!

The official language of Cyprus is Greek. But in reality, you still need to look for people who speak it.
</p>

<p>
To come across an inscription in Greek is a rare stroke of luck. The plaque illustrates well the position of the Greek language in Limassol.

<p>
In principle, this is logical. Advertising should be aimed at a potential solvent audience, to which the Greek Cypriots clearly do not belong after the crisis. The Arabs are, but the Greeks are not.

A business lunch for almost $20, by the standards of Moscow - a little expensive, by the standards of Cyprus - even more so (in general, it is cheaper there than in Moscow).

Even a taxi. Tell me, why do you need a taxi in Russian? Can’t live without “will you show me the way?” and trade like in an oriental bazaar?

I must say that there are also services in other languages, but much less.

If you need products at normal prices, you can turn to our brothers the Romanians and Bulgarians.

Apparently products from Romania are not subject to high tariffs. Or Romanian businessmen are less greedy.

Perhaps you will reproach me for the fact that in the story about Limassol I did not show anything interesting in the city except the signs. Sleep well: apart from signboards, there is nothing worthy of attention in the city. However, if you like lying on the beach under the scorching sun all day long (for me this is unbearable torture), then the conditions here are very decent. With the exception of the flight (to Turkey it's still cheaper), everything is quite cheap, the infrastructure is good and clean. The accommodation was a pleasant surprise - for 20 euros you can rent an excellent apartment.

<h2>Paphos</h2>
<p>
The city of Paphos is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List, apparently due to a misunderstanding. Take a look at this impressive place.

If this is included in the list, then every village in Italy can also be included; there are more than 9,000 such ruins there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257356274_08b2c0c514_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are several more ruins.
<p/>

<p>
In general, it's okay, but overhyped.
<p/>

So there is no point in going to Cyprus for history buffs.

Otherwise, it is the usual resort town.

For some reason, the only place where you can see an inscription in Greek in the resort of Cyprus is the stalls, which always say “PERIPTERO”
