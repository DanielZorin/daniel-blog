<h1>New Caledonia</h1>
<i>14-17 January 2020</i>
<p>
New Caledonia is the largest island in Oceania. It is an overseas territory of France that strives to secede - in 2018 there was a referendum on independence, in which they voted against, and in 2020 they are already promising a new one. The fact is that the local indigenous people - Melanesians - make up 45% of the population, while the French make up 55%, and all the French are against independence because they do not want to lose French subsidies and become another useless banana country in Oceania. The local airline Air Calin has a flight from Paris with a stopover in Tokyo, where I boarded the plane.

Caledonia is the Roman name for Scotland. Captain Cook named the island this way because of its similar mountainous terrain.

Most of New Caledonia consists of such mountains, almost all life is concentrated on the west coast, with only a few roads across the island.

From the airport to the capital of the island, the distance is 40 kilometers along the main highway. French distance indicator.

<p>
The highway is mostly single-lane, only wider closer to the capital. There is little traffic.

I was unable to rent a car in New Caledonia, since all rental offices required at least two years of experience, so I was not able to travel around the island outside the cities.

Let's look at Noumea, the capital of New Caledonia. There is not much colonial architecture here, but it does exist. Here, for example, is a customs building with typically French shutters.

<p>
The city center is small and laid out in a smooth grid pattern, typical of colonial cities. On the hill above it is the main cathedral, similar in shape to the Cathedral of <a href="../quebec">Montreal</a>.

Most of Noumea consists of private houses, I lived in this area:

If you get to the southern edge of the peninsula on which Noumea is located, you can climb a high hill.

The nature here is very reminiscent of Australia - prickly eucalyptus forests, rocks.

It is very hot, and at the same time dry, not like in Indonesia.

At the top, most of the hill is occupied by an actual military base, but there is also an observation point.

At the crossroads there is a monument - a piece of nickel ore. New Caledonia contains 10% of the world's nickel reserves; this is the main source of the country's export income - 80%.

The money of New Caledonia is called Pacific francs. It is also used in French Polynesia and the Wallis and Futuna Islands. Moreover, each of the three overseas territories mints coins with its own coat of arms, but they are also interchangeable, although for obvious reasons you can find New Caledonian coins in Tahiti much less often than Italian euros in France.

New Caledonia is a very expensive country, more expensive than Australia, New Zealand and the independent countries of Oceania. Chicken in the supermarket costs $13 per kilo with bones!
