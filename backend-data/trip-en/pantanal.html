<h1>Brazil: Cuiabá, Campo Grande, Bonito, Dourados</h1>
<i>9-17 May 2021</i>
<h2>Cuiabá</h2>
<p>
The city of Cuiabá is the capital of the state of Mato Grosso ("Big forest"), a huge inland state on the border with Bolivia. I flew there from Sao Paulo for just $20 to explore a little of this part of Brazil and visit the Pantanal.
<p/>

<p>
We are approaching the city. The terrain here is quite flat, although about 5 kilometers to the north there are small mountains, where I also went.
<p/>

<p>
All of Cuiaba is at your fingertips. More than 600 thousand people live here.

<p>
For the 2014 FIFA World Cup, plans were made to build a metrotram system in Cuiabá, including a line to the airport. As a result, they built a couple of kilometers near the airport and one station. Just like <a href="../siberia">Omsk metro</a>.
<p/>

The city turned out to be quite interesting. It recently celebrated its 300th anniversary, and there are a number of architectural monuments here.

<h2>Chapada dos Guimarães</h2>
<p>
Near Cuiaba there is the Chapada dos Guimarães National Park. I was in one chapada near the capital of Brazil. As I understand it, "chapadas" are flat-topped rocks, analogous to “mesas” in the USA. There is also a diamond chapada (Chapada Diamantina) in the state of Bahia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256037566_abddd941df_h.jpg"/>

<p>
I didn’t want to bother renting a car and took a bus to the city called Chapada dos Guimarães. Due to the pandemic, the frequency of buses has decreased sharply and they run at intervals of 2-3 hours.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256037536_35f87914b2_h.jpg"/>

<p>
In fact, apart from the views from the road, you can see quite little (even with a car); there is a national park, but there are almost no treks in it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257081470_071fe1e5fa_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is only one place near which I went out. Sign at the entrance to the park.
<p/>

In theory, the city should stand on the edge of the plateau, but I was not able to get to the edge, there is private territory and hotels everywhere.

<h2>Campo Grande</h2>
<p>
Campo Grande is the capital of the state of Mato Grosso do Sul. This is a city of over a million people, but not particularly remarkable, founded at the end of the 19th century.
<p/>

<h2>Bonito</h2>
<p>
Bonito is a small town in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, where ecotourism is very developed. The system here is very elaborate: you need to buy tickets to all places in advance, since the number of visitors per day is strictly limited (and now, due to the coronavirus, this norm has also been halved). Tickets are sold through travel agencies that have access to a unified computer reservation system. For some reason, there is no access there for ordinary people, so it is difficult to book something in advance - you need to contact a local travel agency by e-mail (for this you often need to know Portuguese). I didn’t book anything in advance, and bought everything on the first evening in Bonito, fortunately the travel agent was at the next table with the administrator of my hotel. In addition to tickets to the attractions themselves, you also need to book transport to them, since many are far away (50-70 km), and you cannot get there by bicycle. You can rent a car, but it is very expensive for 1-2 people; it is easier to buy a transfer from the same travel agency, especially since they always have enough free seats.
<p/>

<p>
So, what is there in Bonito? Firstly, snorkeling in rivers. This is the most expensive (but worthwhile) entertainment, costs around 200 reais (there are several different places, they differ slightly in prices)   transfer. Secondly, caves. Entrance price 40-80 reais. The most famous one, where tourism in Bonito began, is the Blue Lake (Gruta de Lago Azul), I was not able to get there, because... there were no places. There is also the Abismo Anhumas cave, also with a lake, where the entrance costs some unrealistic money - more than 1000 reais ($200, and a few years ago it was $500). How it deserved such a price, I still don’t understand; on <a href="../saipan">Saipan</a> for example you can dive in a similar cave much cheaper. Thirdly, swimming (called balneario, these are not hot springs, but swimming in the river   perhaps something like a water park). It's also not very expensive, the cheapest option is only 38 reais (for the whole day). Fourthly, trips to the Pantanal with safari, which I will talk about separately later. On the first day I was in the São Mateus cave, which is located near Bonito, only 4-5 kilometers from the center, so I walked there, at the same time seeing the city. The main street of Bonito consists of shops, restaurants and hotels.

It's like being in a small beach resort, but without the beach.

<p>
There is almost nothing outside the main street; even if there were restaurants, they were closed due to the pandemic. In fact, in the center, many restaurants were open only from Friday to Sunday.

Outside the city, the roads become dirt, you can see that the ground here is red, like in <a href="../paraguay">Paraguay</a>. By the way, Paraguay is not far from here, about three hours from the border. If it weren’t for the pandemic, I would have gone there for a day purely for fun.

In the afternoon I went snorkeling in the river. There are no photographs, because you can’t take anything with you - they bring you to one point and take you back several kilometers below (I didn’t have a camera that works underwater). The underwater world in the river is simply 10 out of 10, one of the best I have seen. Huge and varied fish are not as afraid of people as sea fish, but phlegmatically swim by. There is a chance to even see an anaconda in the river, but I was unlucky with that.
<p/>

On the third day I went to the Pantanal, and on the fourth I decided to relax on the river near Bonito. It was Sunday, so instead of the crowded public beach, I paid a couple dollars more for the lounge area at the big hotel next door.
<p/>

<h2>Pantanal</h2>
<p>
The Pantanal is a huge swampy area in southwestern Brazil. This is one of the richest places on earth in diverse fauna. There are no through roads via the Pantanal, so you can only enter it from two directions - from the north from Cuiaba or from the south through Bonito. Excursions for tourists are organized in the territories of fazendas (large farms). The programs are approximately the same, and include land and water safaris, and possibly a night one. A one-day trip from Bonito costs 238 reais ($45) plus another $20 round trip transfer, but a two-day trip is sharply more expensive - 810 reais for one or 1,110 for two. Moreover, they differ in content only in the night safari, on which, although there is a chance to see a jaguar, it is not very big.
<p/>

<p>
The transfer left very early, before 6 am, although there was no particular need for this - then at the fazenda we waited a long time for the start of each excursion. On the way, we passed through the city of Miranda, probably, you can also base yourself there if you drive your own car.

Next was fishing. I held a fishing rod in my hands for the first time in my life, and I didn’t catch anything, although the fish bit very often, but I couldn’t hook it.

It bites well because piranhas love meat.

<p>
Piranha is really toothy. But it turned out that their danger was exaggerated - they do not attack people, even if they accidentally bite, this is much less dangerous than an ordinary yard dog. Legends about the danger of piranhas appeared because once upon a time piranhas were specially caught for tourists and starved for several days, after which they really quickly tore apart a whole cow.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256141988_fedf39c71d_h.jpg"/>

The captured piranhas were fed to the birds so that they would fly closer.

The rarest and largest animal that can be seen on safari is the jaguar (the South American equivalent of the tiger). But jaguars are mostly nocturnal, so during the day the chances are very small (and at night, too, 5 percent). Here are jaguar tracks on clay.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255940976_56a19a002b_h.jpg"/>

<h2>Dourados</h2>

Dourados is a small provincial town in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul. I was passing through there on the way from Bonito to São Paulo. We can assume that I looked at a small, unremarkable city in the outback of Brazil.

Another masked monument. Judging by the signature, António João Ribeira died heroically in 1864, at the beginning of the Paraguayan War, when Paraguay attacked Brazil. Let me remind you that in the end, after 6 years, through the joint efforts of Brazil and Argentina, Paraguay was literally destroyed, losing most of its population and half of its territory. It was the state of Mato Grosso do Sul that expanded due to the war (but then there was one large state of Mato Grosso, the southern part was separated into a new state later).
