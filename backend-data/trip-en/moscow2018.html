<h1>Russia: Moscow</h1>
<i>9 August 2017 - 10 March 2019</i>
<h2>Moscow</h2>
<p>
In August 2017, I settled in <a href="../krasnogorsk">Krasnogorsk</a> near Moscow. Formally, I stopped being a tourist, but I still periodically made trips to Moscow in order to see all sorts of different areas where I had not been, and monuments. However, that fall I almost didn’t go anywhere; I only had photographs from just a couple of small hikes. Back in the summer, I immediately went to look at the new monument to Lenin, erected in the summer of 2017. This bust is by the author on the Alley of Russian Rulers
<p/>

<p>
The alley looks like this. On the left the row ends with Nicholas II, and on the right are the post-revolutionary rulers, including the heads of the Provisional Government Lvov and Kerensky.

Here is the only monument to Stalin in Moscow.

And the only monument to Gorbachev in Russia (not the only one in the world, there is at least another one in <a href="../berlin">Berlin</a>).

At first there were so many people who wanted to get there that classic ugly fences were erected around the entire nice modern park and entry was only allowed through the frames in a couple of places.

In 2010, a reconstruction of the palace of Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich was built on the southern edge of Kolomenskoye Park. The location was chosen so as not to destroy the established landscape of the historical part of Kolomenskoye and not to interfere with archaeological research.

I continue my search for monuments to Lenin, this time in the east and southeast of Moscow. This unusual monument - half bas-relief - stands in the Kuzminki metro area.

My path goes to Karacharovo - a rather isolated area of ​​​​Moscow, sandwiched between three railways. For a long time there was no metro there, not even close, and it was difficult to get out. Now there are two MCC and metro stations along the perimeter - the future big ring.

The closer the time to move from Krasnogorsk was, the more motivated I was to travel around the area while it was close. In the fall of 2018, I became noticeably more active and traveled to a bunch of different places in Moscow. Finally, I pulled myself together and visited the Lenin monuments closest to Krasnogorsk, near the top of the purple metro line. We start from Tushinskaya - here I had to overcome a giant junction, passing through a long stone tunnel.

The nearest metro station here is nominally Maryino, but buses go mainly to Pechatniki. In 2019, with the opening of the Kuryanovo MCD, it became even more accessible by transport, since one of the diameter stations is right there. Pechatniki metro lobby:

Monuments to Lenin began to run out, new ones were getting further and further from the center, with the exception of a small cluster in the northeast in the Baumanskaya-Elektrozavodskaya area. It wasn't entirely clear how accessible they were, but in the end I went and checked.

Because of this, there is a rather strict access system; you need to provide your passport numbers in advance so that they can issue you a pass, like in any sensitive enterprises.
