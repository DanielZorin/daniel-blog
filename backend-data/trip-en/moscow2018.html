<h1>Russia: Moscow</h1>
<i>9 August 2017 - 10 March 2019</i>
<h2>Moscow</h2>
<p>
In August 2017, I settled in <a href="../krasnogorsk">Krasnogorsk</a> near Moscow. Formally, I stopped being a tourist, but I still periodically made trips to Moscow in order to see all sorts of different areas where I had not been, and monuments. However, that fall I almost didn’t go anywhere; I only had photographs from just a couple of small hikes. Back in the summer, I immediately went to look at the new monument to Lenin, erected in the summer of 2017. This bust is by the author on the Alley of Russian Rulers
<p/>

<p>
The alley looks like this. On the left the row ends with Nicholas II, and on the right are the post-revolutionary rulers, including the heads of the Provisional Government Lvov and Kerensky.

Here is the only monument to Stalin in Moscow.

<p>
And the only monument to Gorbachev in Russia (not the only one in the world, there is at least another one in <a href="../berlin">Berlin</a>).

Zaryadye Park opened on the site where the Rossiya Hotel stood in the 90s, and then for 15 years there was a wasteland.

At first there were so many people who wanted to get there that classic ugly fences were erected around the entire nice modern park and entry was only allowed through the frames in a couple of places.

I never walked beyond the top of the ravine, apparently because there was nothing there before. Now there are bike paths here.

In 2010, a reconstruction of the palace of Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich was built on the southern edge of Kolomenskoye Park. The location was chosen so as not to destroy the established landscape of the historical part of Kolomenskoye and not to interfere with archaeological research.

I continue my search for monuments to Lenin, this time in the east and southeast of Moscow. This unusual monument - half bas-relief - stands in the Kuzminki metro area.

Now this estate is some kind of sanatorium, the entrance to the territory is closed, but Lenin can be seen from behind the gate.

My path goes to Karacharovo - a rather isolated area of ​​​​Moscow, sandwiched between three railways. For a long time there was no metro there, not even close, and it was difficult to get out. Now there are two MCC and metro stations along the perimeter - the future big ring.
<p/>

Most of the area consists of industrial enterprises; most likely, previously, mainly those who worked there lived here.

In 2017, before the New Year, a decoration appeared on Nikolskaya Street in the form of rows of garlands hanging over the entire width of the street. Everyone liked it so much that it became permanent.

It seems there is some kind of parking of Russian Railways trains here - there are too many of them for such an inactive station. Probably, trains rest here and then depart from the main hub on Komsomolskaya.

You need to go around the station on the left, and then go all the way, through the underground passage under the tracks. Oddly enough, this is not a closed area; there were no fences or barriers anywhere.

And finally, for a snack, a very simple and easily visible monument to Lenin - next to the Yaroslavl station. I had a photo of it much earlier, but it was of terrible quality, so I took a new one.

The closer the time to move from Krasnogorsk was, the more motivated I was to travel around the area while it was close. In the fall of 2018, I became noticeably more active and traveled to a bunch of different places in Moscow. Finally, I pulled myself together and visited the Lenin monuments closest to Krasnogorsk, near the top of the purple metro line. We start from Tushinskaya - here I had to overcome a giant junction, passing through a long stone tunnel.

This is how you can take a walk and look at the gateway. By the way, this gateway is located *above* the Volokolamsk highway, that is, the canal flows above the highway.

For the next two monuments you need to go to Lyublino. The southern and southeastern parts of Moscow were almost a complete terra incognita for me, especially the lower part of the light green and gray lines. In those parts, I only visited the museum of industrial culture and the Moscow shopping center with an Asian food market. I start from the Volzhskaya metro station, between two ponds.

This also explains why there are still not a single new high-rise building from PIK here - it is believed that there is bad air here (although I have not noticed anything like that).

The nearest metro station here is nominally Maryino, but buses go mainly to Pechatniki. In 2019, with the opening of the Kuryanovo MCD, it became even more accessible by transport, since one of the diameter stations is right there. Pechatniki metro lobby:

Monuments to Lenin began to run out, new ones were getting further and further from the center, with the exception of a small cluster in the northeast in the Baumanskaya-Elektrozavodskaya area. It wasn't entirely clear how accessible they were, but in the end I went and checked.
<p/>

Before this, I also visited Perovo on business, where I had already been in the winter with the goal of getting to Karacharovo, but another monument there remained in doubt. Along the way I found this building.

From a distance it looks normal, but up close you can see that it is a complete ruin with broken windows. It is unclear how it stands so abandoned.

Next to the Elektrozavodskaya metro station there is, in fact, the Elektrozavod - an absolutely stunningly beautiful building, similar to an oriental palace.

<p>
As I understand it, the Elektrozavod is still partially operational. Because of this, there is a rather strict access system; you need to provide your passport numbers in advance so that they can issue you a pass, like in any sensitive enterprises. At the same time, a lot of premises there are occupied by offices of third-party companies (I went inside to a photo studio), so if you want, it’s not difficult to get inside.

On a beautiful autumn day at the end of September, I went to see the new metro stations on the yellow line, of which seven were opened at once, and at the same time the Peredelkino district, previously very remote from the metro.
