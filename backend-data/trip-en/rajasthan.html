<h1>India: Ahmedabad, Jodhpur, Pushkar, Ajmer, Jaipur</h1>
<i>27 July - 6 August 2017</i>
<h2>Ahmedabad</h2>
<p>
Ahmedabad is the capital of the state of Gujarat and one of the largest cities in India, almost unknown outside its borders. There are so few tourists there that I spent two hours looking for accommodation in the center, and they didn’t let me in anywhere. However, the historic center of Ahmedabad was recently inscribed as a World Heritage Site, the first city in India to receive such an honor (the rest are individual palaces/temples). Let's figure it out.

<p>
At first glance, Ahmedabad is a very unattractive city.
<p/>

Yes, and at the second one too.

A long walk with a backpack in the rain and the general condition of the streets filled with puddles were not pleasant.

Among all this, an ancient gate rises.

Behind it is an area paved with surprisingly neat tiles, albeit damp and littered with debris.

If you look closely, you can see many old and once rich buildings around.

In Ahmedabad, a troublesome incident happened to me - I was supposed to leave by night train to Jodhpur, but when I arrived at the station, I received an SMS that my train was completely canceled. Some money was later returned to my card, but the question arose of what to do. Sitting on the floor of the station with a laptop, I quickly found out that there were no tickets for all of today's trains, even under the tourist quota. So I bought a ticket for the next day on the morning train, which I had to ride until the evening. I wanted to spend the night in the rest rooms at the station (in India, large train stations have them, just like in Russia), but there were no free places there. Then I found an inexpensive hotel for 500 rupees through Booking - it was not very far from the station, but not in the old city. The building looked something like this, not really matching the name Golden Plaza.

In the morning I managed to go to Lake Kankaria - an artificial lake from the 15th century, around which there is now a promenade and children's amusement parks.

In Ahmedabad, the people are especially friendly, they often ask to take their photo and smile, which is not very typical for other regions of India.

When leaving, on the train I grabbed a typical Indian lunch of rice, flatbread and stew.

The main feature of Ahmedabad is residential areas called "pol". A pol is a mini-district where some kind of community lives: a large family or people of the same caste or profession. It seems that this is an ordinary neighborhood with narrow streets, but in fact they all end in dead ends - the pol is isolated from neighboring areas, you can only enter through the main gate from the main street (or through the back doors). Many of Ahmedabad's pols retain rich wooden façades decorated with carvings.

<p>
It is clear that these places remember better times - now many wooden buildings are askew, the paint has peeled off the columns.

But more often than not, buildings have one floor, and the floor above is already owned by another person and with a different facade.

Ahmedabad is perhaps one of the most interesting cities in India to walk the streets, there is not only trash and backward technology, but also beauty.

<h2>Jodhpur</h2>
<p>
Finally, I had a gorgeous view from the window in my hotel! The hotel itself was also the cheapest of the entire trip to India - only 180 rupees ($3), this is what a tourist city means, when the supply of housing is greater than the demand.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256985094_0e0c8ddc96_o.jpg">
<p>
Jodhpur is not as famous as Jaipur because it takes longer to get there, but there are still more tourists here than in the 10 previous cities I visited combined. In the morning, looking out the window, I went to the fortress.

There are dozens of forts in the Rajasthan region, and many of them are well preserved, including palaces, not just walls. At the entrance to Mehrangarh Fort, you feel like a bug in front of the giant sheer wall of the palace.

There are such wells all over Rajasthan, they are needed because it rarely rains here, so it makes sense to store water in a large reservoir.

<h2>Pushkar</h2>
<p>
Pushkar is a very popular city among hippies and spiritual seekers. The concentration of tourists here is high, in addition, there are many pilgrims in Pushkar, because this city is also sacred, so much so that meat is generally prohibited in it: food is only vegetarian everywhere.

The main attraction is the lake, to which the ghats descend (like in Varanasi). The lake is quite small, you can walk around it in less than an hour, the city itself is not much larger.

You can also take a walk in the surrounding hills in Pushkar. I decided to climb the hill north of the bus station.

<h2>Jaipur</h2>
<p>
Jaipur, one of the most popular cities in India, was for me about the fiftieth (and last) city in this country. I spent three days in Jaipur but didn't walk around the city very much.

With the exception of one central area, most buildings in Jaipur are light yellow rather than pink.

The most famous palace in Jaipur is the Palace of the Winds. The windows in it are made so that the rooms inside are ventilated by air flows.

There is one metro line in Jaipur, but it does not reach the center a little, since it is not easy to build a tunnel under the historical district.
