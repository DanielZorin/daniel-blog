<h1>Malaysia: Kuala Lumpur, Langkawi, Tanah Rata</h1>
<i>9-14, 17-24, 28-31 May, 1-11 June 2019</i>
<h2>Kuala Lumpur</h2>
<p>
In May-June 2019, I lived in Kuala Lumpur for about a month, leaving for short trips to Brunei, Aceh and Tanah Rata. Kuala Lumpur has been one of my favorite cities since 2015, so it was ideal to base myself there. Unlike previous short stays, when I lived in a hotel, I decided to expand on the idea of ​​a long stay in June 2016 and rent an apartment, this time a whole one. It's not much more expensive than a hotel, but you can do some cooking. Looking at airbnb, it's easy to see a large cluster of accommodations just a stone's throw from the Petronas Towers. This is mainly in residential complex Mercu Summer Suites, in which there are many studio apartments for rent, as well as many small hostels and hotels.

My apartment.

<p>
The last few days after returning from Tanah Rata, I rented another apartment in the same building, it was about the same, only mirrored and the bed was separated by a wall.
<p/>

<p>
The building has two towers, each with its own set of elevators, access is by card only.

<p>
For entertainment, there is a rooftop pool in the middle between the two towers.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257356215_6b70ea3533_o.jpg">
<p>
There's billiards nearby. Billiards cost about a dollar an hour, so there was almost never anyone there (unlike the pool). The balls are yellow and red because this is English billiards, somewhat different from American and Russian.

<p>
Since the number 4 is considered unlucky, instead of the 4th and 14th floors there are 3A and 13A, and the apartments are numbered the same way.
<p/>

<p>
From the balcony I had a view of the building under construction opposite.

And before, the apartments here were probably more valuable, when this building did not exist.

A new metro line, the green one, has opened in Kuala Lumpur. It immediately opened along its entire length from northwest to southeast.

Also, two steps away from me was the Kuala Lumpur TV Tower, where I decided to go.

For almost a month I waited for the weather to be as cloudless as possible. As a result, I went to the observation tower literally on one of the last days, when it was no longer possible to wait.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257357140_b926f83670_o.jpg">

<p>
It turned out that it was impossible to climb straight up the nearby slope; I had to go in a spiral along the road.
<p/>

<p>
In the distance on a hill you can see a large palace - this is the palace of the King of Malaysia (Istana Negara). I’ve never been near it, because, as far as I know, the maximum you can do is stand by the fence.

And this is the block where my apartment was, it’s really hidden behind the nearby high-rise buildings.

Although I lived in the KLCC area, of course, I visited the Chinatown and Petaling street area many times - to eat, shop and just hang out.

At the southern end of Petaling Street there is now not only the pink metro line, but also the green one - underground.

In general, when traveling, the more time you spend somewhere, the less you manage to see per unit of time. Many days in Kuala Lumpur I just worked and walked to the store at most. But then my conscience kicked in, and I went to explore new areas of Kuala Lumpur. As a result, most of the trips around the city took place in the last few days. How to choose where to go? If you run out of instructions from the guidebook, you can take the metro and go to the final stop. In this case, it was doubly justified, because the new metro line had just opened. I took the Green Line and went to Kajang Station.

Like on the pink line, the trains here are automatic, so you can look ahead into the tunnel.

Almost the entire line (except for the section in the very center) is elevated, so you can see a lot along the way. Here is a large cemetery. It is clear from the numerous crosses that the cemetery is Christian.

<p>
The penultimate station is the stadium. From here I went back to Kuala Lumpur.

I had my sights set on going to see Templer Falls near Kuala Lumpur. Getting there is not so easy because there is no metro there - you need to take a bus going to the city of Rawang and get off at the highway.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255586477_db8db52266_o.jpg">

<p>
The place is not exactly remote - on one side of the highway there is a residential area, fenced with a wall. There is a bus stop pavilion here, but there is no overpass; I had to cross a multi-lane highway.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256317341_8ab0fbd872_o.jpg">

At the same time, on the other side it’s really a jungle, and there’s not much infrastructure.

Let's look at a supermarket in Malaysia. This is one of the Southeast Asian countries where supermarkets are plentiful and easy to find. There are also many supermarkets in Thailand, and in Singapore. In other countries of the region, supermarkets are just beginning to appear, and are not yet a mass format for shopping outside the capitals. This is a Giant supermarket - one of the main chains, and quite budget-friendly, I would say that it is an analogue of Auchan. Giant is usually found in any provincial town in Malaysia, but this one is in the heart of Kuala Lumpur in the Bukit Bintang area. Prices are in Malaysian ringgit, for simplicity 1 US dollar = 4 ringgit.
We start with vegetables, which are quite common here. Cucumbers - 5.59 ringgit per kilo.

Let's look at a more expensive supermarket in Malaysia, an analogue of Carrefour / Perekrestok or even something higher. This is the AEON store at Quill Mall in Kuala Lumpur. It's actually not much more expensive here than at Giant, but there is significantly more choice. This is immediately visible from the entrance and the section with vegetables: for example, there are mushrooms here, but there were none there. Very cheap, by the way - a dollar per kilogram (1 dollar = 4 ringgit).

<h2>Langkawi</h2>
<p>
Langkawi is an island in the northwest of Malaysia, north of <a href="http://goo.gl/hL7MwM">Penang</a>. Administratively, this is part of the state of Kedah, where <a href="http://goo.gl/s8jyzE">I had been before</a>, but it has a special status as a duty-free zone - alcohol is cheaper here. There are ferries to Langkawi, but it is easier to fly for 10-20 dollars by plane from Kuala Lumpur or Georgetown.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256337716_640416108d_o.jpg">

<p>
There is no public transport in Langkawi at all, you can only get around by taxi, fortunately, all the usual apps like Uber and Grab work. From the airport I immediately went to the western edge of the island to Oriental Village.

You can go down to the Sky Bridge on foot or by a small funicular. I thought that by walking I would avoid waiting in line, but there are cramped stairs and the traffic is also not very fast. In any case, the walk is 10-15 minutes.

Where can you go for a couple of days from Kuala Lumpur without a plane? Of the natural places, the Cameron Highlands are definitely in the top. I was there in <a href="http://goo.gl/R5Dtrc">2015</a>. Then I didn’t have time to see everything because of bad weather, so it was definitely worth visiting this magical place.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256188533_217ef4f905_o.jpg">

I settled again in Tanah Rata, in a house with half-timbered walls.

Now it was necessary to go down, preferably not head over heels. So I headed up along the hills where the path led.

On the second day, for simplicity, I bought a tour of the surrounding area, taking the version of the route that passed in the Brinchang area, and not Tanah Rata, which I already knew inside and out. The excursion costs 50 ringit ($12).

The first stop was the butterfly park. Butterflies are bred here for silk production, and at the same time you can look at other unusual insects.
