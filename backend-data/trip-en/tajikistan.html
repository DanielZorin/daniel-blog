<h1>Tajikistan: Khujand, Istaravshan, Ayni, Dushanbe</h1>
<i>11-14 May 2013</i>
<h2>Khujand</h2>
<p>
The driver with whom I was driving from Samarkand said that in Uzbekistan a lot of money is embezzled, so all new roads very quickly fall into deplorable condition. After crossing the border, not without <a href="../">adventures</a>, I found myself in a completely different country. The border guards and customs officers showed no interest in me. The route to Khujand requires a toll (about $1), the road condition is ideal. There are neat houses along the road, signs show the distances to different cities. I arrived in heaven.

Tajikistan was destroyed in the early 90s by civil war. Now the country is actively developing. Various international organizations work in Tajikistan, there are expats, the country is not among the top ten leaders in terms of the level of corruption (and Uzbekistan is in honorable first place in the world). Some will argue that Tajikistan is being bought up piece by piece by the Russians and Chinese, but in my opinion, this is better than being a proud independent country at war with the whole world. Support for national unity is expressed in the fact that the number of flags per square meter is off the charts. Tajiks do not waste time and place flags in rows at once.

I checked into the Leninobod hotel (the old name of Khujand).

Room. Modest and tasteful. I heard about interruptions in water supply, but nowhere in Tajikistan did I have problems with hot water.

Khujand mostly consists of private houses. It’s similar to Crimea, only the mulberries here are larger and juicier. It grows at every step, no one really collects it. I got lost in residential areas, walking from one mulberry tree to another.

There are no wooden houses. There is usually asphalt on the ground, but some alleys may not have it.

Tajikistan is led by the great dictator Emomali Rahmon. Definitely, he gets the title of the most loved president. Portraits of the great leader are everywhere.

<h2>Istaravshan</h2>
<p>
There are still monuments to Lenin in Tajikistan. Paradoxically, they even put national Tajik flags in rows around them, which probably makes Lenin turn on his spit in his hell. In Istaravshan they even painted the monument with gold paint.

<h2>Ayni</h2>
<p>
I was peacefully photographing the Fan Mountains in the village of Ayni, when the police suddenly crept up and asked for my documents. As luck would have it, my passport was taken from me at the hotel as a deposit for the key (I had previously seen this only in hotels at resorts in Egypt). I was taken to the department, which was right next door, apparently that’s why they noticed me. The local commander took my camera, while one of his plainclothes assistants interrogated me about who I was and how I came to Ayni. The policemen talked for a while, after which I was taken to a booth on the street, where one of them deleted some of the photographs. Apparently, he missed some due to inattention. Along the way, they continued to question me, sometimes asking questions a second and third time. I must say that in Tajikistan it is customary to shake hands even with strangers, so in the process I shook hands with almost all the Ayni policemen who passed by. One of the policemen drove with me to the hotel to copy down my passport data, for which I had to stop passing cars. I was embarrassed to ask why they didn’t use the official car parked there; apparently, gasoline for the needs of the police is provided in limited quantities. After checking, I tried to have dinner, but in Ayni, like in Europe, catering is not open on Sundays, so I had to settle for buying food at the supermarket. I had no great desire to walk further in the rain, so that was the end of the day.

<p>
A double room costs 40 somoni, that is, about $8. It was cheaper only in Cholpon-Ata, but that was an apartment, not a hotel, although in principle the comfort is about the same: shower and toilet are shared, except that there was no TV in Ayni. Even this cheap hotel had an excellent tea service.

In general, the word “kishlak” is roughly synonymous with the word “village”. Tajiks even say “this is a kishlak” with the same intonation as we say “not a city, but a big village.”

The road to Dushanbe is of excellent quality and can be covered in two to two and a half hours. The only bad section is the Anzob tunnel, where water flows through the walls and destroys the road; you have to drive slowly over terrible potholes in the semi-darkness. The views around are breathtaking.
