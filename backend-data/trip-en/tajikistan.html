<h1>Tajikistan: Khujand, Istaravshan, Ayni, Dushanbe</h1>
<i>11-14 May 2013</i>
<h2>Khujand</h2>
<p>
The driver with whom I was driving from Samarkand said that in Uzbekistan a lot of money is embezzled, so all new roads very quickly fall into deplorable condition. After crossing the border, not without <a href="../">adventures</a>, I found myself in a completely different country. The border guards and customs officers showed no interest in me. The route to Khujand requires a toll (about $1), the road condition is ideal. There are neat houses along the road, signs show the distances to different cities. I arrived in heaven.

Tajikistan was destroyed in the early 90s by civil war. Now the country is actively developing. Various international organizations work in Tajikistan, there are expats, the country is not among the top ten leaders in terms of the level of corruption (and Uzbekistan is in honorable first place in the world). Some will argue that Tajikistan is being bought up piece by piece by the Russians and Chinese, but in my opinion, this is better than being a proud independent country at war with the whole world. Support for national unity is expressed in the fact that the number of flags per square meter is off the charts. Tajiks do not waste time and place flags in rows at once.

<p>
I checked into the Leninobod hotel (the old name of Khujand).

There are floor attendants. The interior is nostalgic.

Room. Modest and tasteful. I heard about interruptions in water supply, but nowhere in Tajikistan did I have problems with hot water.

The old refrigerator has been here since Soviet times.

<p>
Khujand mostly consists of private houses. It’s similar to Crimea, only the mulberries here are larger and juicier. It grows at every step, no one really collects it. I got lost in residential areas, walking from one mulberry tree to another.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257311160_a8e702aa02_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are no wooden houses. There is usually asphalt on the ground, but some alleys may not have it.

And next to it is a landfill. At the same time, the streets are quite clean.

There are few larger houses.

<p>
On the central square, as usual, there are new shiny mosques.

On the other hand, there is the market.

What do Khujand and <a href="../kaluga">Kaluga</a> have in common? In both places, street signs say “street named X.”

Tajikistan is led by the great dictator Emomali Rahmon. Definitely, he gets the title of the most loved president. Portraits of the great leader are everywhere.

Let's take a look at the Khujand fortress. Inside is a museum of the history of Tajikistan, from ancient times to the present day.

Hall of Aryan civilization. Yes, Tajiks (as well as Iranians and Hindus) are the real Aryans.

<h2>Istaravshan</h2>
<p>
There are still monuments to Lenin in Tajikistan. Paradoxically, they even put national Tajik flags in rows around them, which probably makes Lenin turn on his spit in his hell. In Istaravshan they even painted the monument with gold paint.
<p/>

But he is no longer the main hero.
<p/>

<p>
The hero looks at us not from monuments, but from posters.
<p/>

<p>
But an increased concentration of Soviet-era monuments has been preserved here, almost like in Belarus. There is even an alley of busts of heroes of socialist labor.

Yes, without a dash.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257261505_43668ab8f9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It’s really worth saving the water, the river is almost dry.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256967489_b46c558274_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And once upon a time there was probably more.

There is no McDonald's in Istaravshan. But there is shawarma.

<h2>Ayni</h2>
<p>
I was peacefully photographing the Fan Mountains in the village of Ayni, when the police suddenly crept up and asked for my documents. As luck would have it, my passport was taken from me at the hotel as a deposit for the key (I had previously seen this only in hotels at resorts in Egypt). I was taken to the department, which was right next door, apparently that’s why they noticed me. The local commander took my camera, while one of his plainclothes assistants interrogated me about who I was and how I came to Ayni. The policemen talked for a while, after which I was taken to a booth on the street, where one of them deleted some of the photographs. Apparently, he missed some due to inattention. Along the way, they continued to question me, sometimes asking questions a second and third time. I must say that in Tajikistan it is customary to shake hands even with strangers, so in the process I shook hands with almost all the Ayni policemen who passed by. One of the policemen drove with me to the hotel to copy down my passport data, for which I had to stop passing cars. I was embarrassed to ask why they didn’t use the official car parked there; apparently, gasoline for the needs of the police is provided in limited quantities. After checking, I tried to have dinner, but in Ayni, like in Europe, catering is not open on Sundays, so I had to settle for buying food at the supermarket. I had no great desire to walk further in the rain, so that was the end of the day.

<p>
The hotel in Ayni does not seem to have a name.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255850981_5f74a42f6e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is the cheapest hotel I've ever been to.
<p/>

<p>
A double room costs 40 somoni, that is, about $8. It was cheaper only in Cholpon-Ata, but that was an apartment, not a hotel, although in principle the comfort is about the same: shower and toilet are shared, except that there was no TV in Ayni. Even this cheap hotel had an excellent tea service.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255120907_2fbbebbd07_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Ayni is a village in the Zerafshan Valley.

<p>
In general, the word “kishlak” is roughly synonymous with the word “village”. Tajiks even say “this is a kishlak” with the same intonation as we say “not a city, but a big village.”
<p/>

I bet Lenin used to stand here.

In my opinion, this Tajik village is better than many Russian ones.

Through the efforts of the Leader, there is also the Internet here.
<p/>

<p>
There is also a monument to the victims of the Great Patriotic War.

More precisely, there are two of them.
<p/>

<p>
The second one is kind of unsightly.

Like any village, Ayni has problems with garbage disposal. More precisely, there seems to be no problem - the garbage is simply thrown down the slope.

The road to Dushanbe is of excellent quality and can be covered in two to two and a half hours. The only bad section is the Anzob tunnel, where water flows through the walls and destroys the road; you have to drive slowly over terrible potholes in the semi-darkness. The views around are breathtaking.

Houses are quite nice. There are even villas with swimming pools. How many officials are there in Tajikistan?

<h2>Dushanbe</h2>
<p>
What I didn’t see at the very beginning in Almaty because of the rain, I got in Dushanbe, the final point of the journey.
<p/>

Dushanbe is not a very big, but very lively city.

An interesting feature of Dushanbe is that notice boards here are lined by type of notice, and everything is neatly pasted into its own column.
