<h1>Myanmar: Myawaddy, Mawlamyine, Bago, Yangon</h1>
<i>29 January - 2 February 2016</i>
<h2>Myawaddy</h2>
<p>
Thailand and Myanmar are on opposite sides of this river. You can cross the border here on foot.
<p/>

<p>
From the bridge you can clearly see the difference between these two countries. This is Thailand.
<p/>

<p>
And this is Myanmar. We will encounter this more than once.
<p/>

<p>
The border town of Myawaddy is quite lively, no less than the Thai-Cambodian border in Poipet. Myanmar border guards sit at the base of a large arch.

Along the road there are money changers sitting in a row with wads of money. I didn’t really like their exchange rate; for a dollar they gave a maximum of 1260 kyats, and some even 1200 (apparently they thought I was naive). At the nearest bank they gave me a sealed pack of 5,000 kyat bills and a little more, at an exchange rate very close to the market rate (about 1,290 at that time).

<p>
Five years ago, the town of Myawaddy was cut off from the world: the road from mainland Myanmar was closed to foreigners due to separatists in the region. You could only visit for one day from Thailand. Then the road was opened, but the “road” was a single-lane dirt road, along which traffic went only in one direction - the order changed every day. A year ago, a new good road was built along which you can get to Mawlamyine in four hours (instead of 12). Although, roosters still run under the wheels of jeeps driving along the new road.
<p/>

<p>
The road goes through picturesque passes.

<p>
Now any resident of Yangon can go shopping in Thailand in their own car. Most of the cars on the highway have Yangon license plates (the YGN region code seems to hint), significantly fewer have license plates of the current Kayin region or neighboring Mon.

Along the way you can see the first local features. Men in Myanmar wear skirts and preserve traditions.

<p>
But the villages do not look very traditional. Every house and especially a roadside canteen is hung with bright posters of mobile operators, just like in Cambodia. Myanmar is teleporting from the stone age to the internet age. 10 years ago, a SIM card cost more than $1,000, and communications were essentially limited to military personnel and diplomats. Two years ago it already cost 150 dollars, so especially wealthy tourists could already buy it. Now it costs 1 dollar, Internet tariffs are low, 3G is available everywhere in the central part of the country, and it is much better than local Wi-fi. Most often they hang posters of telenor and ooredoo operators that have appeared in recent years. The state MPT is lagging far behind.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256720373_b9e3b288bc_o.jpg">
<p>
There are also “I love Myanmar” posters. English is already fashionable here.
<p/>

<p>
Although we can say that it never really went out of fashion, because Myanmar was a colony of England. What remains from the British are the traditional clock towers in every city.
<p/>

The roadside eatery is reminiscent of similar ones in Cambodia.

The most popular dish in Myanmar is mohinga. It’s incredibly cheap, around $0.30
<p/>

<p>
Eventually, we arrive in the city of Mawlamyine, the capital of Mon State, the fourth largest city in Myanmar.

<h2>Mawlamyine</h2>
<p>
The first thing you see in Myanmar is trash. For some reason, all the blogs I read shyly avoided this issue. Myanmar is the dirtiest country I've ever been to (although I haven't been to India). The concept of throwing garbage in the trash bin has not yet found proper acceptance among the people of Myanmar, so most roadsides are littered with all sorts of garbage.
<p/>

For the Burmese, the river is a natural place to dump all kinds of waste.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255702367_1e242fd813_o.jpg">
<p>
There is a market next to this place, so in addition to plastic wrappers, spoiled fruits and vegetables are dumped here. Well, at least they decompose.

<p>
The space between the houses looks something like this. You need to walk around Myanmar carefully, otherwise instead of looking at the golden temples you could drown in a trash heap.
<p/>

<p>
Now let's raise our eyes a little higher. Cities in Myanmar look much the same as those in other countries in the region. Old houses are not particularly restored; everything is covered with advertising. If it were not for the Burmese letters, it would be difficult to guess in which country this photograph was taken.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256431786_20a929989b_o.jpg">
<p>
I wonder what everything looked like here 10 years ago? The same, only without the English inscriptions and Coca-Cola posters.
<p/>

But in some places, old antique signs have also been preserved, with text only in Burmese.

They still use tear-off calendars here. The last time I saw one like this was about 20 years ago at my grandmother’s place in a village.

Traffic lights are just appearing, people are getting used to them with posters like this.

<p>
People are also getting accustomed to elections gradually. In the late 1980s, when the communist regime in Myanmar went bankrupt along with the Soviet Union, the country already had elections, but soon after them the military junta seized power, declaring that Myanmar was not yet ready for democracy. In 2011, it became ready (or maybe the sanctions tormented it?). In general, the junta in Myanmar was no worse than dozens of undemocratic regimes in Asia and even more so in Africa: at least they were able to keep a multinational country from disintegrating and fought against drug production. However, for some reason the international community was so obsessed with Myanmar, so much so that even all the guidebooks described how to spend money so as not to support the junta with your 10 dollars.
<p/>

All over the city there are posters with portraits of some monks.
<p/>

<p>
Due to long sanctions in Myanmar, there is import substitution: the stalls have a lot of locally produced products. For example, I really liked the chips. Nowadays, many goods are also imported from Thailand and China.
<p/>

<p>
Just a few years ago (judging by the report of Artemy Lebedev), all car numbers were written in Burmese numbers and letters. Now they have been replaced with the Latin alphabet, so the Burmese can go to Thailand.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256431766_23dfb60efe_o.jpg">
<p>
But this does not yet apply to motorcycles; their numbers are old. A tourist cannot rent a motorcycle in Myanmar, and it is also impossible to bring it from Thailand, but it seems that you can buy a motorcycle inside Myanmar and ride.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257178814_b4aa1ceae8_o.jpg">
<p>
However, a motorcycle trip around Myanmar is only for unpretentious extreme sports enthusiasts - you will have to spend the night in a tent in the forest. There is a big problem with hotels in Myanmar: there are inexpensive hotels for tourists only in the most popular cities, in the rest, at best, there will be a very, very expensive hotel. Foreigners cannot stay in 90% of hotels. This is what a hotel looks like for locals.
<p/>

Often, all sorts of hipsters complain that globalization is supposedly killing local culture. I think this is nonsense. There was a tradition in Myanmar of placing jugs of water in public places for passers-by. Often the jugs still stand. Then they came up with water supply, and such water stations appeared.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257473150_50b43a79ee_o.jpg">
<p>
And now globalization is coming to Burmese monasteries - coolers with cold water have appeared in the halls. In my opinion, everyone has only gotten better, and the tradition remains as it was. By the way, to the left of the cooler is an old-style jug.

The tradition of carrying things on your head is not due to a good life. When everyone has motorcycles, they will carry people on motorcycles.

But will women in Myanmar stop smearing “thanaka” on their cheeks? Who knows. Now this is the most popular replacement for cosmetics here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255702202_903f834c11_o.jpg">
<p>
Most women smear this powder on their skin and also draw something on their cheeks for beauty, like football fans.

There is also such a tradition as riding on the roof of a minibus. Hurry - soon the Chinese will write off more buses, and this will no longer happen.

In Laos, in the city of Luang Prabang, crowds of tourists gather at dawn to watch people give food to Buddhist monks, so it turns into a show. In Myanmar (as well as in Laos in other cities too) you can see the same thing without any show.

Mawlamyine has been closed to tourism for a long time, and is not yet included in the standard routes. A beneficial consequence of this is the lack of a tourism industry in the city. Unlike Yangon, Mandalay and other popular cities, there is still no discrimination against foreigners here, expressed in the ripping off of tens of dollars at the entrance to temples (acting ones, not museums). The temples in different cities are not very different, so I was quite satisfied with visiting them in Mawlamyine.

There is one thing that is very annoying in Myanmar: you have to take off your shoes in the temples. No, I am aware that this is a Buddhist tradition. But, for example, in Thailand you need to take off your shoes <i>at the entrance to the temple itself</i> (which is also perfectly clean and carpeted), while in Myanmar - <i>at the outer gate of the territory</i>, and the territory of the monastery itself is, at best, clogged with dust and dirt, and at worst, it’s just a garbage dump (like everywhere else in the country). After Myanmar, it took some time to wash away the black color off my heels. In my opinion, the Burmese are hypocritical: garbage and dirt in the temple do not offend Buddha, but someone’s shoes do.

One of the relatively popular attractions among tourists in Myanmar is the temple with a golden stone hanging over a rock (Golden Rock) near the city of Kyaiktiyo. They have already made a paid entrance for foreigners, but the bigger problem is getting there - you still need to get to Kyaiktiyo, there are problems with hotels there, to put it mildly, and from there you still have to go with a transfer. It is much less known that there is a similar temple near Mawlamyine. There are three stones on top of each other.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257531744_59d47e5ab0_o.jpg">
<p>
To get there, you need to take a minibus from Mawlamyine to the north, get off at the desired village, and wait until there are about 20 people in the truck (you can wait a long time). The road up is quite extreme.

Finally, a few more examples of local architecture. Here is the clock tower. All English colonies have these in the city center, and in Thailand, apparently under the influence of the British, they also appeared. But in the French colonies (Vietnam, Cambodia) there are no such towers.

<h2>Bago</h2>
<p>
Tourists come to the city of Bago (or Pegu) to see the large golden pagoda. This is a very strange approach, because the true attractions of this city lie on a slightly different plane. Today I will show you all the interesting things in this truly impressive city.
<p/>

<p>
The route around the city was very simple. From the hotel in the city center, I walked along one of the main streets about three kilometers to this very pagoda, then along a parallel street back to the center to the train station, and a little around it. The pagoda was under restoration, there was no gold visible.

By the way, entry costs as much as 10 dollars (and another 30 cents for photography for some reason), so I didn’t go inside. I still saw the best view, so there was no point in looking at the scaffolding up close.

Nearby is a Burmese-style hotel for dear guests, who will be shown up the grand staircase and then quickly whisked away from the city so as not to spoil the impression.

By the way, about hotels. Hotels in Bago are not very good. The cheapest hotel with the romantic name "Hotel <a href="../san-francisco">San Francisco</a>" for $12 offers a room that in Thailand would cost $5 if you could find one so bad (at Khao San Road it is still possible, I guarantee). Thanks to it, I became more familiar with bedbugs, such a legendary phenomenon in our enlightened times. For almost a year and a half, I had never seen these cuties before.
Not far from the hotel there is an English church.

Here is the main architectural landmark of the city - the overpass. To force people to walk along it, a high fence was erected a hundred meters in both directions in the middle of the road. As you can see, it didn't help.

From the car they sell a fruit with the funny name jujube. In Thailand it is also occasionally found, but I didn’t like it, but in Myanmar it is simply excellent. It tastes like a very juicy apple without the sourness. Hint: you need to choose bright green jujubes, they are delicious. I can’t eat the yellowish ones at all - they taste disgustingly sweet, although the Burmese also eat them.

Somewhere here I went to have lunch at a local cafe. It was right next to the front entrance, so there was even a menu in English. As you can see, the prices are very low - there is basically nothing more expensive than 2000 kyat ($1.5).

At the station I wanted to buy tickets to Yangon the next day. It turned out that you can leave at 5, 5:30 and 6 in the morning, and then no earlier than noon. We decided to go at 6. Tickets can only be purchased before departure because the system in Myanmar is not computerized. About 15 years ago in Russia and China, it was also impossible or very problematic to buy a train ticket from an intermediate station in advance.
Tourists were served at the highest level - instead of the usual ticket office, we were taken inside to a room on the other side of the window and tickets were written out manually. It takes about two hours to get to Yangon, a ticket for a cheap class with ordinary wooden seats costs 600 kyat ($0.5), for a better class with soft seats - 1000 kyat. I took tickets for 600 in order to be closer to the people, but the conductor transferred us to a better carriage.

The railway in Myanmar is left over from the British, the trains are slow, the tracks are old, but it seems they have started to improve it. USB chargers have been installed in the carriages.

Even compared to what I saw earlier in Asia, Bago is impressive. Looking ahead, I’ll say that in subsequent cities it’s not so bad.
<p/>
<h2>Yangon</h2>
<p>
Of the major cities in Southeast Asia, Yangon is perhaps the most interesting from a tourist point of view. Of course, not because of the Shwedagon Pagoda, which is not much different from hundreds of other pagodas in Myanmar, but for two other reasons. Firstly, the colonial city built by the British has been preserved here - in fact, the only example of this scale in South East Asia. Secondly, due to the long isolation of Myanmar, Yangon is still a time machine, transporting you back several decades.
<p/>

Yangon has seen an increase in luxury hotels in recent years. In general, accomodation is not very good here, prices are much higher than in Thailand, and the quality is lower. Renting apartments generally costs insane amounts of money at European levels due to the imbalance of supply and demand.

The best part is the small streets that run strictly perpendicular to the river bank, crossing three wide parallel avenues. There are old residential buildings everywhere and an atmosphere reminiscent of some European cities, such as <a href="../milan">Genoa</a> or <a href="../porto">Porto</a>. It's hard to imagine a greater compliment for an Asian city!

A relic of the past: a ferry ticket costs 100 kyat (less than $0.1, written on the left), and for foreigners 2000 - 20 times more expensive.

Now Myanmar is in a transitional period: the technologies of the modern world already exist, but have not yet had time to displace many of the realities of the old world. On the streets of Yangon you can feel what life was like 50 years ago.

Newspapers are still popular in Myanmar. In the mornings you can see newspapermen (a profession long forgotten in our country) walking along the streets, giving newspapers to subscribers. From many balconies hangs a rope with a fastening to which a newspaper is attached. For others, the newsboy simply deftly throws a rolled-up newspaper onto the balcony.
