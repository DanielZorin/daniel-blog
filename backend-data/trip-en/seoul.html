<h2>Gwangju</h2>
<p>
Near the city of Gwangju there is a place included in the UNESCO list - the Hwasun Dolmens. There are a lot of dolmens in Korea, but Hwasun is the most convenient to get to, and at the same time you can visit Gwangju, the largest city in the southwest of the country.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256905109_b909f530c9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Dolmens are stone tombstones of ancient people (1st millennium BC). There are dolmens in both Europe and Russia (mainly in the Caucasus), but for unknown reasons, half of the world's dolmens are located in small Korea.
<p/>

<p>
By and large, these are huge boulders that stand on supports made of smaller stones.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256156696_d22db15bf0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Of course, this place will not blow your mind.

<p>
But it’s very pleasant to go here, because the dolmens are located in a very picturesque area.

<p>
The stones were mined here.

<p>
Getting here from Gwangju is not that easy. The public transport system is organized strangely: there are several bus routes that go to Hwasun, and then they go along different roads, but all the route numbers are the same, so it’s difficult to understand whether the bus you need has arrived or not. In several buses, the driver immediately said that he was going the wrong way, somewhere the third or fourth arrived, but he, too, only took us to the village of Neunju.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257199460_5bc37f672b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
From Neunju to the dolmens you need to walk another 5-6 kilometers to another village. At the same time, buses also go along this road; we caught a bus back only about a kilometer and a half from the dolmens, right at the turn.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255427222_c63e734a39_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are farms along the road.
<p/>

<p/>

<p>
Here is a typical Korean countryside.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256904759_a8eadeeaf3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
By the way, entrance to the dolmens is free, walk wherever you want. Next to the road there is a small camp, as if imitating the settlement of ancient people.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257199680_327e418fc1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Apparently, more people come here on weekends, but on weekdays there were almost no tourists.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257199710_5adb628d0d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The village near the dolmens is called Hyosan (indicated on the map as Hyosan-ri)
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256156991_f8b15729c2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Very cozy. Korean villages are no worse than <a href="../toulouse">French ones</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256157036_30437155e2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The town of Hwasun is not particularly remarkable. Except that the church has an unusual shape.
<p/>

<p>
In the entire town there is one huge apartment building, the rest are low-rise.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256157056_fe44ccf74d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The city of Gwangju... well, as usual.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257199370_abb970c771_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It's better to go for a walk in the evening.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257199340_c73d32c416_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Some kind of Masonic symbol glows on the building.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256949378_62ef47986a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It even looks like Russia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256356438_7a9aafc4f9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I even found a piece of bad asphalt in Korea!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256157276_670483a239_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And domes too!

<p>
Gwangju in Korea is famous as the city where the 1980 uprising against the military junta of Chun Doo-hwan was brutally suppressed, it was the Korean version of the Tiananmen massacre.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255427842_feb642d9c7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
For some reason, a car was driving around the monument, spraying acrid smoke.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257200300_fdacd554fa_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The central streets are very cheerful.

Please note: in Korea, all cars are either white, black or gray. In other colors, one in a thousand. Tradition, sir.
<p/>

<p>
Gwangju Bus Station is more like an airport.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255428017_4fad03578e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Depending on the direction you approach the gate, it will highlight where the departure is now and what time.

<h2>Daejeon</h2>
<p>
The city of Daejeon (million  of people, the fifth most populous in Korea) impressed me with its hotel. I planned to stay there for one night, but stayed for the second just to enjoy the divine hotel. Called Motel CF, located next to the bus station. It's a bit far from the center, but an e-mart supermarket is nearby.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256043516_b6a2e7c6b3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
What's so special about this hotel? The fact is that it is relatively inexpensive - 25,000 won ($23), but at the same time it has everything you can dream of. I have been to both 4 and 5 stars, but they were not all close to this modest Korean hotel. In five-star hotels there are a lot of completely useless services, for example, in the morning they will put a newspaper at your door in a local incomprehensible language. They will also offer internet for only $15 per day. But they definitely won’t think of hanging a huge TV on the wall. Moreover, this is not just a TV that shows news and shows in Korean or Korean porn. It's connected to a computer, so you can watch whatever you want on it.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256043531_656aa4c805_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At the same time, the room is very stylish.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256936213_b81294aa44_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The corridor is highlighted in green.

<p>
Here it is outside.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256792384_53c46549ef_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Most of the second day was spent watching Game of Thrones.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256792399_ac94f7af72_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Now about the city of Daejeon itself. The surroundings of the hotel were typical of Korea.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255313717_aef202d3da_h.jpg"/>
<p>
With an emphasis on entertainment: karaoke, clubs.

During the day, these signs look funny because they are designed to be illuminated at night.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257088035_6b70e0db84_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here it is.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257087940_862b770c71_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Let's go further. Daejeon is not a tourist city at all, but in Korea every city has a slogan and corporate identity. Here the slogan is simply "This is Daejeon."
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256244208_16e1289f55_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Daejeon is more of a university and industrial center. There was a cool motivational sculpture near one of the universities.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256043761_6a8f6ccff2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In one of the residential areas, houses are given English names.
<p/>

<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255313782_2ba0819903_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The area is cozy.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256244018_a759b39716_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Restaurants often display high-quality plastic models of dishes.

<p>
In Korea, it can easily be that there will be a river and meadows next to multi-storey residential areas, even very close to the city center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256043851_542bb5cb96_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The city center looks something like this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256792234_f8f9b4293c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Or so.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257087735_9ab159d943_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Where the main street intersects with the river, there is a huge park with a roller skating rink in the middle.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255314182_bcd6de6222_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On the other side of the river is the area where Expo 1993 took place. I still don’t understand what the point of this exhibition is, but the pavilions were quite good.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256043976_4cee9f8b39_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Now this place looks more like a children's playground.

<p>
On the main street of Daejeon there was a memorial, in honor of what exactly, I did not understand, because the explanation was only in Korean (but most likely something related to the Japanese occupation or World War II). The nameplates clearly show how common the surname Kim is in Korea - almost two plaques went to it alone.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255314137_5c1c0f92d0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On the second day I wanted to go to the dam, located outside the city; the place seemed picturesque. But public transport failed - the required bus never arrived, although its number was on the list at the stop; moreover, the electronic board counted down the minutes until arrival, but the bus itself never appeared. All this time we waited at a stop on the outskirts of Daejeon, where we needed to change buses. There was an ultra-high-rise building nearby.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257778340_454884443b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
After waiting for almost two hours, we went to have dinner at a nearby restaurant. We got a whole pan of fried octopus for $12.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256244523_d3d71747f0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Not cheap, it would seem, but in addition they also brought noodles with vegetables.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255314472_13b4d91cc9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On the same outskirts, a real Korean commieblock was discovered, which, apparently, had not yet been demolished.

<p/>

<p>
Daejeon is not particularly interesting in itself, but it is an incredibly convenient city for living: reasonable in size, with developed infrastructure (there is even a metro), and reasonable prices. Plus, it is located exactly in the middle of Korea, so it is convenient and quick to get to anywhere in the country from there.
<p/>
<h2>Wonju</h2>
<p>
A small town where I changed from one bus to another.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255741336_928aff37ca_h.jpg"/>
<p>
However, it does have a motto in English: “Healthy Wonju.”
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255741421_7c9aabf6dc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A good city to do business.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256785585_dee703bc0b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are shopping centers, including Lotte.

This city would not be remembered for anything if I had not finally noticed this restaurant.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255943963_34eb49be96_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Its presence in Korea, especially in a small provincial town, was unexpected: I thought such things only existed in Japan. This restaurant serves fugu fish.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255012237_b1e726bfcf_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The product is even displayed in an aquarium at the entrance, so there is no doubt. Fugu is a fish with poisonous insides, even a small piece is deadly. It is prepared by specially trained chefs who know how to clean the meat (non-poisonous) to make it safe for consumption.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255741801_17dd3e99c4_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Sokcho</h2>
<p>
Seoraksan is the most popular national park in mainland Korea. To get there, you first need to get to the city of Sokcho and check into a hotel there (by the way, the cheapest of all where I stayed in Korea - 20,000 won or $18). You can get to the park by city bus, where for the first time I was unable to pay with the t-money pass, which works in all major cities, and even in Jeju and Gyeongju. Entrance to the park costs about $3, and another $10 for the cable car ride.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256282809_d7fce3c7b7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
If you don’t have the time or energy for a long hike, then the smartest strategy is to first take the cable car to the top, walk around everything there, and use the rest of the time on the tracks below.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256578585_9c6693062d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are two routes from the cable car station. One leads up here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256578490_b8761c8b1c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You can climb to the very top. An absolute minority decide to do this, because the climb there is not entirely trivial, at some point you need to use a rope (visible in the photo below), but overall it’s not difficult.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255533431_3b389b2e68_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At the top there is a Korean flag and a stall selling medals for conquering Seoraksan.

<p/>

<p>
The road down takes about twenty minutes along the stairs. There are a couple of temples there.

In the evening we tasted the legendary Korean dish - barbecue made from fatty pork. Costs 6,500 won per person. The meat is fried in small pieces on a portable stove. Then the piece needs to be dipped in oil and black sauce (left). Place the meat and a clove of garlic in a lettuce leaf, add herbs and kimchi cabbage to taste.

<h2>Samcheok</h2>
<p>
One day, a young girl fell off a cliff and drowned in the sea. Soon the fish disappeared in the sea, and the locals realized that her restless evil spirit was to blame. But one day a fisherman urinated in the sea, and a fish appeared. People figured out what the poor dead virgin was missing, and that’s how Haesintang Park appeared.

Koreans are generally famous for their lack of taboos on topics that would be considered obscene in Europe. Many tourists visit the defecation-themed park near Seoul. Somewhat less known is the erotic sculpture park on Jeju Island. There are almost no stories about the penis park, because it is located quite far from the main cities.
<p/>

How to get there? First you need to come to the city of Samcheok, there are direct buses from Seoul, if from other regions, then with a transfer through Gangneung - the local transport hub. From Samcheok it takes about 40 minutes by local bus. The schedule can be obtained from the tourist center near the bus station.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255432026_996f55b8c0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are hotels in Samcheok, including those in traditional Korean style.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256178624_b78ad0dc88_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The motto is "Wonderful Samcheok".

<h2>Suwon</h2>
<p>
Suwon is a suburb of Seoul with a population of a million, interesting primarily for its fortress walls. If in neighboring China the walls are always built in the shape of a square, then Suwon has a European layout - the walls are built in a circle.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256618360_b885c21d3b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The walls stand on hills, possibly artificial.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255778638_b9a18554f5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also a giant Gothic cathedral here in Suwon.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256322604_602b0f84e0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The cathedral simply dominates this city, which has no special skyscrapers.

<h2>Seoul</h2>
<p>
Korea usually begins with Seoul, but my trip ended there instead. Seoul is a truly enormous city, it seems that it never ends. There are as many as five World Heritage sites within the reach of the Seoul metro: I think, this is a record (on par with <a href="../tianjin">Beijing</a>). The first place is the Changdeokgung Royal Palace.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256231824_1a37015155_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It is more convenient to go there on Tuesday, when tourists are allowed in at any time. On other days it's only with excursions, which go often, but, unfortunately, almost everything is in Korean.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257870250_d392dfcd5e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
All palaces are quite similar.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256231904_096308d789_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256528040_2a819a1260_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are so many buildings that it’s easy to find a corner where no one will interfere with your photo shoot.
<p/>

<p>
But there is one trick in this palace.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255483996_edb10c0c0b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Cherry trees grow in backyards.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256528120_771e71db50_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a lot of it, and no one needs it. At the same time, the cherries are quite juicy and tasty. There were also apricots growing in one of the courtyards, but they were not very ripe yet.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256231989_de21bdea2e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Another more popular palace is Gyeongbokgung.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256232514_b114262e2b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At the entrance you can take pictures with the guards. The last Korean king was overthrown by the Japanese more than 100 years ago.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256232479_4fc58b63b7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It's quite similar from the inside.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256528685_dd29b61ad3_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256528620_b1f617d6d4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The throne rooms and chambers are quite modest by European standards.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255688783_509bf345ee_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are plenty of secluded corners here too.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255688843_9bd018d10c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And the backyards are larger.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255688873_b4af7de29c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Next to the first palace is Jongmyo Temple, the place where kings performed rituals to commemorate their ancestors. The spirit of each king after his death was enclosed in a special tablet, which was kept in a special room. It is interesting that a special path was equipped for the spirits, which led directly to the temple, while everyone else entered from the side. This is still observed now - you cannot step on the path.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256524580_ba30b338df_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Entrance here is also only with a guided tour, but here I was lucky to arrive just in time for the start of the tour in English.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256228279_87ae5013be_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Royal burials have the same special path.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256527820_2c24be7026_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are quite a few of these burials, they are scattered across different parts of Seoul. They look more like Viking burial mounds than Chinese imperial burial grounds.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256527780_49623cea0c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Another interesting place, however, not popular among tourists is Namhansanseong. This is a fortress on the hills in the corner of Seoul. Mostly Korean weekend hikers come here. You need to get there first by metro, then by bus.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254749842_f4629ecbf2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a good view of Seoul from the walls.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256524395_b977b91005_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There would be, if not for the haze.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255684388_347ea77065_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This fortress is so huge that it was originally designed as a place where in case of problems the entire population of the capital could be evacuated.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256524415_d2c91183af_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Now there are several villages here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255684268_76dbaa5067_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And vegetable gardens. Yes, in the capital of Korea.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256228094_5b0d6135f9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Apart from these attractions, most of Seoul was built in the second half of the 20th century. There is only one small block on the hill, made to look like an antique.

Like Busan, Seoul has a Russian district. More precisely, Russian-Mongolian.
<p/>

In the Seoul metro, like in China, it is normal to travel 20-30 stops. The metro covers a huge area, including neighboring cities. You can take the subway about 50 kilometers from the center of Seoul.

The screen shows stations and a cute puppy. By the way, I never tried dog soup - I couldn’t find a single establishment that served it.

At all stations there are boxes with gas masks, in case of an attack by North Korea. It’s close to the border here, I even signed up for an excursion, but it was canceled due to the MERS virus epidemic.

But overall, shopping in Seoul is pretty solid.

Most of Seoul looks like this. Slightly higher than other cities.

This, by the way, is the Gangnam place. You can press a button and dance.

<p>
There is also a very nice park, laid along the bed of a small river through the entire city center. Looks like <a href="../texas">San Antonio</a>.

One day, because of the rain, I went to the Museum of Korean Life (next to Gyeongbokgung Palace). Museum in Chinese style - with models and sculptural compositions. Here's a wedding ceremony, for example.
<p/>

The well-known Itaewon district did not impress me; apparently, you need to go there at night and drink in a bar.
<p/>

<p>
On the main street of this area the word “Hello” is written in all sorts of different languages, and there's a small educational program on geography.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255485051_083171cc21_h.jpg"/>

Seoul is unique in that the large river next to which the city stands is not its center or any important element. It flows somewhere in the south, and the embankment is overgrown.
<p/>

An ordinary residential area in Seoul looks like a residential area somewhere in Germany. There are no Chinese blocks here.

I heard that e-sports (that is, computer game competitions) are very popular in Korea, to the point that there are special arenas for tournaments. While in Seoul, I found out where the main Starcraft arena, called the e-Sports stadium, is located. It's right here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255689393_57c85ef0fe_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And... drum roll... here it is - the arena!
<p/>

<p>
To find it, I had to run around this shopping center quite a bit. The arena is on the 9th floor, while the elevator only goes to 7, then you need to take the escalator to 8, and then find another escalator to the attic.
<p/>

An entire large store is dedicated exclusively to figures of robots from the Gundam anime series; fortunately, since 1979, the series and, accordingly, different robots have accumulated quite a lot.

The older generation plays in real life. The most popular game is Go (here it is called baduk). Korean chess, whose rules are most similar to Chinese ones, is also held in high esteem.
<p/>

The cafe offers noodles "doshirak" (this word in Russia is the synonym of cheapest instant noodles).

In terms of food, Seoul is no worse than other Korean cities. I found a barbecue place for 7,000 won per person, and they also have a lot of snacks including salted squid.
<p/>
