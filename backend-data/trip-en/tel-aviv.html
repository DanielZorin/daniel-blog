<h1>Israel: Nazareth, Haifa, Acre, Rosh Hanikra, Tel Aviv</h1>
<i>14-18 January 2014</i>
<h2>Nazareth</h2>
<p>
Yeshua Ha-Nozri was born in Bethlehem and lived in Nazareth, like his parents. Now Nazareth is the only city in Israel where the majority of the population is Arabs, and it even has a day off on Friday, not Saturday. During the day, Nazareth is an Arab flea market, just like the Christian quarter of Jerusalem.

<p>
At night the city is empty.

<p>
There are signs to the only local hostel, which is very convenient, otherwise it would be very difficult to find.
<p/>

<p>
The city is also covered with Arab election posters.

<p>
The main attraction of Nazareth is the Cathedral of the Annunciation, where an angel informed Mary of the conception of Jesus.

<h2>Haifa</h2>
<p>
To the south of the city center of Haifa there were areas populated by local Arabs. When Israeli independence was declared in 1948 and war began, the Arabs packed up and moved away from Israel. As in any self-respecting country at war, in Israel history is covered with a thick layer of propaganda, so that it is now difficult to establish to what extent the Arabs were "helped" to leave. Perhaps not at all. For example, if I found myself in a war surrounded by enemies, I would first of all move away from the fighting, regardless of the loss of housing. In any case, Israel won more than one war, and the truth is on the winning side, no matter what the losers say about universal injustice. The result of this is that there is now a real ghost town with destroyed houses right next to the center of Haifa.

<p>
Like any abandoned place in the center of a big city, the Wadi Salib quarter is first and foremost a garbage dump.
<p/>

<p>
The broken windows theory is at work: the windows here are broken in the most literal sense, so throwing trash here is a nice thing to do.

<p>
It can be seen that this used to be an Arab city, similar in layout to Jerusalem or Nazareth, with narrow passages and multi-tiered streets.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256360058_9038d20f96_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Now it is already overgrown with grass.

<p>
Modern residential buildings and offices are being built around abandoned houses where possible.

<p>
Most houses are fenced with barbed wire. There are a lot of drug addicts and homeless people hanging out here anyway.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255431302_1388f96a9e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is some kind of tent right under the fence.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255431367_9ea541972c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I managed to get into one of the abandoned houses.

<p>
It's such a sad sight inside. What is lying below looks like stones, but in fact it is some kind of soft material, similar to foam rubber. I can assume that it was used to finish the ceiling.
<p/>

Another room. Judging by the tiles on the wall, it was a bathroom.

<p>
Why aren't these houses demolished? It's completely unclear. There is an opinion that this is being done to create a semblance of legality, so that the owners still hold the private property rights, although in practice their chances of getting through the border are zero. But this is a strange explanation; Israel has enough military power and influence to influence the opinion of Arab countries, especially on such an issue of little relevance now as the homes of people who fled 70 years ago.

<p>
Now let's move on to the rest of Haifa, fortunately it is a very nice and sincere city, not affected by religious obscurantism. By the way, Haifa has one of the largest communities of Russian-speaking Jews, maybe that’s the reason?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256360363_e1ca4f9e43_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The main attraction of Haifa and a UNESCO monument are the Bahai Gardens. Before arriving in Haifa, I had never heard of such a religion as the Baha'is, but it turns out they have 5 million followers. To be completely frank, I think the difference between a religion and a sect is very subtle and subjective. If the Bab and Bahá'u'lláh had appeared yesterday, the Baha'i faith would have been called a sect in any way, especially by all sorts of Orthodox and Islamized media. And since it appeared back in the 19th century, it is already a full-fledged religion. They even lobbied for the inclusion of their temple in the UNESCO list.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256909129_931ff0a5a7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Most of the gardens are closed to visitors, which makes Baha'is similar to Muslims (in general, the Baha'i religion really took a lot from Islam), who also like to limit access to their shrines.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255430762_c4c8280ae2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You can go to the main temple. The Báb, the first prophet of this religion, is buried there. Inside there is one room, where a bunch of artifacts are placed on the altar, and a couple of quotes from the Baha'i holy book. A couple of people were sitting on the rug and reading something.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257204195_7414f5e6d5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Directly below the Bahai Gardens is an area called the German Colony. The houses here are similar to German ones only very vaguely.
<p/>

On the slopes of the mountain there is a sculpture park, the creator of which was probably inspired by the <a href="../norway">Vigeland</a> park.

<h2>Acre</h2>
<p>
Acre ("Akko" in Hebrew) is the last stronghold of the Crusaders in Israel and a UNESCO heritage site, but after visiting several cities in Israel and more than 9,000 in Europe, it is not particularly impressive .

<h2>Rosh Hanikra</h2>
<p>
Rosh Hanikra is a village on the border between Israel and Lebanon. The border has long been tightly closed, since Israel and Lebanon are at war.

Before the independence of Israel, when these lands were colonies of England and France, for some time there was even a railway from Istanbul to Cairo itself. The railway tunnel still remains in Rosh Hanikra.

<h2>Tel Aviv</h2>
<p>
Tel Aviv is a large modern city where people come to hang out and relax. Unlike Jerusalem, there are no problems here to eat or go somewhere on a Friday evening, there are no bearded men in black hats, and the beach stretches along the entire city.

The new city of Tel Aviv is not particularly interesting, however, it is included in the UNESCO list (as is Villa Tugendhat in <a href="../brno">Brno</a> ), which confirms the fact that this list cannot be blindly trusted.

The site of the death of Yitzhak Rabin, the Prime Minister of Israel, who signed the Oslo agreement, which provided for the creation of a Palestinian state, and caused the indignation of radical Zionists. And also one of the many Holocaust memorials.

Then they came up to me and asked, “If you had a vagina and it could talk, what would it say?” I couldn't find what to answer.

I liked Israel (and Palestine) in everything, except for the terrible high prices. On departure at the airport I prepared for a hellish search and interrogation, but there was nothing terrible. They asked me what I was doing in Morocco, Indonesia, UAE and Jordan. I didn’t check in my luggage, so they didn’t rummage through my things. To avoid digging through your belongings, you need to remember to put all electronic devices, including charging cords, in your carry-on luggage. At the hand luggage control, they scanned my shoes for a long time, because there was dried mud from <a href="../jordan">Petra</a> on them, but nothing more.
