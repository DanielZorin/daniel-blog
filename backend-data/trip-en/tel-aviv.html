<h1>Israel: Nazareth, Haifa, Acre, Rosh Hanikra, Tel Aviv</h1>
<i>14-18 January 2014</i>
<h2>Nazareth</h2>
<p>
Yeshua Ha-Nozri was born in Bethlehem and lived in Nazareth, like his parents. Now Nazareth is the only city in Israel where the majority of the population is Arabs, and it even has a day off on Friday, not Saturday. During the day, Nazareth is an Arab flea market, just like the Christian quarter of Jerusalem.

At night the city is empty.

There are signs to the only local hostel, which is very convenient, otherwise it would be very difficult to find.

The city is also covered with Arab election posters.

The main attraction of Nazareth is the Cathedral of the Annunciation, where an angel informed Mary of the conception of Jesus.

<h2>Haifa</h2>
<p>
To the south of the city center of Haifa there were areas populated by local Arabs. When Israeli independence was declared in 1948 and war began, the Arabs packed up and moved away from Israel. As in any self-respecting country at war, in Israel history is covered with a thick layer of propaganda, so that it is now difficult to establish to what extent the Arabs were "helped" to leave. Perhaps not at all. For example, if I found myself in a war surrounded by enemies, I would first of all move away from the fighting, regardless of the loss of housing. In any case, Israel won more than one war, and the truth is on the winning side, no matter what the losers say about universal injustice. The result of this is that there is now a real ghost town with destroyed houses right next to the center of Haifa.

Like any abandoned place in the center of a big city, the Wadi Salib quarter is first and foremost a garbage dump.

The broken windows theory is at work: the windows here are broken in the most literal sense, so throwing trash here is a nice thing to do.

<p>
It can be seen that this used to be an Arab city, similar in layout to Jerusalem or Nazareth, with narrow passages and multi-tiered streets.
<p/>

Most houses are fenced with barbed wire. There are a lot of drug addicts and homeless people hanging out here anyway.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255431302_143624a1e7_o.jpg">

There is some kind of tent right under the fence.

<p>
It's such a sad sight inside. What is lying below looks like stones, but in fact it is some kind of soft material, similar to foam rubber. I can assume that it was used to finish the ceiling.

Why aren't these houses demolished? It's completely unclear. There is an opinion that this is being done to create a semblance of legality, so that the owners still hold the private property rights, although in practice their chances of getting through the border are zero. But this is a strange explanation; Israel has enough military power and influence to influence the opinion of Arab countries, especially on such an issue of little relevance now as the homes of people who fled 70 years ago.

<h2>Acre</h2>
<p>
Acre ("Akko" in Hebrew) is the last stronghold of the Crusaders in Israel and a UNESCO heritage site, but after visiting several cities in Israel and more than 9,000 in Europe, it is not particularly impressive .
<p/>

<h2>Rosh Hanikra</h2>
<p>
Rosh Hanikra is a village on the border between Israel and Lebanon. The border has long been tightly closed, since Israel and Lebanon are at war.

Before the independence of Israel, when these lands were colonies of England and France, for some time there was even a railway from Istanbul to Cairo itself. The railway tunnel still remains in Rosh Hanikra.

<h2>Tel Aviv</h2>
<p>
Tel Aviv is a large modern city where people come to hang out and relax. Unlike Jerusalem, there are no problems here to eat or go somewhere on a Friday evening, there are no bearded men in black hats, and the beach stretches along the entire city.

The new city of Tel Aviv is not particularly interesting, however, it is included in the UNESCO list (as is Villa Tugendhat in <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/239503.html">Brno</a> ), which confirms the fact that this list cannot be blindly trusted.

I liked Israel (and Palestine) in everything, except for the terrible high prices. On departure at the airport I prepared for a hellish search and interrogation, but there was nothing terrible. They asked me what I was doing in Morocco, Indonesia, UAE and Jordan. I didn’t check in my luggage, so they didn’t rummage through my things. To avoid digging through your belongings, you need to remember to put all electronic devices, including charging cords, in your carry-on luggage. At the hand luggage control, they scanned my shoes for a long time, because there was dried mud from <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/310031.html">Petra</a> on them, but nothing more.
