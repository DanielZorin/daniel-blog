<h1>Morocco: Casablanca, Marrakech</h1>
<i>23-25 September 2012</i>
<h2>Casablanca</h2>
<p>
Everyone associates Casablanca with some kind of film, but since I don’t know anything about cinema, I didn’t know anything about this city except where it is located.
<p/>

<p>
At first glance, it seems that the city is very pretentious. Wide boulevards with tall palm trees and white houses around, what could be cooler? Replace all-inclusive houses with hotels, and you will get the Sharm el-Sheikh embankment.
<p/>

<p>
The harsh reality is in the details. For example, the road surface on the boulevard is far from European quality.

Behind the next tree all illusions disappear. Welcome to Africa.

Facades are decorated in two ways. Electricity meter...

There is a clothing market in the city center. Out of boredom, one merchant first offered me leather goods and then hashish. Some kid followed me for several blocks and begged until one of the local residents scolded him. You can also eat an excellent chicken dish at the market for $2, with free delicious bread. You can probably buy something in stores, but I hate haggling, so I’d prefer to buy in Spain at a fixed price.
<p/>

<p>
There are big problems with transport in the city.
<p/>

<p>
Road signs are bent.

<p>
Trams are just getting ready to open. There is only one line, while there is no traffic on it, in the evenings people come to the stops and hang out.
<p/>

<p>
And here is the tram itself. Parked in a square with government buildings.

We forgot only the most important thing - to write where we are going.

Central station.

<p>
Guys, this is the main station in a city with a population of 4 million, almost like St. Petersburg! Even in Kungur the station looks more impressive.
<p/>

<p>
On the streets it seems that there is no one working. Everyone is sitting in a cafe or just on a chair in the shade.
<p/>

<p>
During the day, city residents go out to the promenade to the beach to watch people and show themselves off. The "beach" is located directly below the main mosque.
<p/>

<p>
Everyone sits on the rocks with their clothes on, relaxing.
<p/>

<p>
Although if you walk 10-15 minutes along the embankment, you can find a small piece of sandy beach. There were just a few drunks hanging out there (Allah will forgive everything) and a group of schoolchildren competing in accuracy, trying to hit an empty wine bottle with a stone.
<p/>

Those who do not reach the beach sit on the parapet.
<p/>

<p>
Many even wear European clothes.

In Morocco, people in white coats are not doctors, but schoolchildren.

Place Mohammed the Fifth is the only place thanks to which Casablanca can, with a stretch, be called a city of contrasts.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255266432_a86d950f53_o.jpg">
<p>
If not for it, Casablanca could only be called a big slum.

<p>
After all, the most important landscape in the city cannot be hidden behind government buildings. Just look down at the pedestrian crossing.
<p/>

Or behind the wall on the corner.

Thank you for not forcing me to look at this under my feet.

<h2>Marrakech</h2>
<p>
The most unpleasant thing in Morocco is the imperial habits of the local government. They manifest themselves in many ways: territorial claims to neighbors, boulevards with palm trees lined with fences enclosing garbage dumps, European prices with non-European quality (this applies to hotels, shops, and transport), portraits of the king at every step. Or here’s an example: you pass some village, and in it there is a triumphal arch, like in Paris.
<p/>

<p>
Most villages in the desert look unpresentable and blend into the surrounding landscape.
<p/>

<p>
In Marrakech the city authorities managed to restore beauty and create conditions for tourists. The station here looks like a train station, not a stop.
<p/>

But you still see neon red stars.

<p>
Although there has never been communism in Morocco, the red flags that are everywhere in Marrakesh evoke clear associations.
<p/>

In Marrakech, houses are painted red.

<p>
They paint it and build it from ordinary concrete blocks.
<p/>

<p>
The main square is impressive in size.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256625063_8f1e5a21b3_o.jpg">
<p>
As expected, there is a market in the passages behind the square.
<p/>

<p>
Unlike Casablanca, they sell a lot of souvenirs here.

<p>
Behind the gate you can see the local solution to the garbage problem: since there are no ditches, dump it behind the wall in the yard.

I didn't notice any particular pressure from locals. Once they offered to go to a store, and on one of the central streets they invited people to restaurants, but this was nothing out of the ordinary. There are many oriental beauties.
<p/>

I didn't understand anything once.

<p>
I didn't understand anything twice.

There is an incredible number of pay phones in Morocco. It is unclear why they did not become extinct with the advent of mobile phones. I doubt that the machines are aimed primarily at tourists. Maybe there are some favorable conditions there compared to mobile operators?

<p>
Taxis are divided into two types. White Mercedes - "big taxis" - are expensive, can go to another city, and usually several people rent them, chipping in. Local taxis are cheap, metered, and painted red in Casablanca and light brown in Marrakech.
<p/>

Well, the main attraction of Marrakech is the alleys. Unlike other cities in Morocco, the alleys are very narrow and completely empty, without shops or stalls.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256425911_0c07925187_o.jpg">
<p>
Just bare walls and doors, sometimes just a sign.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257468370_b3da882965_o.jpg">
<p>
And sometimes just going down to the basement.
