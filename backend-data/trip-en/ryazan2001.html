<h1>Russia: Ryazan</h1>
<i>June 2001</i>
<p>
I went to Ryazan for a children's chess tournament. This was the first trip outside the Moscow region. I was not impressed with Ryazan, the food there was especially bad - I still remember how terrible the food was in the canteen. Perhaps because of this, for a long time I had a prejudice against traveling around Russia, until I visited Suzdal in 2011.
