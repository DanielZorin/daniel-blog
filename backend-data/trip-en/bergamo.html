<h1>Italy: Bergamo</h1>
<i>30 November - 1 December 2016</i>
<h2>Bergamo</h2>
<p>
The cheapest way to get from Cologne to St. Petersburg was to fly Ryanair Cologne-Milan-Tallinn. A ticket from Cologne to Milan cost only 8 euros, I think this is the cheapest of all my air flights (not counting <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/318180.html">free flight to St. Petersburg</a>). I spent the night in a hostel in Milan near the train station because it was cheaper, but I spent the free half a day exploring the city of Bergamo, where the budget airport is located.

<p>
Incredible but true: the name of the city of Bergamo is pronounced with the emphasis on the first syllable.

There is a lower town near the station and an older upper town on the hill.

The shortest way up from the center is this narrow path.

<p>
There is also a longer road on the other side, along which buses run.

Someone made a vegetable garden near the walls of the old city.

<p>
There are already good views from here, but there are even better ones - on the hill west of the old city. It’s also easy to get there on foot, or take the funicular.

But the city center is poorly visible from here - trees and roofs somewhat obscure the view.

This is where Bergamo ends and the village of Orio al Serio with the airport begins.

If there were stinginess championship in the world, Italy could claim prizes. Weighing bags for 2 euros! I wonder if at least one person in history has used this machine?
