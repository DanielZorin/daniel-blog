<h2>Singapore</h2>
<p>
Singapore is famous for its prohibitions, but besides them there are many interesting signs and public service announcements.
Here are the most well-known rules of conduct on the subway. For smoking, the fine is $1000 (Singaporean, that's about 700 American), but for some reason the penalty for bringing in durians is not specified. By the way, <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/295687.html">Hong Kong</a> has the same rules and comparable fines, but no one talks about it.

Rules of conduct in the botanical garden. In general, nothing special: do not smoke, do not touch animals and plants, do not litter.

It says right on the emergency call button that the fine for pressing it is $5,000.

Singapore is literally the birthplace of Captain Obvious. Nowhere else have I seen so many clear explanations of obvious things. Here, for example, are the rules of behavior in the elevator. In Russia there are also rules of conduct in elevators/on escalators/in subway cars, but they are written in small print somewhere in the corner, but here it’s really interesting to look at them.

It's obvious: a branch can fall from a tree, so be careful in the park.

It seems that in Singapore there is danger waiting for you literally on every corner. If a branch falls on your head, your phone will be stolen.

Or they’ll grope you in the subway. In fact, the likelihood of such troubles in Singapore is much lower than in 99.9% of cities in the world.

Don't be fooled - Singapore is not a concentration camp, it's no tougher here than in any other normal city. It's basically forbidden to act like a pig.

Singapore's downtown is very reminiscent of city centers in the <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/381043.html">USA</a>. Unlike Asian cities with skyscrapers, here the business district is separated from residential areas and shopping areas, only offices, only hardcore.

It's not uncommon to see some of the coolest vertical gardening in Singapore.

Surprisingly, Singapore is not a very pedestrian-friendly city. There are a lot of giant junctions with a bunch of traffic lights across each lane. It is not uncommon to find intersections where there is only a pedestrian crossing on three of the four sides, meaning you may need to make three crossings just to cross the road. It is not recommended to jaywalk here, and not only because there is also a fine for this, but simply because in Singapore the traffic is busy and consists almost exclusively of cars, and not of mopeds, as in neighboring countries.
<p/>

<p>
This is despite the fact that car usage here is discouraged as much as possible. For the first time I see that in addition to paid parking, there is also a toll for travel on some streets: these structures above the road read the license plates and automatically deduct 50 cents from all those passing by.

A little away from the business center in Singapore, many old colonial quarters have been preserved. They are kept here in exemplary condition: everything is restored, painted, and a design code is applied that prohibits huge flashy signs.

Not far from the hostel there was a public swimming pool, where entry even for tourists cost around a dollar (and for citizens of Singapore it was even half the price). For comparison, in St. Petersburg I have not found a pool cheaper than 250 rubles ($4) for a 30-40 minute session, but here you can swim all day.

In Singapore, housing is expensive; I paid $12 per bed in a hostel. A month in the Indian quarter costs at least $200 - also not budget friendly; in Malaysia and Thailand you can rent an entire apartment for this money.

Chinese and Indian food is widely available in Singapore, as is the case in Malaysia. It's cheaper than a "European" restaurant, especially if you find a food court where office workers go. For example.

<p>
Chinese. Prices are 4-6 Singapore dollars per dish, that is 3-4 USD. In Malaysia, of course, it is three times cheaper - the same price in ringgits. But for a highly developed country it is cheap. Remember Europe, where such a lunch will cost closer to ten euros. Taking into account European-level salaries, the standard of living in Singapore is very high.

This burger costs 1 Singapore dollar, they are sold two per person. Don't take chicken legs, they are microscopic. And a Coke Float is average for a dollar and a half.

Unlike Hong Kong, where vast hilly areas are given over to natural parks, Singapore is small and fairly flat, so almost all of it is built up. But there are still a few pieces of nature. The first one is the botanical garden included in the UNESCO list.
