<h1>Spain: Badajoz, Merida</h1>
<i>30 September 2014</i>
<h2>Badajoz</h2>
<p>
The region of Extremadura was taken over by some kind of junta.

Probably fascist? Here, they put their mark on the bridge. <i>It is a pun on the fact that Russian propaganda called the Ukrainian government "fascist junta from Kyiv"</i>
<p/>

All jokes aside, Extremadura is probably the least visited province (more precisely, autonomous community) in Spain. It is not en route neither in the north of Spain nor in the south. You can only get here if you travel from Madrid to Lisbon, but few people travel this way.
Badajoz is the largest city in the region. It is actually located on the border with Portugal; minibuses go to the Portuguese Elvas three or four times a day. There has been no railway service for a long time.

<p>
Badajoz was never part of Portugal (although it was periodically stormed during the wars), however, there is a clear Portuguese influence here. First of all, tiles.

<p>
Secondly, the inscriptions are in Portuguese.

<p>
Thirdly, a sign “Do not post advertisements.” It is also specified here that the person whose advertisement is on the leaflet will be fined. Apparently, naive Spaniards don’t think of spamming advertisements advertising their competitors.

Fourthly, tiles.

But other than that it's Spain. Residential areas, like in <a href="../bilbao">Zaragoza</a>.

This building is copied from a similar one in Seville.

<p>
The free-standing gates with thick towers so beloved by the Spaniards, like in <a href="../valencia">Valencia</a>.

<p>
In general, in Badajoz there were many levels of walls, most of them have not survived, only a few pieces remain.
<p/>

<p>
The oldest citadel stands; the bushes in it are trimmed evenly.

<p>
In the fortress you can walk along the walls completely free of charge.

From here you can clearly see the only “skyscraper” in Badajoz.

Badajoz signs are unique, like those in other cities in Spain.

<p>
Suddenly! In Badajoz, just like in the Russian province, cures for drug addiction are advertised on the walls. Is life really that hopeless here? Badajoz residents need to go to <a href="../vladimir">Kokhma</a> for treatment.

<h2>Merida</h2>
<p>
Merida is the first capital of Portugal. It was Merida (Emerita Augusta) that was the capital of the Roman province of Lusitania, which later became Portugal.
<p/>

<p>
Merida is one of the richest cities in Spain for Roman ruins.
<p/>

<p>
There are already two aqueducts here.

But apart from the Roman ruins, there is not much to see in Merida.

Except that the main square is nice.
