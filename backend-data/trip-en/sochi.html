<h1>Russia: Sochi</h1>

<h2>Sochi</h2>
<p>
Lenin among the palm trees is the symbol of the warmest city in Russia.

A year ago the Olympic Games were held in Sochi. Before them, Sochi was not very interesting: as a beach resort, it was more expensive than Crimea and Abkhazia, and with a pebble beach, when there is sand in Anapa. The city consisted of several dozen sanatoriums, where people vacationed with free vouchers, and a chaotic private sector. In preparation for the Games, an attempt was made to turn Sochi into a well-equipped city. Let's see what happened.

Housing is being actively built in Sochi. The panorama of the city looks quite nice.

This is Adler, the place where the airport and the Olympic Park are located.

I think this is a move in the right direction. It is logical for more people to live in a region where the climate is favorable. It is strange to hear officials talk about the need for a rapid settlement of Siberia and the Far East, when people are leaving there due to lack of work. In Soviet times, in these places with a harsh climate, to put it mildly, they built factories and settled people for only one reason: if an evil enemy attacks, he will reach Siberia last, and it will be possible to hold out there. In Canada, no one complains that at the latitude of Omsk, a million-strong city, the largest city has a population of about 10 thousand; no one seeks to massively populate the Yukon.

Now the main thing is that there is work there, and at the moment the situation in the country is rather bad.

The modern architecture of Sochi, compared to the standard gray boxes, makes a pleasant impression. For the Olympics, the few existing commieblocks were painted like in Slovakia. New buildings are being built with Europe in mind.

It looks funny in places.

No, palaces in Europe don’t look quite like that.

But in Krasnaya Polyana, where the outdoor competition took place, it turned out quite well.

It’s just that here the entire town was built from scratch, so there is no such contrast (previously there was a small village, from which only the name of the railway station remains: Esto-Sadok, this is because immigrants from Estonia lived there since the 19th century).

Reminds me a little of <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/262788.html">Yoshkar-Ola</a>, of course.

By the way, a ride on a ski lift to the mountains is quite expensive - 800 rubles. Elbrus is half the price. Although taking into account the dollar exchange rate it is not that expensive. In general, there are a lot of people at the ski resort; thanks to cheap flights, going here is very profitable compared to the Alps.

I didn’t go because the weather was poor, it was raining, and there was also fog in the mountains.

A new good airport was built in Sochi. A railway station was built near the airport, to which the Aeroexpress was allowed from Adler. Taking into account the exorbitant price, the short distance (the airport is actually within the city) and the huge number of buses that run from the airport, including directly to Sochi and Krasnaya Polyana, there is no point in this at the moment, and the service was eventually cancelled. If Sochi had a full-fledged suburban train system, much like the S-bahn in German cities, it would be possible to include the airport in some routes, but so far there is no such system.

When you take off, you can see the old airport building, which was obviously a nightmare on the level of <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/355560.html">Volgograd</a>.

A new station was also built in Adler.

Now in Russia there are two stations that can at least be compared with the stations in an average Chinese city (the second is in <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/356925.html">Samara</a>). The layout, with the building on top and the platforms down the escalator, is very similar to the Chinese one.

Things are worse in the Olympic Park. There are not enough sporting events and concerts to load it
<p/>

The main stadium is used as a warehouse for some metal structures.

Tours around the park are mainly for the curious.

The Formula 1 race also took place here.

In Sochi, a map of public transport routes was posted at all stops. Without exaggeration, I can say that the bus system in Sochi is currently the friendliest in Russia.
<p/>

<p>
Both new buses, similar to those in Western Europe, and old ones travel to Sochi.

Now a little about the bad things. Russia has never learned how to lay smooth asphalt and make drainage. Do you see the storm drain in this photo? I don’t see either, but I only see a puddle.

The Russian passion for building up everything with fences, like in concentration camps, is manifested in all its glory in Sochi.
<p/>

<p>
Yes, fences were needed in the Olympic Park when there were crowds of people there to organize them and avoid stampedes. But now they are not needed, and there are three-meter fences, like on the state border or in a prison.
<p/>

Some building was fenced off with barbed wire.

For the Olympics, they tried to make Sochi accessible to foreigners by translating the inscriptions into English. There are traditionally problems with English in Russia. For the most important elements, for example, for bus schedules, normal translators were found, but for the rest they hired first-year students. The result is this "MGIMO finished" translation, similar to equally funny attempts at translations into English in China.

<p>
Such blunders also happen. No, it's avenue, not "prospect".

But translating “Shashlyk” as Grill is witty, I approve.

Well, Sochi is not designed for Americans.

Although there are T-shirts with English inscriptions.

The beach in Sochi is narrow and rocky. In the summer there must be a hell of a crowd here.

<p>
Like other Black Sea resorts, breakwaters are installed here to prevent the sea from eroding the beach.

Well, like in any respectable Russian city, many sculptures were placed on the streets in Sochi.

And who is this? Horse in a coat. <i>In Russian it's a rhymed joke reply.</i>

<p>
Let me sum it up. Sochi cannot yet be called a world-class resort, but at least a start has been made; one of the most decent cities in Russia has been built here. Yes, huge amounts of money were invested in Sochi, but at least this money did not serve the purpose of destruction, senseless propaganda or the construction of private palaces, as usual in Russia, but something was done with it that will stand even after Putin. It costs a lot.
