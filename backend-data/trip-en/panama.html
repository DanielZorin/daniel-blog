<h1>Panama: David, Panama City, Colon, Portobelo</h1>
<i>6-10 November 2021</i>
<h2>David</h2>
<p>
Panama is the richest Central American country with a history separate from the rest. While the previous five countries originally made up the United Provinces of Central America, Panama was part of Colombia (and for a time, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador were one big country). This is surprising considering that there is still no road from Panama to Colombia (“Darién Gap”). At the end of the 19th century, the Americans decided to build a canal in Panama and supported the fight for independence from Colombia. Since then, Panama has been inextricably linked with the canal, the territory of which was for a long time part of the United States, and was completely transferred to Panama only at the end of the 20th century. Panama grew around the canal, and was not particularly colonized elsewhere, so there are almost no large cities in this country, except for the capital. David is the third largest city (about 200 thousand inhabitants), and the first city on the road from Costa Rica. I stayed there overnight to break up a very long drive.

Border of Panama and Costa Rica. There is a big market around. I approached the border guard, he sent me to photocopy documents into Panamanian territory. After I already received the stamps, I still had Costa Rican money left, so I went back to Costa Rica to exchange them for dollars, which are used in Panama.

<h2>Panama City</h2>
<p>
Panama City, the capital of Panama, is the richest and most developed major city in Central America. Thanks to the canal and offshore companies, there is a lot of money in Panama, people come here to live and do business. Such a Latin American version of <a href="../uae">Dubai</a>. If other capitals of the region are at best <a href="../costa-rica">ordinary</a>, and at worst <a href="../el-salvador">extremely dangerous</a>, the capital of Panama has a lot to see and is quite safe. I rented a hotel room in a new area, not far from skyscrapers - it’s a little more expensive than the most budget hostels in the historical center, but the location is more prosperous.

I slowly walked to the area with skyscrapers. It was Sunday, so all the streets were empty and the shops were closed. In other Central American countries, I would not walk the streets on Sunday.

On the other side you can see the Bridge of the Americas, connecting the two banks of the Panama Canal. The canal is believed to be the border between North and South America, so I was in South America at that moment, and most of the trip was in North America.

There are many large supermarkets in Panama, they seem to cater to the rich because they sell mostly imports from the US. A pack of grapes costs $7; in general, all fruits are terribly expensive. At the same time, you can buy fruits cheaply at the market or just on the streets.

Of course, while in Panama, I went to see the Panama Canal. Not far from the capital, near the Miraflores locks, there is an observation deck. The ticket price in 2021 has been halved - from $20 to $10. On the official website it was written about strict protocols that they allow groups in strictly according to time, but in fact this is all profanation - you come, buy a ticket, join the nearest group. No one makes sure that you spend no more than half an hour at the observation point, and this is impossible, because the groups do not differ from each other in any way (they should have handed out colored helmets, like in Costa Rica).
<p/>

<p>
The Panama Canal passes most of the way through a large lake on an isthmus; a series of locks have been completed to connect the lake with both oceans, and for this it is necessary to raise and lower the ship 26 meters to the level of the lake.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51736358179_867aca0744_o.jpg">
<p>
There is a railway running parallel to the canal.

Observation deck. I arrived a little early, the first ships were just approaching the locks, and then they came one after another. At first there were few people at the observation deck.

You can also go through the canal on a small yacht; it costs $500-2000 depending on the length. Small ships enter the lock together with the large ones.

The ship entered the lock. In the distance you can see another ship passing through a parallel lock. Some time ago the canal was expanded, new locks with a larger width were built, as a result a new standard for the width of ships appeared.

<h2>Colon</h2>
<p>
Colon, the second largest city in Panama, stands at the northern entrance to the Panama Canal. The guidebooks say that this is a dangerous city, but I thought it would be like in San Jose, that is, dangerous compared to Japan, but overall normal. What is there to be afraid of after Honduras and El Salvador? Once in Colon, I was simply disgusted by what a dump it was - truly the worst city of the entire trip.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51734911542_dce2fc32cd_o.jpg">

<p>
The weather, of course, added to the infernal appearance of the city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51736624635_52739b69f8_o.jpg">
<p>
Even on the main street, some of the buildings are abandoned. One block away, almost all the buildings are like this, there are continuous squats and slums. It was scary to even go there, I saw them from the taxi window when I was driving back.

<h2>Portobelo</h2>

The fort in Portobelo is included in the World Heritage List, so I decided to go there (with a transfer through Colon) and at the same time see provincial Panama.

The fortresses were built in the 17th century. In principle, they are not very different from similar fortresses along the entire coast of Brazil or on the Caribbean islands.
