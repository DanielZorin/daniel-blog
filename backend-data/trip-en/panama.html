<h1>Panama: David, Panama City, Colon, Portobelo</h1>
<i>6-10 November 2021</i>
<h2>David</h2>
<p>
Panama is the richest Central American country with a history separate from the rest. While the previous five countries originally made up the United Provinces of Central America, Panama was part of Colombia (and for a time, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador were one big country). This is surprising considering that there is still no road from Panama to Colombia (“Darién Gap”). At the end of the 19th century, the Americans decided to build a canal in Panama and supported the fight for independence from Colombia. Since then, Panama has been inextricably linked with the canal, the territory of which was for a long time part of the United States, and was completely transferred to Panama only at the end of the 20th century. Panama grew around the canal, and was not particularly colonized elsewhere, so there are almost no large cities in this country, except for the capital. David is the third largest city (about 200 thousand inhabitants), and the first city on the road from Costa Rica. I stayed there overnight to break up a very long drive.

Border of Panama and Costa Rica. There is a big market around. I approached the border guard, he sent me to photocopy documents into Panamanian territory. After I already received the stamps, I still had Costa Rican money left, so I went back to Costa Rica to exchange them for dollars, which are used in Panama.

The highway in Panama is good and wide.

In villages they even make overpasses.

<p>
Around the bus station everything is somewhat dirty, but overall the city is clean. A LOT of bright yellow taxis everywhere.

And then it's an American city without sidewalks with one-story houses.

<h2>Panama City</h2>
<p>
Panama City, the capital of Panama, is the richest and most developed major city in Central America. Thanks to the canal and offshore companies, there is a lot of money in Panama, people come here to live and do business. Such a Latin American version of <a href="../uae">Dubai</a>. If other capitals of the region are at best <a href="../costa-rica">ordinary</a>, and at worst <a href="../el-salvador">extremely dangerous</a>, the capital of Panama has a lot to see and is quite safe. I rented a hotel room in a new area, not far from skyscrapers - it’s a little more expensive than the most budget hostels in the historical center, but the location is more prosperous.
<p/>

<p>
My neighborhood looked something like this, a mixture of high-rise and small buildings.
<p/>

<p>
On the wider street there are supermarkets, like in America.

<p/>

<p>
I slowly walked to the area with skyscrapers. It was Sunday, so all the streets were empty and the shops were closed. In other Central American countries, I would not walk the streets on Sunday.

I was in Panama for 4 days, and two of them were “Sundays” - next Wednesday was a public holiday.

It’s good that at least the coronavirus test could be taken on a holiday.

Apart from Sundays, it looks like a lot of establishments, especially restaurants, are closed forever (apparently due to restrictions).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51736602775_7da19d90de_h.jpg"/>
<p>
For example, this is what a pedestrian street with restaurants looks like now.

After some time, I reached the ocean shore, along which there is a park, separated from the rest of the city by a wide highway.

By the time I got there, it started to rain and fog rolled in.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51735947488_a156e51163_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But gradually the outlines of the city began to emerge from the fog.

On the other side you can see the Bridge of the Americas, connecting the two banks of the Panama Canal. The canal is believed to be the border between North and South America, so I was in South America at that moment, and most of the trip was in North America.

There are many large supermarkets in Panama, they seem to cater to the rich because they sell mostly imports from the US. A pack of grapes costs $7; in general, all fruits are terribly expensive. At the same time, you can buy fruits cheaply at the market or just on the streets.
<p/>

In a supermarket you can be fined 7% of the purchase price if you do not pick up the receipt at the checkout.

Panama has an old colonial city listed as a World Heritage Site. For a long time this was one of the dangerous criminal areas, now it has been cleared out, but the surrounding areas are still poorer than the new center.

The historic center is unusual in how empty it is. There are almost no businesses here, only rare souvenir shops and a few cafes, literally about 5-10 in the entire old city (all very expensive).

Of course, while in Panama, I went to see the Panama Canal. Not far from the capital, near the Miraflores locks, there is an observation deck. The ticket price in 2021 has been halved - from $20 to $10. On the official website it was written about strict protocols that they allow groups in strictly according to time, but in fact this is all profanation - you come, buy a ticket, join the nearest group. No one makes sure that you spend no more than half an hour at the observation point, and this is impossible, because the groups do not differ from each other in any way (they should have handed out colored helmets, like in Costa Rica).
<p/>

<p>
The Panama Canal passes most of the way through a large lake on an isthmus; a series of locks have been completed to connect the lake with both oceans, and for this it is necessary to raise and lower the ship 26 meters to the level of the lake.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51736358179_7a769f63fb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a railway running parallel to the canal.

Observation deck. I arrived a little early, the first ships were just approaching the locks, and then they came one after another. At first there were few people at the observation deck.

<p>
You can also go through the canal on a small yacht; it costs $500-2000 depending on the length. Small ships enter the lock together with the large ones.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51736600665_57f50fa5b2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A big ship is approaching.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51734887542_c30ae616c6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The ship entered the lock. In the distance you can see another ship passing through a parallel lock. Some time ago the canal was expanded, new locks with a larger width were built, as a result a new standard for the width of ships appeared.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51736600580_6bf9520029_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The gates close and the water begins to descend along with the ship.
<p/>

<p>
And the ship enters the next lock. On both sides, two cars on rails hold the ship so that it keeps its course.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51735946638_ab0c4831a0_h.jpg"/>

<h2>Colon</h2>
<p>
Colon, the second largest city in Panama, stands at the northern entrance to the Panama Canal. The guidebooks say that this is a dangerous city, but I thought it would be like in San Jose, that is, dangerous compared to Japan, but overall normal. What is there to be afraid of after Honduras and El Salvador? Once in Colon, I was simply disgusted by what a dump it was - truly the worst city of the entire trip.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51734911542_d3d4b30970_h.jpg"/>

<p>
The weather, of course, added to the infernal appearance of the city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51736624635_9bf129e250_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Even on the main street, some of the buildings are abandoned. One block away, almost all the buildings are like this, there are continuous squats and slums. It was scary to even go there, I saw them from the taxi window when I was driving back.
<p/>

It’s also very dirty here, like on the border of El Salvador and Honduras.

<h2>Portobelo</h2>
<p>
The fort in Portobelo is included in the World Heritage List, so I decided to go there (with a transfer through Colon) and at the same time see provincial Panama.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51736357244_71d2258232_h.jpg"/>

<p>
The fortresses were built in the 17th century. In principle, they are not very different from similar fortresses along the entire coast of Brazil or on the Caribbean islands.
