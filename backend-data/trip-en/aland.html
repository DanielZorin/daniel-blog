<h1>Åland Islands</h1>
<i>9 October 2016</i>
<p>
The Åland Islands are a self-governing territory of Finland where Swedish language is spoken. These islands are considered a separate country by many criteria: they have their own parliament, almost separate citizenship (an ordinary Finnish citizen cannot buy land there and vote in local elections), the official language is only Swedish, but not Finnish, and separate customs legislation, according to which Åland is not part of the European Union, so all ferries across the Baltic stop there for at least 15 minutes so that Duty Free trading can be done on board.

The Åland Islands passed to Russia along with Finland in 1809, and after the Crimean War they were recognized as a demilitarized zone by a special international treaty. Until 1917, it was the westernmost territory of Russia. The westernmost point is very unusual - far from the main group there is an uninhabited island called Märket with an area of ​​only 0.03 square kilometers, which is divided (!) between Finland and Sweden. There is a lighthouse on the island built by the Finns, so the border was changed from straight to curved so that the lighthouse is on the Finnish part, although it is closer to Sweden.

<p>
The easiest way to get to the Åland Islands is by ferries going from Helsinki and Turku to Stockholm; a ticket from Turku to Åland cost only 10 euros (inexpensive for a five-hour journey).

The Åland Islands look like huge stones lying in the sea.

Many islands are just rocks with a dozen trees growing on them.

<p>
Mariehamn is the only city on the islands. There is public transport that goes to other settlements, but it runs quite rarely, which is not surprising. Therefore, I was only able to visit the capital. With a car you can check out some places of interest like the ruins of a couple of Russian fortresses from the 19th century.

So, the Åland Islands, autonomous and demilitarized! Flag with the same cross as Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland and Norway. And the Faroe Islands. The Åland flag is almost Icelandic, but yellowish.

<p>
There are football clubs here. Some of them play in the Finnish championship, some in the Swedish (not in the top divisions). IFK Mariehamn is the only top team; in 2016 they won the Finnish Premier League and took part in the selection for the Champions League. There is even a national team of the Åland Islands that played many official matches against teams of similar countries such as <a href="../gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, Greenland, the Falklands and even Sealand.
