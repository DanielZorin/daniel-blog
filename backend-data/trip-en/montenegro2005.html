<h1>Montenegro: Ulcinj, Bar, Budva, Kotor, Perast, Cetinje, Podgorica</h1>
<i>18 June - 2 July 2005</i>
<p>
In the summer of 2005 I went to Montenegro. This was the third and last trip for winning a school Olympiad. Unlike previous trips, here most of the time was spent on the beach, near the city of Ulcinj in the south of Montenegro, near the border with Albania. I was lucky to have accompanying people who were also interested in traveling around the country, so in addition to general excursions to Budva and Kotor   Perast, I managed to go to Cetinje, Podgorica, Bar, and Lake Shkoder/Skatar on the border with Albania. We didn't manage to get to Dubrovnik though, so <a href="../croatia">Croatia</a> was added to my list of countries much later.

For some reason I have very few photographs left, probably because the film was running out. Not a single photo from Kotor, but there are several from Bar with its huge fortress.
