<h1>China: Xiamen, Nanchang, Jingdezhen, Huangshan, Nanjing</h1>
<i>1-12 May 2015</i>
<h2>Xiamen</h2>
<p>
I have already talked about Chinese cities that were partially built by Europeans: <a href="../dongbei">Dalian</a>, <a href="../tianjin">Tianjin</a>, <a href="../guangdong">Guangzhou</a>, <a href="../hong-kong">Hong Kong</a>, <a href="../macau">Macau</a>. Xiamen is also one of them. The city opened up after the First Opium War, mainly to the British. In terms of layout, this is perhaps the most European of all Chinese cities: here the historical and business centers are separated (unlike Tianjin).

<p>
Xiamen is very popular among Chinese tourists, but not so much among foreign tourists. It’s interesting that here on the streets there is navigation for tourists: signs, maps of the area, just like in Europe, but it’s not translated into English.
<p/>

Does anyone think that all Chinese cities are the same?

Typically, Chinese cities have a rectangular grid of streets (as in America), while the central (in ancient times, walled) part should be square, this is according to Feng Shui. Xiamen's layout is more reminiscent of Moscow. The relief is favorable - Xiamen is located on a round island, so the main streets run in arcs.

Now let's walk through the small alleys.

I came across a computer club. In China, these are still quite common.
<p/>

Mostly in clubs, schoolchildren play games. It’s unclear why not at home; computers seem to be inexpensive now. And the room looks just like the tangles in our basements in the old days.

A strange building was discovered in one of the courtyards. At first glance, this is a European-style mansion.

But it seems that something went wrong and they decided to build a wooden room right into the balcony.

Xiamen is a coastal city, so they sell lobster here. They are not cheap - 200 yuan.

<p>
There is even a beach on the island near the center.
<p/>

The water is a little cold and the view is not as nice as in Sanya; ships sail along the strait.

The access to universities in China is only for students, same as in Russia. It would be interesting to see a Chinese university, but entry to the territory is only with passes.

I had to be content with the view from above; to do this I had to walk to a large monastery outside the university grounds.

From there you can climb the hills.

<p>
Theoretically, you can go down these hills from the other side through the territory of the botanical garden (by the way, a nice place, and in the evening entry to the territory is free) and go straight to the city center, but the paths on the tops of the hills are not illuminated, so we decided to go back down the same way.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255014697_9e04eeea49_o.jpg">
<p>
On the way to the center we came across a small street with a cafe called “City of Kittens”.

Another unusual place in Xiamen is the Railway Workers' Park. Itis set at the entrance and exit of an old, previously abandoned railway tunnel.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255946213_dd128d2263_o.jpg">
<p>
The tunnel itself was turned into a place for walking, all sorts of figures were placed.

<p>
There is no metro in Xiamen (probably, it is technically difficult to build one on an island?), instead they built a busway - high-speed buses. In most of the island the line runs along an overpass.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255743116_46e478c99b_o.jpg">

<p>
Just like in subways, there are turnstiles at the entrance to the station and payment is made using tokens. The price depends on the distance, and travel on the Xiamen metrobus is cheaper than most Chinese subways - starting from only 0.5 yuan, from the airport to the center (this is across the entire island with a transfer) it is 1.5 yuan.
<p/>

<p>
In Xiamen I somehow had no luck with hotels - with great difficulty we managed to rent a single room the size of one in Hong Kong for 100 yuan. But we were lucky with the food - there was a Michelin-starred establishment nearby with abnormally low prices, worthy of a separate discussion.

I should also talk about two iconic places in Xiamen: Gulangyu Island and the Minfa shopping center.
<p/>

<p>
The main attraction of Xiamen is Gulangyu Island. This is a small island located between Amoy Island and the mainland, directly opposite the historical center. In the 19th century, Europeans lived there in their own separate fenced little world. Here it is - so tempting and so inaccessible.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256787120_e82d5b31cd_o.jpg">
<p>
There is a ferry to Gulangyu from the pier near the center; it takes about five minutes to sail there. It is inexpensive - less than 10 yuan, but several years ago the Chinese decided that it would be nice to increase income from tourism, and now tickets for this ferry are sold only to the lucky owners of Xiamen registration. Everyone else is invited to make a big detour, driving 20 minutes north to the cruise terminal, and buy a ticket there for 35 yuan. Another interesting option is ferries from the mainland, which can be reached by bus across the bridge over the strait. They cost only a little less (30 yuan), but there was a bus there for 2 yuan right from my hotel, and a beautiful view from the bridge along the way.
We were unlucky with the weather.

You can take any ferry back. The one that goes to the cruise terminal runs along the business center of Xiamen.

Following a tip from Artemy Lebedev’s expedition, I visited the place that the maestro dubbed “the crappiest shopping center in the world.” Finding out the exact location was not difficult: the Mingfa shopping center is located just a couple of metrobus stops from the railway station. Externally, this complex looks like the kingdom of Chinese kitsch.

Well, that's the icing on the cake. It looked like there had once been a party in one of the rooms. Maybe even on Halloween (which takes place in the fall, and I was there in early May), judging by the decorations with skeletons.

I have a hard time imagining how you can make such a big mess. Did everyone get so drunk that they simply threw whiskey bottles on the floor and danced among them? Or was it scattered later for some reason?

I still don’t understand why this shopping center is in such a sad state. If this were an economic crisis, there would be plenty of places like this all over the country. The location near the center seems to be convenient, so I don’t know what is preventing trade there.

<h2>Nanchang</h2>
<p>
Another city I used for transit was Nanchang, the capital of Jiangxi Province. In some places here it seems that you are walking around Novosibirsk or Minsk.

On the main square there is a memorial to the Nanchang Uprising on August 1, 1927 - the first armed clash between communists and nationalists. August 1 is considered the day the Chinese Army was founded (officially called the People's Liberation Army).

<p>
To my shame, I didn’t know anything about this city, but Jingdezhen is not some provincial regional center in Jiangxi Province. In former times, it was the main center for the production of porcelain, the most valuable Chinese export during the imperial era. European traders in the 17th and 18th centuries specifically came to Jingdezhen to make purchases.

By the way, in English porcelain is sometimes simply called “china”.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256033907_47ec1a4007_o.jpg">
<p>
Now China exports other things, but Jingdezhen remains a porcelain city, where vases are sold in the markets, and even the pillars are decorated accordingly.

<h2>Huangshan</h2>
<p>
Huangshan (Yellow Mountains) is one of the most popular landscapes in China. Located in the south of Anhui Province. Logistics here are not easy. First you need to get to the city of Huangshan (formerly called Tunxi), there is a railway and an airport, direct trains to Shanghai and Nanjing. From the train station you need to take a bus to the village of Tankou, which takes about an hour. From the Tankou bus station there are shuttles directly to the entrance to the mountain, from where you need to go up by cable car or on foot. From Nanchang via Jingdezhen you can only get to Huangshan in the evening, when buses to Tankou no longer go, so I had to spend the night in the city and get up early in the morning.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256197511_707bd4d550_o.jpg">
<p>
In Tankou we quickly checked into the first hotel we came across for 80 yuan and went upstairs.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256945254_f0b076f82e_o.jpg">
<p>
We decided to walk to the entrance to see if there was a hole in the fence somewhere to bypass the ticket office.

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256396553_12c43ea9e1_o.jpg">
<p>
There is a bus road and stairs up to the entrance. There are actually two entrances: eastern and western (there is also a northern one, but you can’t get there from Tankou). At the same time, the road first comes almost close to the western one, and then turns to the eastern one, where it’s another four kilometers to go.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256396603_28b92675d2_o.jpg">
<p>
There is no way around the western entrance; there are steep slopes or fences everywhere. It was already well past noon, so we decided not to waste it in search of adventure. A ticket to Huangshan is very expensive - 240 yuan ($40), but they very easily gave us a “student” discount of 50%, and 120 yuan no longer seems like a lot. The funicular (about another 100 yuan) on the eastern slope is closed for repairs, so you can only go up on foot.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257503134_51d052e79d_o.jpg">
<p>
The walk up is 2.5 kilometers, that is, approximately like the upper section of the climb to Taishan. This time we decided to follow the example of the Chinese and use crutches bought in the city for only three yuan. When you walk, the difference is not very noticeable, but in total it is huge: the climb to Huangshan did not seem particularly difficult to me, the next day my legs did not even hurt.
<p/>

No one went up on foot, everyone only walked down. Apparently, the Chinese are aware of the repair of the funicular at the western entrance, so they come to the eastern one, go up, follow the route along the peaks and go down to the western exit. I walked the same route in the opposite direction.

In addition to the main route from the eastern entrance to the western one, you can also walk to the northern entrance (quite far), and there are a couple of side treks, such as the climb to this peak.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257800155_ae755e146a_o.jpg">

There were no adventures at the entrance, but we had a lot of them on the way out. It turned out that Huangshan is not a 24-hour park at all. There are hotels at the top, but the entrance from below is closed in the evening. There is no lighting on the stairs. There was no lighting on Taishan either, but there were many people with lanterns walking in both directions, but here there was not a single soul and dead silence. Fortunately, the charge of the gadgets was quite enough for the descent. A new obstacle awaited below: a closed gate. At the same time, there weren’t even any guards there who could let us out. I had to find a way to climb over the fence, albeit in the opposite direction. On the side of the checkpoint there was a wide fence on which you could stand. The height is 2.5 meters, that is, I would not have climbed it from the outside, but fortunately from the inside there is a low fence nearby that can be used as an intermediate platform. They loosened the ground under the fence in a very timely manner to a very soft state; jumping was not so scary.
Of course, there was no taxi at the exit, only 10 kilometers on foot to Tankou itself along the road. Fortunately, about 30 minutes later a park employee passed by and gave us a ride to Tankou, so by about 10 pm we were already at the hotel.
The next day the plan was to rest from the climb, plus move from Tankou back to the city of Huangshan, where there is a train station and you can buy tickets to Nanjing. It rained all day. The hotel in Huangshan for the standard 80 yuan ($13) was incredible. Huge room, soft beds and armchairs, the fastest internet I have ever seen in a hotel (faster than at my home in Moscow).

<h2>Nanjing</h2>
<p>
At one of the Nanjing metro stations, I noticed a billboard that showed luscious houses with tiled roofs. Quickly typing the text into the translator, I found out that the place is called “Venice City Residential Complex”, and it is located on the other side of the Yangtze River from the center of Nanjing. Moreover, one of the new metro stations was located in this area, so it was only two or three stops in a straight line from my hotel. Doesn't it seem like something interesting?

"Venice" is a fairly large area, built in the same style. If you look at the map, it will be labeled “first quarter of Venice”, “fifth quarter of Venice” and so on. It probably all started with one thing, and then it went from there. Most of the area is not particularly similar to Venice, ordinary modern houses with a small number of floors by Chinese standards.

Quite cozy and nicer than Mao Zedong-type blocks.

In the first quarter, the canals are dug, in the center there is a tower, like in the central square of Venice.

At first glance it looks good, but there is clearly not enough life in the area.

Here is the main pedestrian area. Do you see people here? I don't see them either. Of course, the weather is not great, but the cafe is also a bit empty. True, perhaps the neighborhood only comes alive in the evening, when people come home from work.

You can walk back to the center via a giant bridge over the Yangtze River. The river here is wider than in Chongqing, and the bridge itself takes about 30 minutes to cross from bank to bank, and the entrance and exit to it are kilometer and a half apart. The bridge is two-level, for cars and trains, while on the shore the tracks diverge, and the railway goes into the distance.

The Yangtze Bridge is notable for two things. Firstly, this is the first large infrastructure facility that the Chinese built themselves after the severance of relations with the USSR. At the entrances to the bridge there are glorious sculptural compositions with workers and collective farmers.

This is my village, this is my home. In this cozy area of Nanjing, where I managed to find a simple hotel for 80 yuan, I lingered a little.

It’s not difficult to get here - from the station you go west and southwest along the highway (there’s nowhere to turn anyway) to the intersection, there to the right, after the railway bridge there will be a small pedestrian bridge - that’s what you need. To the right of the exit from the hotel there was this stall where they prepared Peking duck for takeaway. It was weighed, but in fact each duck costs about 19-20 yuan ($3). This, I tell you, is heavenly pleasure. I would go to Nanjing specifically for this duck.

What can I say about Nanjing? The name of the city means “Southern capital” (Beijing is northern capital), at different periods it was the main city of China, most recently under Chiang Kai-shek, until 1937, when, due to the Japanese occupation, the government moved to Chongqing, and in 1946-1949 during the civil war. When the Japanese captured the city, the Nanjing massacre occurred - an event for which the Chinese especially want to make the Japanese repent, and the Japanese pretend that nothing particularly beyond the scope of the war happened.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255800987_143440532f_o.jpg">
<p>
It is not clear where such bitterness came from that the Japanese soldiers slaughtered and shot everyone indiscriminately. The Chinese did nothing bad to the Japanese, and the military clashes that preceded the capture of Nanjing can hardly be called long and difficult for the Japanese army.

By the way, one of the very few places in China where you can see the flag of the Republic of China (now the flag of Taiwan).

Nanjing also has a fairly large old city (apparently, much renovated, like almost everywhere else in China).

In different places you can find city walls. The area inside the walls is huge, no less than in Xi'an. It is clearly noticeable that in the Middle Ages and later the population of Chinese cities was significantly larger than European ones, if so many people were placed inside the walls.
