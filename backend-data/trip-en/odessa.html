<h1>Ukraine: Odesa</h1>
<i>2-3 February 2013</i>
<h2>Odesa</h2>
<p>
In Chernomorsk, roofs rattled and drafts ran through the streets. By the force of the southeast wind that unexpectedly attacked the city, winter was driven to the trash cans, gutters and ledges of houses. There it died among pieces of ice falling out of drainpipes and torn tram tickets. Cold chrysanthemums were drowning in the bowls of flower girls. The green shutters of the closed kvass booths slammed. The pigeons said “I’ll die, I’ll die.” The sparrows warmed themselves by pecking at hot dung. The people wandered against the wind, heads down, like bulls. The pique vests fared the worst. The wind tore off their boaters and Panama hats and rolled them along the parquet pavement down to the boulevard. The old men ran after them, out of breath and indignant. The sidewalk whirlwinds swept the pursuers themselves so hard that they sometimes overtook their hats and came to their senses only when they touched the wet feet of the bronze figure of Catherine’s nobleman standing in the middle of the square.

In the city center there are maps for English-speaking tourists.

The streets here are cleaned well, but the parks are not, you have to walk through puddles.
</p>

The park offers excellent views of the port.

It turned out that in the cargo ports there are huge parallelepiped containers, painted in different colors and with the name of the owner company. I have been to military ports (Feodosia, Sevastopol), and to cargo ports only once, quite recently, in Montevideo.

With my boots soaking wet, I reached the beach, a typical Black Sea beach with pebbles and muddy water.

It must be unbearable on the beach in summer, but now there are only seagulls.

Trade in Odessa is thriving. There are even shops here with “confiscated goods,” apparently, things that were taken away by customs officers at the port.

Banks are offering interest rates on deposits in hryvnia that are unprecedented by Russian standards. Unfortunately, such offers are available only to citizens of Ukraine, otherwise it would be profitable to put money on deposits in Ukraine and then transfer it back into rubles, because the hryvnia to ruble exchange rate changes little, obviously not by 20%. Or even put it on a deposit in dollars at 9%, this is also super profitable.

The local population is not very fond of photography; you have to take pictures furtively.

In many Odessa stores, the entrance is below the sidewalk level, and a winding staircase leads to it.

Odessa is not like the typical resort cities of Crimea and the Krasnodar Krai in that its houses are mostly 2-3-4-storey, not private. Several families live in one house, so there are separate apartments and approaches to them. Visually, the backyards of Odessa are somewhat subtly reminiscent of the favelas in Rio de Janeiro. If Odessa stood on the slope of a mountain, it would be almost similar.

This, by the way, is Malaya Arnautskaya Street, where, according to O. Bender, all the smuggling is done.

The pieces are being adjusted to the house, the stairs lead somewhere into the unknown.

The interiors of the houses are approximately the same as in unrenovated Moscow or St. Petersburg pre-revolutionary houses. Attention to high ceilings, wooden doors.

In every dead end there will definitely be a dump of old things.

As in many southern cities, grapes are considered an ornamental plant and no one even thinks about picking the berries.

A big plus of Odessa is that local residents clearly love cats more than dogs.

The laundry, as expected, is dried right outside. In Moscow, by the way, this can also be seen if you know where to look.

Mail is still held in high esteem here, mailboxes hang everywhere, and the names of the residents are written on them.

Some entrances, like shops, are located just below ground level.

In the spring in Odesa, you can see round pieces of ice falling from drainpipes.

And here is Moldavanka, a district adored by Kostya the Sailor (from a popular song). Here the houses are one-story, and the courtyards are fenced with a regular fence. But this cannot be called the "private sector", because... The houses have almost no plots of land and they are closely adjacent to each other.

It looks much poorer than the center.

A strange house on high stilts. I don’t know what it’s for, but the local kids must definitely enjoy climbing in there.

No one is afraid of laundry theft.

In general, the city is great. I'll have to come here again.
