<h1>Northern Mariana Islands</h1>
<i>16-17 June 2019</i>
<p>
The Northern Mariana Islands are a US overseas territory in Micronesia. Until the end of the 19th century, they belonged to Spain, then Germany bought them, after Germany’s defeat in World War I, the islands were transferred to Japan, which developed them well, but lost them in 1945 to the United States. As in <a href="http://goo.gl/uMEDaE">Puerto Rico</a> and <a href="http://goo.gl/MNjaFE">Virgin Islands</a>, local residents have US citizenship, but do not have representation in federal government bodies and do not participate in presidential elections. When flying from the mainland US territory (there are direct flights from Hawaii), there is no passport control, but there is customs control. It’s a long way from the USA, and it’s expensive to fly, so to develop tourism, practical Americans sacrificed the sacred inviolability of borders and abolished visas on the islands for residents of all four nearby large countries: the Japanese and Koreans don’t need it anyway, and the Russians and Chinese have a special visa-free regime.
There are many Northern Mariana Islands, but only three are inhabited, and 90% of the population lives on the largest - Saipan.

I arrived in Saipan from Hong Kong at 5 am. There is almost no public transport on the island. It seems like there is one line in the capital area, opened only in 2018 and with a frequency of once every 2 hours. I thought, why not kill a lot of time before checking into the hotel and walk to the city? Fortunately, my backpack was not particularly heavy, and early in the morning it was not hot outside. I covered the distance to the city of about 12 kilometers in three and a half hours. At the same time I saw virtually the entire southern populated part of the island.
The airport is built in the shape of the traditional houses of the islands' indigenous population.

<p>
The roads in Saipan are not of the best quality, especially away from the main highway.

<p>
Along the way, every now and then we come across abandoned buildings with broken windows. It turned out that in October 2018, Saipan was very badly damaged by a typhoon, which hit the southern part of the island the hardest (while the neighboring island of Guam was not damaged).

<p>
In the south of the island there are quite a lot of areas overgrown with tall grass along the roads.

<p>
Crossroads. As in the USA, here traffic lights are hung on long horizontal poles above the road. Perhaps the presence of traffic lights in itself is also atypical for small countries in Oceania.

The traffic light for pedestrians is a 100% American model, like in any US city.

Bus stops advertise McDonald's. These are school bus stops, there are no public ones here.

I reached Susupe - the second largest settlement on the island. It looks something like this, even without the typhoon it wasn’t much fun.

Such a colorful corner! If it were not for the English language, one would think that this was in the Russian province 15 years ago before the casinos were banned. But no, this is America.

Here is America too, with decorations made from tires. Definitely America, in Russia they don’t stick American flags in the ground.

The remaining route from Susupe to Garapan (the capital of the island) goes along the coast. There are a couple of large hotels here that I haven’t visited, and many wild beaches.

The beach is quite nice for a wild one, only a little grass grows here and there.

A hundred meters from the shore, an American tank was shot down under water. In 1944 there was a large-scale battle for Saipan.

This huge casino towers high above all other buildings. The "Chinese Baroque" style is reminiscent of <a href="http://goo.gl/SV5h99">Macau</a>.

The second building is still under construction, and the area in front of the casino is littered with construction debris.

Also on this remote island in the middle of the ocean there are stores of Louis Vuitton, Gucci and other luxury brands. People actually buy there. Why? There are such stores in Japan and Korea too, and the prices are probably lower there.

My hotel is also typically Chinese. The cheapest room on Saipan costs $50, there are a couple of hostels for $20-25 per bed.

In Garapan, in addition to McDonald's, you can eat at Chinese eateries. Prices are affordable at 5-7 dollars.

Stores accept food stamps. For a long time, migrant labor was exploited in Saipan because US minimum wage laws did not apply there. Saipan was similar to the UAE or Qatar in that there were many migrant workers who had no chance of naturalization. Then this business was closed, and the island is now reoriented towards tourism.

To see the northern part of the island, I needed to buy an excursion, because taxis in Saipan are prohibitively expensive. I walked around Garapan twice and found only one place that offered tours, and only in Chinese. Well, why not in Chinese? The excursion cost only $25 and was conducted in a roomy eight-seater passenger car. I also saw large 50-seater buses in parking lots; you can probably get on them through guides in large hotels.

Saipan's most famous landmark is Suicide Rock. In 1944, several hundred Japanese soldiers and their families committed suicide by jumping from this cliff.

More precisely, there are two different rocks, one by the sea and called Banzai Cliff in English:

The flight from Saipan to the island of Guam (200 km, 40 minutes travel time) is operated by the American airline United. Surprisingly, on such a short flight they use a huge Boeing 737 aircraft. That's because that flight to Guam is part of a chain of flights connecting all the main islands of Micronesia: Saipan, Guam, Chuuk, Pohnpei, Kwajalein, Majuro and finally the Hawaiian Islands. There are also flights from Guam to the islands of Yap and Palau. There are simply no other flights to the mainland from this region (except for Palau, where there are flights from Korea), so all residents of Micronesian countries fly this way. This flight is popular among airline enthusiasts who at times travel from Honolulu to Guam without even stopping at the intermediate islands. A ticket to Guam costs $120, and then each subsequent flight costs 400-500 each, so you can fly relatively inexpensively only with bonus miles, although I don’t know how to get so many United miles without living in the USA.
