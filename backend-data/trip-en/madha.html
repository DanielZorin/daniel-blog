<h1>Oman: Madha</h1>
<i>7 May 2018</i>
<h2>Madha</h2>
<p>
When the borders of the emirates were determined, the village of Madha, surrounded on all sides by the Emirate of Fujairah, swore allegiance to the Sultan of Oman. As a result, this strange exclave is still preserved - a place where you can visit Oman without a visa. In general, Oman has been easy to visit since 2017: they began to allow people to go there with a Schengen visa, and they used to offer visa-free excursions to Musandam, a semi-exclave on the edge of the cape north of the UAE (price around $70-80). But due to the spontaneity and shortness of the trip to the UAE, I didn’t have time for Oman this time, but why not visit an unusual place - a geopolitical incident, and at the same time  1 new country?

That was the plan. From Sharjah there are direct buses to Khor Fakkan, an east coast city that is an exclave of the Emirate of Sharjah within the Emirate of Fujairah. Not reaching 15 kilometers to Khor Fakkan, I got off on the highway in the suburbs, and there I wanted to catch a taxi to Madha, which was 5-6 kilometers away. It was easy to find a taxi, but it turned out that Emirati taxis are not allowed to enter the territory of Oman, because insurance is not valid there. There are no taxis in Madha itself because it is a small village and everyone there has a car. What to do? I had to ask the driver to park at the “border” and walk to Oman. Here is the entrance to Omani territory, there is a portrait of the Sultan and the inscription “Oman” in Arabic.

Here's a closer look at the entrance. It says "Oman welcomes you" at the bottom.

And now I’m already walking on Omani soil! There are no border guards here, but my status is still unclear. In principle, I had a Schengen visa, but I did not go through border formalities, a kind of catch 22.

A food stall and some kind of establishment. I didn’t want to attract the attention of the police and officials, and this is not so easy to do when you are the only pedestrian in the area.

Immediately behind the bushes there is a large wasteland. In general, Madha is not such a small territory (10 by 10 kilometers, but only a small part is inhabited, the rest is desert. Surprisingly, inside this exclave there is a second-level exclave - the territory of the UAE Nahwa.

Nahwa is located a little further up the mountain.

Flowering bushes grow along the road.

Lanterns with crowns, like in Malaysia.

Here I am as close as possible to Madha. It can be seen that there are the same houses as in the UAE, a mosque, construction.

To the right of the road there is also an unpaved runway.

From here I had another 20 minutes to walk back to the car in the heat.

<p>
Bye Oman! Someday I can come there more thoroughly, but for now this turns out to be my shortest visit to any country.
