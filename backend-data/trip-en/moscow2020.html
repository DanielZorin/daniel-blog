<h1>Russia: all districts of Moscow</h1>
<i>10 June - 7 October 2020</i>
<h2>Moscow</h2>
<p>
A new line appeared in the Moscow metro in 2019, and a couple of days before the quarantine, new stations were opened on it, bringing it close to the center. The new line leads to the Nekrasovka district, which is considered one of the worst places to live due to air pollution. Nekrasovka was originally a settlement at a wastewater treatment plant, and was part of Moscow as an exclave, but in 2011, the Lyubertsy Fields wasteland was added to Nekrasovka, and it connected with the rest of Moscow through the Kosino-Ukhtomsky district located outside the Moscow Ring Road. Lyubertsy fields were built up with high-rise buildings, and now there is a metro here.

The Butovo district has historically had a bad reputation, probably because in the 90s it was almost the most remote area (along with Solntsevo) with massive development (unlike other areas extending beyond the Moscow Ring Road). In reality, Butovo is now a fairly civilized and settled area; by today’s standards, it is no longer particularly new. Transport accessibility is much better thanks to the Butovskaya metro line, although the journey to the center is still quite long. Initially, the Butovskaya line was an “addendum” to the gray line, and only 10 years later, in 2014, it was extended to also intersect with the orange line - at the Novoyasenevskaya station, which was formerly called “Bitsevsky Park”.

<p>
After crossing the gray line, the trains go above the surface until the very end. Until 2014, the Butovskaya line was officially considered unequal to the others, and was called the “light metro”; on the maps it was designated as a contour line rather than a solid line, like the monorail.

In the summer of 2020, I came up with a challenge - to visit all districts of Moscow. This task is not so simple. Moscow is divided into 12 administrative <i>okrugs</i>, and those into as many as 125 districts (<i>rayon</i>) and 21 settlements (in New Moscow - territories annexed in 2012). I have been to all administrative okrugs in one way or another, but at the district level everything is not so simple. Having looked more closely at the districts and their borders, I discovered that I was in less than half, and this is even taking into account all the adventures with visiting Lenin monuments in industrial zones. I think the vast majority of Moscow residents have been to a maximum of 40-50 districts. In some areas I was passing through: for example, only at the metro station; I have been to some places, but a very long time ago (for example, in Zelenograd). I planned to take a walk in such places again.
The only okrug where I was in all 10 districts is, of course, the Central. It is clear that there are many attractions there, and you can talk about each district at length and in detail. So I went through the rest of the districts, divided by cardinal directions, and started with the North-East, since I live there myself. NE okrug is the top of the orange and gray metro lines (<i>In Moscow metro, lines have lengthy official names, but all the locals call them by colors, maybe except for a few new lines that appeared only in the last 5 years</i>), as well as a piece of light green, which then goes to the Northern District. There are 17 districts in the North-East - more than in any other okrug. Among the famous attractions here are the territory of VDNKh and the Ostankino TV tower.
<p/>

I have already repeatedly shown the views from Northern Medvedkovo, as well as the park along the Yauza, but there are not many other attractions in this area. The coat of arms of North-East Administrative Okrug hangs on my house and is illuminated at night.

There are several schools in the area, I sometimes pass by them on the way through the yards, and I noticed that each one has a branded sign that says “I love X.”

And now we go to South Medvedkovo. I’ve never been there - my house is at the opposite end of the north-south border, and there is no metro in South Medvedkovo (it’s somewhere between the Medvedkovo, Sviblovo and Bibirevo stations). There's a bear standing here.

I walked around for a long time, trying to guess which republic was which, but it was far from obvious.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256473661_6a87e7e126_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Interestingly, there are 16 sculptures - when the fountain was created, Karelia was a union republic (it was raised to this status before the war with Finland in 1939, and later returned back to Russia).

The monorail line, the most controversial Moscow transport, begins near VDNKh.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256674043_9d0a19dcd6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The monorail was built under Luzhkov (mayor in the 1990's and early 2000's) purely for fun. It is expensive to operate, so they have been trying to close it for a long time, but have not done so yet, although in recent years trains have been running once every 30 minutes.

<p>
There is not much practical sense in a monorail. There is one section where it passes over the railway, connecting areas between which there are almost no other connections, but it would be possible to build a bridge for a tram there too.

There is also a good view of VDNKh from above, but still this is not enough for it to be worthwhile as a tourist attraction.

The monorail goes across the railway to the Butyrsky district. There was no hole in the fence, so I had to make a detour and go around.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257227884_52df610287_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Butyrsky district is sandwiched between two railways. Previously, it was served by the Timiryazevskaya station (which is already in the Northern okrug), but now there are two more stations of the light green line - Butyrskaya and Fonvizinskaya. Half of the district is occupied by all sorts of factories, for example a processed cheese factory.
<p/>

Near it stands a monument to the Druzhba ("firendship") cheese. It was absent for a long time due to the construction of the metro, but at the end of August 2020 it was returned to the square.

In the territories of the North-Eastern District, before inclusion into Moscow, in addition to villages, there was one full-fledged city - Losinoostrovsk, later renamed Babushkin. Its center was near the Losinoostrovskaya train station, on both sides of the road. Now, on one side, these are the Losinoostrovsky and Babushkinsky districts, and on the other, the Yaroslavsky district. The monument to Lenin at the station was, it turns out, the main city monument on the central square.

Behind the railway is the Yaroslavl district - not the best place in terms of transport accessibility. There is no metro nearby, the area is sandwiched between the railway and Losiny Ostrov park. Residential areas are mainly along the Yaroslavl highway, and then there are only some garages, car washes and other infrastructure for cars. There is also a civil engineering university (MGSU) here.

The Otradnoye district is the most populated district of the North-East okrug and is one of the five most populated in Moscow.

Finally, the most unusual and inaccessible region of NE okrug is called “Northern” / Severny. This is one of the areas of Moscow beyond the Moscow Ring Road. It adjoins the edge of the Lianozovo district. There is no metro in Severny (although a new terminal station of the light green line is planned there), but there are MCD trains exactly along the border with the city <a href="../moscow-region2020">Dolgoprudny</a>. Severny was annexed to Moscow in 1984 (before that, the city border ran everywhere exactly along the Moscow Ring Road   Zelenograd), but in the 2000s it was a village.

The Eastern Administrative Okrug is the largest in area (not counting New Moscow), the second in population, but one of the last in population density: a significant part of the district is occupied by the Losiny Ostrov park, Izmailovo, and Sokolniki parks. The red, blue, yellow and a small part of Nekrasovskaya metro lines pass here. I have already written about the hike <a href="../moscow2019">along the yellow line</a> (Perovo, Novogireevo, Ivanovskoe districts), went to <a href="../moscow2018">Sokolniki</a>, Sokolinaya Gora and Izmailovo; The Eastern Administrative District also includes two exclaves: <a href="../moscow-region2019">Vostochny</a> and <a href="../moscow2020">Nekrasovka</a>. In total, half of the work was already done, and I went to the area of ​​​​the final stations of the red line.
<p/>

<p>
Further east is the Metrogorodok district. It got its name because the builders of the first metro line lived here, but there are no stations here. It is also the largest district in Moscow by area (not counting New Moscow) and the second from the bottom in terms of population density. The answer is simple - this area includes most of the Losiny Ostrov park within the Moscow Ring Road, and there are very few residential areas, but there are many enterprises. Perhaps the population density will soon increase, as active construction is underway on the border with Bogorodskoye.
<p/>

There are three Izmailovo districts in Moscow. All the most interesting things are in Izmailovo proper: the estate on the island, the Kremlin, Izmailovo Park. Northern Izmailovo is a narrow strip between Shchelkovskoye Highway and Sirenevy Boulevard, and Eastern Izmailovo is a residential area east of the Pervomaiskaya metro station. Finding attractions in these areas is not easy.

The South-Eastern okrug has a bad reputation as dirty and dysfunctional. There are no popular attractions here, but there are many hot spots: Nekrasovka, Kapotnya, <a href="../moscow2018">Moscow shopping center in Lyublino</a>, the Sadovod market, < a href="../moscow2018">Kuryanovo</a>, <a href="../moscow2018">Karacharovo</a> , the notorious Vykhino station. The bottom of the purple and light green lines, as well as most of the new Nekrasovskaya line, pass through the SE okrug. Minus the places I had been before, there were two groups of districts, each along a metro line. Let's start with the purple line, at the same time looking at the new stations of the Nekrasovskaya line, which runs almost parallel here. The Okskaya station is decorated in an avant-garde manner.

It’s literally about 500 meters to get to the Ryazansky Prospekt station on the purple line, but there is no underground passage, however, it’s not really needed - there is a passage through two stations. I have already been to this area during a walk through Kuzminki Park.

The next station is called South-East (Yugo-Vostochnaya), as opposed to South-West on the red line. The decor is nice.

Vykhino station, famous for overcrowding during rush hours. Previously, there was an oriental bazaar and a bus station near it, but after the line was extended to Kotelniki station, the buses moved there, and the bazaar was dispersed, now the square looks empty.

From here I decided to walk to the Stakhanovskaya metro station on the Nekrasovskaya line. It turned out that soon behind the house a huge industrial zone begins, which is now being partially rebuilt into a residential area.

The second half of the SE okrug is located along the light green metro line. I remember when I was little and learned all the metro stations, this line had just appeared (in 1995), on the diagram there were almost more stations under construction than existing ones. Their names also changed constantly. Now it is a full-fledged line from the north to the south of the city. There are five districts in the SE okrug: the already familiar <a href="../moscow2018">Lyublino and Pechatniki</a>, as well as three new ones. First I stopped in the Yuzhnoportovy (South Port) district (Dubrovka and Kozhukhovskaya metro stations).
<p/>

<p>
On Dubrovka, I was actually once in the neighboring shopping center, so I chose Kozhukhovskaya to begin with. The place is very uncomfortable. Right next to the metro there are a bunch of car shopping complexes with huge parking lots.

<p>
On the other side is the Nagatinsky Zaton district (Southern okrug). Directly ahead you can see Beaver Island - an uninhabited and inaccessible island formed in the 19th century after the construction of a dam. Sand from the southern port was stored there for some time, and then it was removed, and beavers occupied the territory. You can only get to the island by water, and formally this is generally prohibited. It seems that in winter there is a better chance of getting there on ice.

From here, the first thing I did was take a bus to the area considered the worst in Moscow - Kapotnya.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256483346_44ebe4c304_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Kapotnya has two disadvantages. Firstly, there are only two roads from this area - to the Moscow Ring Road and towards Maryino, and even without Kapotnya they are quite busy. Secondly, the Moscow oil refinery is located here. Because of this, the air here is dirty.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255755192_9edf7ffbca_h.jpg"/>

Although now there is a whole screen hanging on the fence of the plant, showing that air pollution is a thing of the past.

The Southern Administrative Okrug was the least familiar to me: while in the South-Eastern Okrug I visited monuments to Lenin, in the Southern Administrative Okrug there are almost none of them, and somehow I have never been to the local residential areas either. As a result, out of 16 districts, I was only in four: two adjacent to the center, as well as in Kolomenskoye Park (Nagatinsky Zaton district) and Tsaritsyno Park (Orekhovo-Borisovo Northern district). The gray and green lines, as well as the very end of the light green line, pass through the Southern Administrative District. Exploring this okrug took me the longest - five trips. First, I took a ride to the district closest to the center - Donskoy.

Opposite the Danilov Monastery is the Moscow refrigeration equipment plant. I don’t understand whether it works or not, but the access control regime remains in place on the territory, although there are many shops there, you can pretend that you are going to one of them.

The Danilovsky district also includes a rather large territory across the river, in the area of ​​the ZIL plant and Avtozavodskaya station. There was another ancient Moscow monastery there - Simonovsky. It was demolished under Soviet rule, leaving only the southern wall with three towers and one church.

The neighboring area (Nagatinsky Zaton) includes the famous <a href="../moscow2018">Kolomenskoye Park</a>, I thought about skipping it, but I thought that it would not be possible to study the Southern okrug complete without the backwater (zaton) itself, which once was near the current Technopark metro station.

We are moving to the southern part of the Southern okrug. There are three Chertanovo, two Biryulyovo and two Orekhovo-Borisovo. Three Chertanovo (North, Central and South) stretch along the gray line and five metro stations, which I had never been to before.

Northern Chertanovo was built as an “exemplary and promising residential area” in the late 70s - early 80s.

This area has large and green courtyards, almost no cars. Initially, the houses had underground parking lots (which were never done in Soviet houses), and there were underground passages.

Also in Northern Chertanovo there is the longest house in Moscow, nicknamed the “Recumbent Skyscraper”. This is the Research Center for Electronic Computing Technology. I was never able to find an angle from which I could see both ends of this house - its length is almost 750 meters.

Podolsk Cadets Street is one of the few entrances to the Biryulyovo district, which has a bad reputation. Biryulyovo is a triangle between the railway to Podolsk (now MCD-2) in the west, the Moscow Ring Road in the south and a large forest park in the east. In the middle, another railway runs as a bisector, dividing Biryulyovo into Eastern and Western, between which there is no direct road (only on foot). There is no metro here either (the line is planned after 2025), so you need to leave from here either to Prazhskaya (from the west) or to Tsaritsyno/Kantemirovskaya (from the east), or by train to Paveletsky station or along MCD-2. In Western Biryulyovo, half of the territory is occupied by factories and warehouses.

On the northern edge of the Eastern Biryulyovo district there are some exits from the Tsaritsyno metro station and the entrance to the museum-reserve of the same name with a palace. The palace itself on the other side of the river is already part of the Orekhovo-Borisovo Northern district. The Tsaritsyno district was left with only a crown on its emblem.

Krasnogvardeiskaya station is the penultimate station on the green line. From 2011 to 2012, there was a unique situation when two terminal stations (of the green and light green lines) had an interchange, later Krasnogvardeiskaya became the penultimate station, but still, an interchange so far from the center is an infrequent occurrence (although with the Nekrasovskaya line there is a transfer as far away as MKAD).

The emblem of the southern part of the district is on the end of the building near the Domodedovskaya metro station. On the house opposite there hangs the coat of arms of the northern part, and buses to Domodedovo airport depart from there, so I’ve been to this place many times.

The southwest of Moscow is considered the most expensive and prestigious place after the center. But the trick is that in everyday life Muscovites mean by “southwest” mainly the Ramenki district (where Moscow State University, Vorobyovy Gory and Mosfilm are), and the Yugo-Zapadnaya metro station, and all this is located in the Western okrug. The South-Western okrug is geographically more southern than western, and is located along the orange metro line (and a little along the gray one). Also included in the South-Western okrug are <a href="../moscow2020">Northern and Southern Butovo</a>. There are no famous sights in thisokrug, but I visited three districts many times during my studies, since the Gagarinsky and Lomonosovsky districts start almost immediately from the University metro station, and in the Academichesky district at the metro station of the same name I went to the pool and to my first office work. So we start from the farthest part, the Yasenevo district.

The Western okrug was the second terra incognita for me after the Southern, not counting, of course, the Moscow State University area. The Western District is the bottom of the red line, almost the entire “new” yellow line (Solntsevskaya), as well as the left part of the dark blue and light blue lines. For a long time, the dark blue line ended at Kievskaya, and the light blue line was long, but after the appearance of the Kievskaya - Victory Park - Slavyansky Boulevard - Kuntsevskaya section at the end of the 2000s, the blue line became an incomprehensible stump. There are 13 districts in this okrug, of which I was in three along the red line, <a href="../moscow2018">Novo-Peredelkino</a>, and of course in Dorogomilovo (district Kievsky railway station and Poklonnaya Gora) and <a href="../moscow2018">Filyovsky Park</a>. We start from Solntsevo - this is a residential area outside the Moscow Ring Road, where the yellow metro line runs.

Further inside the Moscow Ring Road on one side is the Ochakovo highway, on the other - Troparevo-Nikulino. The most interesting thing here is the 1980 Olympic Village.

To the north of the Olympic Village, the very large Ochakovo-Matveevskoe district begins. These are two relatively small residential areas at a decent distance from each other and a huge industrial zone, probably the largest in Moscow. Ochakovo is closer to the yellow metro line, Matveevskoye is closer to the dark blue line, people usually go there via Slavyansky Boulevard.

<p>
In Matveevskoe there is an unusual round (more precisely, ring) panel house. It was an architectural experiment, which in the end was considered not very successful - due to the closed courtyard it was too noisy, and it was inconvenient to make repairs due to the non-standard shape of the apartments. There are only two such houses, the second one is not far from here in the Ramenki area near Mosfilmovskaya Street.

During the expansion of Moscow in 2012, in addition to the creation of the Novomoskovsky and Troitsky okrugs, the Western and South-Eastern districts were also expanded, however, no new districts were added to them: the territory of Nekrasovka, as well as the Kuntsevo and Mozhaisky districts, increased. The areas added are called "separate sites" and are mostly empty. The Rublevo-Arkhangelskoye site near Krasnogorsk is occupied by a proposed new business district complementing the City. The “Stud farm, VTB” site is a piece of the Odintsovo district, allocated so as to go around all the villages there and include only empty land. And the third site, as part of the Mozhaisky district, is the Skolkovo innovation center, where construction has been underway since 2012. There is already something to see in Skolkovo, and there is an MCD station there.

The road from the station to the facilities is as ill-conceived as possible; you need to make a huge detour, so all normal people go straight down, which is clearly visible on the trampled grass.

Apparently, it was designed by people who drive cars and like to make circles and spirals around all sorts of junctions. At the same time, the problem is only near the station; further closer to the university everything is more or less normal.

Let's now look at the main part of the Mozhaisky district. There is no metro here, but there are two MCD stations: Setun and Rabochy Poselok. Before being included in Moscow in 1960, this was the main part of the city of Kuntsevo. Unofficially, this area was called "Limonia Country" (Lemon country) because the houses were painted yellow.

The North-Western okrug consists of only 8 districts, smaller than the others (except for Zelenogradsky), however, the area of ​​​​these districts is rather large. This is half of the purple line and the very top of the blue line. I partially explored this part of Moscow when I lived nearby in Krasnogorsk, so the district is not completely foreign to me, although from Medvedkovo it is the most inconvenient part of Moscow to get to. On the way to Strogino, I set a record - in 90 minutes I managed to travel on five routes and four types of transport: metro, MCC, electric bus and two buses, and one of the buses also replaced a tram that was temporarily out of order.

<p>
But in the southern part of Strogino there is a most interesting place - the village of Troitse-Lykovo. This is the only surviving village in Moscow (inside the Moscow Ring Road) with real wooden houses. Previously, there was also the village of Terekhovo, also in the North-Western Administrative District further along the river, but in 2020 it was finally demolished. Troitse-Lykovo has a protected status, so mass development is not planned here yet.

There is also a hidden metro station in Troitse-Lykovo. The Strogino - Krylatskoye section is the longest in the metro, and it partially breaks it up. The station is technical, only metro employees can enter it, and the platform there is made narrow, but with the prospect of expansion if necessary. It seems that according to the plans, in 5 years a new line will be built connecting the Business Center and Rublevo-Arkhangelskoye, and it will also pass nearby.

Festival site. Exactly the same as in Northern Butovo. Taking a closer look, I realized that it symbolizes Moscow, or rather the Stalinist Empire style.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256695293_50c918dfae_h.jpg"/>

Metro Planernaya. Near the shopping center there is a bus terminal, fenced off from the street - the entrance is only through the shopping center, and there are even some kind of turnstiles prepared there (but they are always open). This is the first time in Russia that I have come across such a design.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257537240_30a8febe9d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
From Planernaya I took a bus to Kurkino - a remote area outside the Moscow Ring Road without a metro. I thought this would be an ordinary residential area like Mitino or Nekrasovka, but it turned out that the architecture here is quite diverse, and part of the area is generally built up with townhouses and private houses.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257537305_66225ff162_h.jpg"/>

The last place left was the Northern okrug. On my trips here, I actively used the MCC, but in general, half of the green line and, recently, the uppermost part of the light green line run through here. There are 16 districts in the okrug, of which I will skip <a href="../moscow2014">Timiryazevsky</a> and <a href="../moscow-region2019">Molzhaninovsky</a>. Let's start with the part closest to the center, which actually has a lot of interesting places. I started from the Dynamo metro station.
<p/>

Monument to Lenin in honor of his visit to the airfield. Until 1948, Moscow's main airport was located at the Aeroport metro station.

The far part of the Northern okrug is divided into two parts: areas along the green metro line, and a piece enclosed between the MKAD, Leningradskaya and Savelovskaya railways, an analogue of Biryulyovo, only mirrored to the northern part of Moscow. Recently metro appeared here, and in a couple of years there will be more, as the light green line will be extended by three more stations. I don’t have the most pleasant memories associated with this part of Moscow, since I used to be here only to get a driver’s license at the local traffic police. There are four districts: East and West Degunino on the edges, Beskudnikovo and Dmitrovsky in the middle.
