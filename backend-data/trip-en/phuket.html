<h1>Thailand: Ratchaburi, Phetchaburi, Hua Hin, humphon, Phang Nga, Phuket</h1>
<i>12-22 October 2015</i>
<h2>Ratchaburi</h2>
<p>
As a rule, at the bus station there is a map of the region indicating attractions. Even in this non-tourist region (although there is a floating market, to which excursions are brought from Bangkok).
<p/>

<p>
I was passing through here towards Hua Hin. I walked around the market.
<p/>

<p>
Watermelons are stacked like shells.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256881438_610ea01a26_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The market is a wholesale market, with entire sections dedicated to one product. There is a section where everyone sells longan.
<p/>

<p>
And here are sugar apples.

<p>
I've seen pillars like this somewhere before.

<h2>Phetchaburi</h2>
<p>
I was passing through this city on my way from Kanchanaburi to Hua Hin. It turned out that this is quite an interesting city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256641101_644d4cdefe_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the center there is a mountain on which stands a royal palace and a couple of temples. I'll have to go upstairs some other time.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256641156_8fb6c9b119_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are monkeys at the entrance to the mountain.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255912852_54c0488200_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are many unusual temples here besides the mountain. First of all, this one.
<p/>

<p/>

<p>
The monastery is in the style of the main temples of Ayutthaya during its heyday.

On one side there is a temple, on the other side there is a temple.

<p>
Then I went to Hua Hin by train - from the city center and much cheaper than a bus.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257684025_5d74d6d068_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Hua Hin</h2>
<p>
Hua Hin is considered a relatively expensive resort (compared to Pattaya, the islands are still more expensive). The beach here looks very attractive and photogenic.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257241265_3b4cb66cb1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But I didn’t like swimming here at all - there are a lot of rocks and sharp stones in the sea, the water is muddy. Fail.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257241315_f3ffddc23f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
These stones can be seen even from the shore.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256397543_30861c7958_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But the beach is nice, yes.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256397643_ddda497f27_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And there are no problems with space. Though, it is inconvenient to get to the beach - there is a huge Hilton hotel along the shore, you need to go around its territory if you live in the city center. Despite the fact that there is nothing fenced on the beach - in Thailand all the beaches are state-owned, it is impossible to grab a piece of the shore.
<p/>

<p/>

<p>
Hua Hin city is very densely built up with hotels and restaurants.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256946139_1c9f233886_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Residents of northern European countries like to hang out here; many signs are duplicated in Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish, German, and Danish.
<p/>

Oktoberfest.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257240910_f3e8ceb989_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are very few Russians. I saw only one Russian restaurant, and it seemed to be closed forever.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256198186_2288caa917_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Tourist restaurants are quite expensive by Thai standards (1 dollar = 35 baht).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256946564_9e8aab4b78_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You'll have to pay extra for European breakfast food.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256198611_4958742c04_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But further from the coast, I easily found a Thai canteen with regular prices of 30-40 baht per dish. Pad thai, mmm.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256946244_91afb53559_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a royal palace in Hua Hin, but it is not a tourist attraction - the late Rama IX lived there most of the time in recent years. The area is fenced off, nothing is visible.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256397458_ec4f0cab19_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Alleys around.

<p>
Beach near the royal palace. This is a residential area, there are no hotels, no people.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256946304_104927a8bd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The Hilton in the city center is visible in the distance.

Hua Hin has one of the most beautiful train stations in Thailand.

<h2>Chumphon</h2>
<p>
The main (and the only) attraction of the city of Chumphon is the Chumphon Hotel. For just 200 baht you can travel back to the 19th century!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257069880_5534cc5860_h.jpg"/>
<p>
What impressed me most was the chamber pot in the corner.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256226653_e7f936752d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Among the attributes of the 20th century there is a TV.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256774289_2fb77299bd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is only one socket and it is very flimsy. However, electricity already existed in the 19th century.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256226588_6a1a0567d4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Hall. There is no roof over it, so when it rains the floor floods.

<p>
The city of Chumphon seemed somehow gloomy to me.
<p/>

<p>
I went to the market looking for durians, but there were none.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256774584_d11ad68557_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Six months later, I suddenly found myself passing through this city again (the cheapest train from Bangkok to Chumphon costs less than 100 baht), and again checked into the same hotel. I didn’t find anything new, except that I saw metal seagulls sitting on local poles.

The street sign is dull.
<p/>

<h2>Phang Nga</h2>
<p>
Phang Nga Bay is the Thai version of Vietnamese <a href="../hanoi">Ha Long Bay</a> with karst cliffs in the middle of the sea.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257681630_7321154738_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The popular resort of Phuket is nearby, from where excursions arrive daily. I took an unconventional path and settled on the mainland in the city also called Phang Nga. You won’t be able to save much on this: a tour of the islands cost 1,100 baht, in Phuket it’s 100-200 baht more expensive. But this allowed me to gain time without spending two hours on the way there and back. In addition, there were only 4 people in the group, while the boats from Phuket were packed to capacity.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256839993_e04c14575e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The road from the mainland begins in dense thickets of mangrove trees.
<p/>

Tourists are transported on small motor boats.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257385544_c8ee898fe3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are rocks even in the city center, and near the coast too, of course.

<p>
We go out into the bay.

<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256639136_a1a07a1cc5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
We approach the most famous place - Khao Phing Kan Island, popularly known as "James Bond Island".
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257385764_e547564215_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The film "The Man with the Golden Gun" was filmed here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257008153_4314f5e279_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are countless tourists, including Russian-speaking ones.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257681930_e3c515a1ed_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Phuket is on the other side of the bay, it’s further to sail from there than from the mainland, so these are the boats that come from there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257385789_b6bf965f37_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is a very small island, only two rocks, one of which split open. Between them there is a small isthmus where several souvenir shops operate.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257850420_f46bdc97b1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It is often said that James Bond Island is called Ko Tapu, but this is not true. Ko Tapu is this famous rock at the entrance to the bay.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255910787_296f5b9985_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Let's go further.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255910827_88219b492c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The next point is a walk through the cave on a rowing boat. This happened in Vietnam too, only there we drove the boats ourselves, while here it is done by local guides.

<p>
The next point is an island with a cave. This time there were no tour groups other than my four-person group.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255910902_666f30385d_h.jpg"/>

<p>
There is an inaccessible lagoon inside the island.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257554214_53ee81e9d8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You could also swim here.

<p/>

Then we return to the city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255911107_2fa3a87114_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Along the way we taxied into a village on stilts.
<p/>

<p>
There are also petroglyphs on the rock near the village.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257386324_8d726c45d3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Just before we arrived, it began to rain.

<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256840733_614f526a41_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I didn't really explore much in Phang Nga town other than the night market where there was a large group in white t-shirts.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257681585_e1e21c51a3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Well, according to tradition: a pillar. Here with an elephant.
<p/>

And the street sign also has an elephant.

<h2>Phuket</h2>
<p>
I immediately liked Phuket as soon as I checked into the hotel.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257393484_14b095dc7a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
All this splendor cost 240 baht per day ($7).
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256646376_47c6fef50c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This place was not somewhere in the end of the world, but a 10-minute walk from the center of Patong (Jungceylon shopping center), however, it was necessary to walk through a wasteland, since the road made a huge detour. Patong is the most popular resort village on the island.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256847618_65ab1eaa72_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It has its own Walking street.
<p/>

There are strip clubs, but fewer than in Pattaya. In general, Patong does not look like a sex resort.

The Russian language has its place in Patong. Prices in the restaurant are high.

There are taxis on every corner in Phuket. Supply greatly exceeds demand, but the cartel keeps prices at a high level. So, a trip from Patong to the neighboring city of Karon (5 kilometers) costs 250-300 baht. It's funny that the taxi says "taxi meter", although no one here uses a meter.
<p/>

<p>
Moreover, there is also the problem of finding a motorcycle taxi, at least in Karon I didn’t find one at all, although I didn’t really want to walk 5 kilometers through the hills.

The hotel is built near a small beach and looks nice. There are surprisingly few people for such a large hotel.

Karon. There is no night entertainment here, it's a place for quiet relaxation.

The beach is not bad. There is a lot of space, the water is relatively clean.

There is still public transport in Phuket, but it is all tied to Phuket Town - the capital of the island, where tourists usually do not live, because there is no sea there. So you can still get from Patong to Karon for less than 100 baht, but it will take a lot of time.

Phuket has the largest songthaews in Thailand, they are made from trucks.

Phuket Town itself is an interesting place. There are not many places in Thailand where old architecture has been preserved.

Phuket Town was built by the Chinese, so it is quite similar to George Town in Malaysia.
