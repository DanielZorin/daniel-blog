<h1>Poland: Terespol, Warsaw, Torun, Gdansk, Gdynia, Sopot, Malbork, Elblag</h1>
<i>8-12 August 2013</i>
<h2>Terespol</h2>
<p>
For a long time Poland remained a blank spot of Europe for me. Getting there directly, either by plane or by train, although not incredibly expensive, is clearly more expensive than to Germany, which is further away, and quite comparable to Spain. Most people come to Poland in transit on their way to Western Europe by car or during a bus tour, and relatively few people travel here specifically. But the country is no worse than others in Eastern Europe, and is really underrated.
I got to Poland in the most budget-friendly way possible. First I got to Brest on a seated night train. It cost about 1,400 rubles, although if you buy a ticket directly on the Russian Railways website, it will be 800 rubles more expensive. You can save money by buying Moscow-Orsha tickets from Russian Railways and Orsha-Brest on the Belarusian Railways website, where prices are 10 times lower. Belarus recently introduced electronic registration, so I was able to travel to Brest without printing tickets. True, in Orsha I had to move to another seat in the carriage, although the train was half-empty in Belarus, and there was no need to change seats. There is an local train from Brest to Terespol for 150 rubles, and here I am in Poland.

The Brest-Terespol train is very popular among Chechen refugees. The fact is that the presence of a Schengen visa is not checked upon landing; you can go to Poland, and only after that you will be deported. The ticket is cheap, so you can live in Brest and from time to time try to travel to Poland with your whole large Caucasian family. At the Polish border control, the Chechens are trying to pity the Poles with the sad story of their lives, so that they give them temporary political asylum, having received which, 99% of the “refugees” flock to Germany.
You can get from Terespol to Warsaw for $13. Trains run rarely and are not always well matched with trains, so I had three hours to explore the town. Poland welcomes you with apartment buildings.

<p>
But in general Terespol is more of a village.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255614261_c1ff19b3ea_o.jpg">
<p>
In some places it’s purely Russian. Terespol was part of Russia until 1918 and in 1939-1945.

You can walk to the end of the town in about thirty minutes, the fields and ponds begin.

<p>
Rumors about the religiosity of Poles are confirmed. In Terespol, many huge crosses were discovered installed near the roads. Wood.

Even in such a small town there is a box for collecting old clothes. Then it goes to Russian second-hand stores.

<h2>Warsaw</h2>
<p>
I will begin my tale of the Polish capital from the end. This is what a typical residential area looks like, at an average distance from the center, almost on the “Royal Road”.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255935733_ebebd2cc81_o.jpg">
<p>
What can we say? The paths are mostly paved with tiles rather than broken asphalt or dirt. Please note that the paths are also laid diagonally so that there is no need to walk on the lawn. The main difference from similar places in Western Europe is that the grass is not cut. Five-story buildings are familiar to me; it is worth noting the fresh paint and soft colors. Garbage cans are quite typical.
<p/>

What definitely remains here from Soviet times, or more precisely from the times of the People's Republic of Poland, are the attractions on the playground.

The closest metro station to this outskirts is surrounded by trade from stalls.

<p>
I personally saw people jumping over the turnstiles in Warsaw. The metro consists of one line, the second is currently being completed, which is why several stations in the center are closed, you need to travel this section by tram.
<p/>

What else do Poland and Russia have in common? For example, Warsaw is in the top 5 cities for traffic jams (Moscow, of course, is in first place).

People in Poland also like to drink. Poles consider vodka their national drink. Lots of drinking spots.

Drinking house "Snacks-snacks" (Przekaski-zakaski). Vodka for 4 zlotys, snacks for 8. Zlotys are very convenient to convert into rubles - you need to multiply by 10.

In Poland there are so-called "milk bars". Essentially these are canteens left over from the old days. It's very cheap and there are always a lot of people there.

I left the train station in Toruń. It was raining heavily. I had a strong feeling that I was on the station square in Ivanovo, and not in Europe.

<h2>Gdansk</h2>
<p>
Gdansk is the place of the beginning of the end of communism. Lech Walesa worked here at the Lenin shipyard. A strike began at this shipyard, which led to the creation of Solidarity. A significant part of the shipyard is open to the public, which provides a unique chance to walk around the historical industrial area.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257161565_5bdb5640b1_o.jpg">
<p>
The strike movement in Poland existed before 1980. Unlike the USSR, which survived by trading hydrocarbons, in Poland communist power led the country to absolute poverty and degradation. In the 70s, that some in Russia remember with nostalgia as a time of satiety and abundance, in Poland everything was issued on ration cards. Near the entrance to the shipyard there is a monument in the shape of three crosses, dedicated to those killed during the strike in 1970. The monument was erected during the “thaw” of 1980-1981. In 1981, the Polish government imposed martial law, Solidarity was banned, and Lech Walesa was sent to prison. Communism was overthrown in Poland in 1989.

<h2>Gdynia</h2>
<p>
I arrived in Gdynia quite early, there was no one on the streets. Gdynia is a modern city, a seaport of Poland. The city began to actively develop when independent Poland was given access to the sea in 1918, but Gdansk-Danzig remained a free city, and Poland needed its own port.
