<h1>Russia: Saransk, Penza, Saratov</h1>
<i>12-13 January 2018</i>
<h2>Saransk</h2>
<p>
Saransk is the capital of Mordovia, a region in central Russia infamous for its endless prisons and endless election fraud. As it turns out, they also like big, kitschy buildings here, much like in <a href="http://goo.gl/yMjq8K">Yoshkar-Ola</a>, only more modest.
<p/>

<p>
After many decades, our descendants will study the architectural heritage of the early 21st century and give this style an official name.
<p/>

<p>
Well, for now it’s called kitsch.
<p/>

<p>
The university building was made in the form of a parody of Moscow State University. Although Mordovian State University is also MSU.
<p/>

<p>
They have more or less learned how to make temples, this area looks normal.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256215429_1cbe48c880_o.jpg">
<p>
And then they stuck absurd antique columns on top of high-tech glass.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254737187_829afdc80f_o.jpg">
<p>
The local history museum is reminiscent of <a href="http://goo.gl/SVpSfp">Romanian Parliament</a>.
<p/>

<p>
The station was painted in the brightest color they found.

<p>
But this is what Saransk was like before.
<p/>

<p>
House of Soviets.

Monument to the heroic stratonauts - they set a record for the altitude of a hot air balloon flight, but at an altitude of more than 20 kilometers the balloon froze and the stratonauts died.
<p/>

<p>
Street signs in Saransk are in four languages ​​- English has been added to Russian, Moksha and Erzya.
<p/>

<h2>Penza</h2>
<p>
Another regional center where I have never been before. This is probably one of the most inconspicuous regions - there are no sayings about Penza like “Into the wilderness, to Saratov” or “Bomb Voronezh”, and the city has not become famous for anything weird either (unlike Saransk or Yoshkar-Ola).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257670690_607f37f989_o.jpg">
<p>
The railway station here is from Soviet times, it looks stylish
<p/>

Not far from the station there is an unusual installation - a tree made from traffic lights.

<p>
The monument to Stalin is a rare sight in Russia. Probably installed here recently.

<h2>Saratov</h2>
<p>
Saratov is one of the most interesting cities in the Volga region with an extensive historical center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254738467_7c8956bfe6_o.jpg">
<p>
The building of the conservatory is very atypical for Russia; in general, I would expect to see something similar in Romania or Hungary.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254737932_710f6019ac_o.jpg">
<p>
Nearby is a church whose domes imitate St. Basil's Cathedral.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256513000_6ed2e7c96f_o.jpg">
<p>
As expected, the central street is pedestrian.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254737987_44fd73fd54_o.jpg">
<p>
Everything on it is clean and restored.

Now let's walk along the street parallel to the main pedestrian street.
<p/>

<p>
Here the facades are crumbling, the sidewalk is not cleaned at all, so it is better to move on skates.

In winter there is beauty, white ice to the horizon, and on it there are dots - people fishing in the ice hole.

Engels' coat of arms is a bull. There is a full-size statue on the track, but I didn't get a chance to take a photo.

The most interesting thing I found in Engels was this unusual Soviet monument, a monument to pioneers.

<p>
For some time I rode and walked around the areas outside the center. As is often the case in Russia, what stands out most are the shiny new shopping centers with architecture of varying degrees of kitsch.
<p/>

But many areas cannot boast of good amenities. Here, for example, is a typical sidewalk skating rink.
