<h2>Munich</h2>
<p>
Munich played a huge role in the history of the Third Reich. Adolf Hitler moved here in 1913, dodging conscription into the Austrian army, which he considered unworthy of his presence. After World War I, Hitler again settled in Munich and began his political career here. During Nazi rule, commemorative gatherings took place in the city, although the most important parade, shown in the film Triumph of the Will, took place in Nuremberg. The most important event that happened in Munich at that time was, of course, the Beer Hall Putsch. It began in the Bürgerbräukeller beer hall, which has not survived to this day, but was located somewhere between the current center of contemporary art and the Hilton Hotel.

<p>
From here, the stormtroopers, who had drunk too much beer and demanded power, headed to the city center, specifically to the War Ministry. The road went through this bridge...

<p>
...through the old gate...
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257265104_edc24b7f53_h.jpg"/>
<p>
To the main square Marienplatz.
<p/>

<p>
“The fight against the Jews will be as popular as it will be successful... I will erect as many gallows, for example, on Marienplatz in Munich, as traffic will allow. And I will hang the Jews on them one by one, one by one, and they will hang until they stink. As soon as one is removed, another will be hanged in his place - and so on until there is not a single one left in Munich. Exactly the same thing will happen in other cities until Germany is cleared of them.”
<p/>

<p>
Then the procession went north to this square.
<p/>

<p>
From here - to the right.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255790122_ef04e1ff82_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And forward towards Odeonsplatz.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256518186_389522cf8a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It all ended to the left of the Feldherrnhalle (Bavarian Army Victory Memorial), where the police started shooting at the demonstrators.
<p/>

<p>
Exactly on this very spot.
<p/>

<p>
Until 1945, there was a memorial to those killed during the Beer Hall Putsch with a guard of honor. Everyone passing by had to do a Nazi salute.
<p/>

<p>
Those who didn’t want to do it walked around the Hall of Fame from behind.
<p/>

<p>
The annual parades reached the Royal Square.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257265509_eb94ed54e9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here is another important building - the Fuhrerbau, Hitler's residence.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256518341_91fa63cad4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It was here, behind this balcony, that the Munich Agreement of 1938 was signed. Now the building houses a music school, you can’t just go inside.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257560275_744aca743a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Opposite was the Nazi Party office.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255790392_2c9c2d31cd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
What about Bürgerbräukeller? The beer hall was heavily damaged in 1939 due to an assassination attempt on Hitler organized by Georg Elser. The Fuhrer finished his traditional speech very quickly and left a few minutes before the explosion. In memory of this, there is a memorial plaque on the site of the pub, which I could not find for a long time, since I was examining the walls, but I had to look at my feet.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256719938_e5751f9a91_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The Hofbräuhaus beer hall, probably the most popular in Munich today, was also an important place in the history of the Nazi Party. The first meeting of the NSDAP took place here and its political program was adopted. And about 10 years before that, the Russian political emigrant Lenin came here.
<p/>

Now both tourists and local residents come here with families.

<p/>

Even in such a lawful country as Germany you can find violators of public order. Someone parked across the sidewalk, just like in Moscow. I wonder how long it will take for him to be fined?

Recently there was a flood, and in some places there were broken trees lying on the banks of the river.

But otherwise there is perfect order here. If a piece of the road is being repaired, the bus stop is moved a few meters further.

The white train on the left is high-speed, the red train on the right is local. On the red trains (as well as on the rarer blue ones) you can travel with the “Bavarian Ticket” for 22 euros per day as long as you like.

<p>
There are a suspiciously large number of women in black clothes walking around the city center. Moreover, they often travel by taxi, so perhaps they are even tourists from Saudi Arabia, and not just immigrants.

In general, I liked Munich and changed my opinion about Germany in general. Of the big German cities I've been to, Munich is definitely the most lively and cheerful. There is both old beauty and modern architecture (for example, in the Olympic Park), and here you can eat at 10 pm and drink beer in liter mugs.

<h2>Dachau</h2>
<p>
In Russia, despite massive propaganda every year on May 9, in general people talk very little about the Second World War. The TV picture makes it look like some kind of Hollywood superhero movie with a happy ending. At the same time, 99% hardly understand why exactly the Nazis were bad, except that they lost and were then collectively condemned. Words such as “Auschwitz” and “Dachau” are mentioned in passing in the school curriculum, solely as names and nothing more, apparently, so as not to traumatize the child’s psyche.
So, let's take a closer look at Dachau.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256242163_4335d108d4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The Nazis wanted to build an “ideal society” of superhumans with maximum Aryan spirit. Anyone who did not fit into this concept was not entitled to a place in the Reich, so almost immediately after Hitler came to power and the adoption of the law “On Eliminating the Plight of the People and the Reich,” the first concentration camp was opened in Dachau. All those who disagreed with the regime and other alien elements were supposed to be re-educated there through occupational therapy. That is why on the gates of this camp, as well as all subsequent ones, it was written “Work makes you free.”
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256790064_91c4b1f377_h.jpg"/>
<p>
With the outbreak of the World War, prisoners were especially actively used as free labor. They were fed just enough to keep working. They lived in these barracks.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255312322_09fa18b429_h.jpg"/>
<p>
These barracks are a reconstruction; only ruins remain of the original ones, their places are simply marked by piles of stones.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257085745_4414270f34_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Over time, more and more people began to be accommodated in double-decker bunks. At the peak of "total war" in 1944, the number of prisoners was in the tens of thousands, in a fairly small area.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256790034_b87b04d26f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The morning formation took place on the central alley; here the prisoners could exchange a few phrases with each other in the interval between hard labor.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257085710_544b3dfb61_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Hitler did not like Jews very much; he saw everywhere a “Jewish conspiracy” and “the machinations of global Zionism.” In principle, this is not unique, anti-Semitism has existed in Europe since ancient times, and even now in our God-saved fatherland, every second person blames the “Jewish-Masonic conspiracy” for all their troubles. But even having seized power, the crazy corporal could not give vent to his thirst for revenge without the passive support of the majority. The majority did not care about the Jews, the minority wanted to curry favor, this is how the “final solution to the Jewish question” began, and this is the most important lesson to be learned from history and not to repeat such mistakes.
Initially, the Nazis stripped Jews of their civil rights and essentially turned them into free slave labor. Later, around 1942, for some reasons that are still debated, it was decided to kill them. Practice has shown that mass executions are not the most effective way when you need to kill several million people, since the executioners quickly lose their nerve. This is how the gas chamber concept came into use. There was also one gas chamber in Dachau, although it was never used. It is necessary to separate concentration camps, where prisoners of war and dissenters were kept and forced to work, and death camps, built for the purposeful extermination of people. The death camps (Auschwitz, Majdanek, Treblinka, Sobibor, Chelmno) were located mainly in the occupied territories of Poland, in order to avoid, if possible, publicity of what was happening there among the civilian population of Germany.
For some reason, there is often a misconception that the Nazis burned people alive en masse. This is not true; cremation ovens were used to burn bodies.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256042146_de67a6fb77_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is what the entrance to the gas chamber looks like. Since there were hundreds of prisoners, and only a few guards, to avoid a riot, the guards said that everyone had to work, and first they needed to take a shower. That's why it says "shower room" above the entrance. An additional benefit for the executioners is that there is no need to remove clothes from the bodies, they are already collected in one place where they can search them and take anything valuable.

It's all about this window with bars. Behind it is a container that slides out and in from the outside.

Outside view. Capsules with poisonous gas Zyklon-B were placed in the container, which killed everyone in the room within a few minutes. The cell was cleared of bodies and disinfected by other prisoners, the Sonderkommando, who sooner or later were also sent to the cells.

<h2>Starnberg</h2>
<p>
Starnberg is a satellite city of Munich that boasts the highest average income in all of Germany. We can say that this is an elite expensive area of Munich, located on the shores of Lake Starnberg (the closest large lake to Munich).

Otherwise quite similar to other mid-sized cities in Germany (like <a href="../frankfurt">Wiesbaden</a> or <a href="../duesseldorf">Bonn</a>).

I attended some important church ceremony. A long procession of people in red cloaks walked along the street, heading to the main cathedral.

<h2>Landshut</h2>
<p>
In the city of Landshut I had an hour to change from one train to another. It was drizzling, but I decided not to wait at the station, but to walk around the city. I saw almost no useful information about this city, so I expected to see a typical German city with modest, harsh beauty, large tiles on the sidewalks, a standard train station, and one-story buildings. But everything went wrong.

I decided to skip the train and stay in Landshut. Went upstairs to the castle.

I ran for a long time from one shed to another following the processions until I got completely wet.
