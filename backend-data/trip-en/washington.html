<h1>USA: Washington DC, Alexandria, Arlington, College Park, Philadelphia, Camden</h1>
<i>21-24 September 2013</i>
<h2>Washington DC</h2>
<p>
Arriving in Washington, the capital of the American empire, I, of course, expected to receive instructions there from the insidious State Department on how to overthrow the bloody regime of Putin, break spiritual bonds and destroy Russia, as well as appropriate funding, sufficient to at least dance in church, or even leave the tomatoes on Bolotnaya Square. My disappointment knew no bounds. It turned out that the State Department was tight on money. There is not enough for a revolution in distant and unnecessary Russia, but even for a normal building. So the world’s puppeteers huddle in a gray box that looks like a Soviet research institute.

The FBI building is nicer. There is also a CIA building, it is not in Washington, but in a neighboring city, and no one is allowed within a mile of it.

Obama's motorcade. During the passage, the street leading to the White House was blocked, people stood on the sidewalk and watched (when Putin is driving somewhere, they block all passages within a kilometer radius). The cortege is very long, many, many cars, more motorcycles, and helicopters on top.

Washington is one of the "blackest" cities in the USA. Blacks have been concentrated here since the Civil War, when their champion Lincoln was based in Washington. The metropolitan area firmly holds the second-highest crime rate in the United States after Puerto Rico, although some cities in other states are more dangerous.

<p>
The capital district is not a state, it does not have representatives in Congress, so the slogan “No taxation without representation” borrowed from the leaders of the war for American independence from England, is popular here.

And then there was a tent with political activists.

In general, the city is not at all dirty and does not seem dangerous. Yes, I lived, perhaps not in the best area, in this house in the basement, but the place was quite okay. 20 minutes walk to the White House.

There are many, many monuments of varying degrees of pathos in Washington. The most recent is the monument to Martin Luther King.

The city has its own special atmosphere. I witnessed a wonderful scene in the historical museum. The large, dark room displays the original flag raised in Baltimore in 1812, to which the American anthem is dedicated. One of the museum visitors began to sing the anthem loudly and beautifully, and everyone listened attentively, and at the end they applauded. In Russia, I can’t even imagine singing the anthem in a public place, and what others would think in such a situation.

<h2>Alexandria</h2>
<p>
In any American McDonald's there is a sign stating that the notorious “loitering” is prohibited here. In New York, 30 minutes are allotted for food, and in Virginia - only 20. In reality, when the hall is empty, no one is watching with a stopwatch, but if you try to sit for a couple of hours with a laptop when all the tables in the hall are occupied, you can quickly get an invitation to the exit.
Also in the state of Virginia, McDonald's is twice as cheap as in New York and even a little cheaper than in Moscow.
<p/>

<p>
Alexandria can be reached from downtown Washington by subway. Initially, this city was part of the capital district, then the capital had the shape of a perfect square, rotated 45 degrees. The territories on the right bank of the Potomac River returned to Virginia after the outbreak of the Civil War, and remained there.

The city of Arlington has Freedom Park. Initially, there were various exhibits related to the victory over communism, in particular, a headless statue of Lenin, but now everything has been removed from there and it is an ordinary park. I asked passersby, none of them even remembered about the Lenin statue.

<h2>College Park</h2>
<p>
I really wanted to visit Maryland because it has a cool name and a great flag. The largest city in Maryland, Baltimore, is famous as one of the crime capitals of America, but I didn’t have time to go there, so I decided to just take the subway from Washington to the northeast. There is the town of College Park, where the University of Maryland is located, which, by the way, is included in the world tops in much better places than Moscow State University. It was Sunday and the campus was empty.

<h2>Camden</h2>
<p>
In recent years, Camden has held first place in the United States in terms of crime rate, ahead of such recognized masters as Detroit, Flint, St. Louis and Baltimore. When you walk across the bridge from Philadelphia, they immediately make it clear what you are getting into: “Cross the bridge at your own peril and risk.”
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256734684_ea7d5d40d8_o.jpg">

Don't vandalize the bridge, otherwise we will fine you, jail you, and then fine you again.

It should be noted that not only blacks and Mexicans live here. There is some kind of increased concentration of old hippies here, as if straight from the sixties. They live in communal blocks, ride bicycles and feel great. But mostly the houses here are smaller.

If you look, you can find abandoned houses with boarded up windows.

But in general, this place does not leave a feeling of hopelessness or the end of the world.

It's all private houses; everyone goes to supermarkets to do their shopping.

There are few people on the streets. There's someone sitting on the porch.

I was leaving on a special subway line connecting Camden and Philadelphia. The entire metro station is covered with a uniform layer of homeless people. While I was throwing coins into the ticket machine, one of them started asking me for money, then the second one came up, they started talking in a raised voice and almost got into a fight, but I didn’t give anything to anyone and left.
