<h1>Bulgaria: Sofia, Plovdiv, Pleven, Ruse</h1>
<i>6-7 July 2014</i>
<h2>Sofia</h2>
<p>
In the USSR, there was a saying: "Chicken is not a bird, and Bulgaria is not a foreign country". It is also known that the Bulgarians are our brothers, almost like the Serbs (however, for some reason in both world wars they were allies of the Germans). Having visited Bulgaria, I can say that these two stereotypes definitely appeared for a reason.

I arrived in Sofia from Macedonia at 4 am. There was nothing special to do, at the bus station I bought chocolates at the only working stall, and sat on the benches for about forty minutes. The first bus to Plovdiv left at 7 am, so when dawn began, I went for a walk around the city. Suddenly a tram came towards me.

Hmm, it’s not bad that the transport runs at five in the morning. From the passage you can look at the metro trains.

The center of Sofia is built up with government buildings in the Stalinist Empire style.
<p/>

<p>
There is also a high-rise building with a spire, like in <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/281147.html">Warsaw</a>.

The installation of benches is sponsored by the bank, as in <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/259045.html">Kaluga</a>.

Alexander II and the Russian army that defeated Turkey in the war of 1877-1878 thereby restoring the independence of Bulgaria are highly revered here. It is interesting that in Bulgaria, as in Serbia, part of the population converted to Islam during the Ottoman rule, and they live quite compactly in two regions - in the south and in the northeast.
<p/>

It turns out that they also listen to Philip Kirkorov here.

Bulgaria is the only country, besides Russia, where stores are closed for “counting”.

Bulgarian spelling looks unusual for a Russian speaker.

A well-known traffic police post, towering above the road. You can see this in <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/247024.html">Transnistria</a> too.

What Soviet city would be without a monument in honor of the Victory? Here it is called the “Liberator Army”.
<p/>

Nearby there is a children's playground with concrete monsters.

When I got on the subway, I realized why the transport started running so early. There is a 1 hour time difference between Bulgaria and Macedonia, and I forgot to change the clock.

The Sofia metro is one of the leaders in terms of complexity, although it can be said to have only one line twisted into a loop: two lines intersect in the center and meet on one of the outskirts. I haven’t traveled to this outskirts, but it looks like you can travel along both lines without leaving the carriage even once. This conclusion can be drawn from the signs above the driver’s cab. When you enter the metro, after the turnstiles there are no signs indicating which direction which train is going, you need to go down to the platform. When trains go through the center at a station, you may not be able to guess. The direction is also shown strangely; at the central station the direction sign says “Lozenets”, although I didn’t find a station with that name on the diagram. The most reliable way to navigate is by the light display inside the car. It’s interesting that inspectors sometimes walk around the carriages, although there are turnstiles everywhere at the entrance.

On the outskirts of the metro it runs almost on the surface under a dome like this.

Outskirts of Sofia. By the way, in Bulgarian the name of the capital is pronounced with the emphasis on the first syllable, I even thought that I had been pronouncing it incorrectly all my life, but in Russian it is still correct to say SofIya.
<p/>

<p>
There is a museum of socialist art here, where samples of Soviet monuments were brought. As a collector of Lenin monuments, I cannot miss this.
<p/>

I counted five monuments to Lenin.

In general, Sofia is a couple of thousand years old, but instead of a large-scale field with excavations, as, for example, in the Roman Forum, here small fragments of excavations are found under ordinary houses.

I arrive in the city of Plovdiv. There are ruins on the right.

In fact, Plovdiv is a very ancient city, and in addition to the central street in the style of the late 19th century, there are even buildings from the Roman Empire.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257397044_7797bd142b_o.jpg">
<p>
A theater, for example.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257693555_bbf156bcd7_o.jpg">
<p>
The Roman buildings are located much lower than the modern sidewalk level. Above is a mosque from the Ottoman Empire.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257556134_cb4b77cdda_o.jpg">
<p>
The main distinctive feature of Plovdiv is that the streets in the old town on the hill are paved with cobblestones. I have never seen such a large cobblestone in a pavement before. To be honest, walking is not very comfortable; you can fall over at any time.
<p/>

The Bulgarian language never ceases to amaze. Rock and roll in Bulgarian literally sounds like “rokendrol”.

It is interesting that a sound similar to the short “o”, denoted by the letter Ъ, is conveyed in transliteration by the letter A.

<h2>Pleven</h2>
<p>
No country in Europe is as similar to Russia as Bulgaria. Sometimes everything is repeated down to the smallest detail.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257396549_7ddb1e2e00_o.jpg">
<p>
The city of Pleven is famous mainly for the battle that took place here during the Bulgarian War of Independence of 1877-1878. In honor of this, there is an analogue of our “Borodino Panorama”, as well as many monuments to Russian generals.

Bus stations in Bulgaria look similar to those in <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/249684.html">Brazil</a>. Instead of one cash register, there are many windows of different companies with colorful signs. Companies travel to different destinations, so you first need to figure out which window to approach.

<p>
The Danube also flows here, on the other side of which is Romania. Here you can cross the border through the bridge, to which a city bus runs from the Bulgarian side, and on the Romanian side you can walk in about 40 minutes. Interestingly, the control is only on one side of the bridge, if you are going to Romania - on the Romanian side, if to Bulgaria - on Bulgarian. Passports must have both stamps. The Romanian one was barely visible, and the Bulgarian one seemed to have been placed not only barely visible, but also on top of five other stamps.
