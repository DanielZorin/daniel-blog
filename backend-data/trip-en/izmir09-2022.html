<h1>Turkey: Izmir, Çeşme, Bergama, Marmaris</h1>
<i>6-13 September 2022</i>
<h2>Izmir</h2>
<p>
I was in Izmir <a href="../izmir">in January</a> for quite a short time, but I saw all the main attractions. This time I spent almost a week there, went to neighboring cities, and covered some blind spots from the last trip.
<p/>

<p>
The main thing is that I reached the top of the hill with the fortress. The climb up there is quite long.
<p/>

In fact, you can get here by car and even by bus there is a route almost to the very entrance.

<p>
In fact, only one full wall remains of the castle; on the other side there are no walls, or only the foundation, all sorts of garbage dumps and just residential buildings.

Every year, on September 9th there's a celebration of the liberation of Izmir from Greece during the War of Independence in 1922. At the same time there is a fair.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52418430467_611511484e_o.jpg">
<p>
In 2022, accordingly, there was an anniversary - exactly 100 years, so the celebration was very large-scale.
<p/>

<p>
It was completely impossible to get closer to the stage; the entire center was filled.

<h2>Çeşme</h2>
<p>
Çeşme is a city an hour's drive from Izmir on the Aegean Sea. It was interesting to me as the departure point for ferries to Greece, but it is also quite a tourist town in itself, where people come to swim on the surrounding beaches.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52418444467_b7f60f7b26_o.jpg">

<p>
I arrived early in the morning to catch the ferry, so I didn’t walk around the city for a long time.

<h2>Bergama</h2>
<p>
The city of Bergama contains the ruins of the ancient city of Pergamon, listed as a World Heritage Site. I want to try to visit all such places in Turkey, so I went there too, since it’s not very far from Izmir.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52419237584_6fdacea5c8_o.jpg">

<p>
It took me a long time to get there - first by train to the final station of Aliaga, and from there by bus (pay with an Izmir travel card). I thought about going back the same way, but I found a minibus standing straight to Izmir and took it. But I didn’t find out where it was leaving from in Izmir, since I got out when it was passing by one of the metro stations. Intercity buses to the north pass through Bergama, but stop only at the bus station, from which it is still 20 kilometers to the city, inconveniently.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52419238529_e868bdabf6_o.jpg">
<p>
The main attraction is clearly visible from a distance - this is the Acropolis on a high hill in the north of the city.

<h2>Marmaris</h2>
<p>
From Izmir I went home by bus. So as not to have to travel all day, I split the trip into two parts and stopped for a day in the city of Marmaris. This is one of the most popular resorts in Turkey for residents of England and other European countries; There are Russians too, of course, but not as many as in the vicinity of Antalya, and the signs in shops and travel agencies here are mostly in English. Marmaris belongs to the province of Muğla (as does <a href="../fethiye">Fethiye</a>).
<p/>

<p>
There are a lot of small hotels in the central part of Marmaris, but there seem to be no large ones here.

Along the coast there are a huge number of rather kitschy ships. There are similar ships in Kemer, but much fewer. They take you on daytime excursions around the area and diving.

In general, prices in the center of Marmaris are very high. In these cafes on the embankment, I actually saw Adana Kebab costing 250 liras ($14)! The normal price is about 60 liras, and I have never seen anything more expensive than 150, even in Kemer and Antalya. Apparently, they decided to set prices here that are familiar to residents of Western Europe.
