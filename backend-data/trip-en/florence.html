<h1>Italy: Ancona, Assisi, Perugia, Pisa, Florence, Venice</h1>
<i>29 June - 1 July 2023</i>
<h2>Ancona</h2>
<p>
Ancona is the capital of the Italian region of Marche. This is a port on the Adriatic coast. Probably one of the least touristy cities I've visited in Italy.
<p/>

<p>
The station is quite far from the center, at least two kilometers away.

<p>
The shortest route is past the port along the sea. At the entrance to the port there is an old star-shaped island fortress that was once a quarantine site.

<p>
The terrain is complex, the city center is on the hills, you can’t walk straight through everywhere.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53037289232_8378d1ea5d_o.jpg">
<p>
All these routes are needed for the cargo port. In the distance you can see the Ancona Cathedral on a hill.

<p>
I wanted to have lunch, but since Ancona is a non-tourist city, absolutely all restaurants work according to the Italian schedule, that is, lunch until about two, dinner from eight, and in between they are closed. Fiasco.

Ancona has an interesting numbering of routes - there are integers, fractions, letters, and fractions with letters.

<h2>Assisi</h2>
<p>
Assisi is a small city included in the World Heritage List as the birthplace of the Franciscan friars.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53038352928_ec99efd127_o.jpg">

<p>
Assisi is located in the Umbria region, most of which is occupied by the Apennines.

The station is located in the town of Santa Maria degli Angeli, and Assisi itself is a couple of kilometers away on a hill. Santa Maria has a lot of inns combined with restaurants, just like in the good old days. I stopped in one of these.

For dinner (since I couldn’t have a proper lunch in Ancona) I tried Strangozzi pasta, this is pasta from the Umbria region.

The most important place is the chapel inside the cathedral - the Porziuncola. Francis of Assisi himself, the founder of the Franciscan order - the most famous mendicant order - prayed there.

<h2>Perugia</h2>
<p>
Perugia is the capital of the Umbria region. The city is located on top of a hill, so there are many picturesque views.
<p/>

<p>
The station is located at the bottom, to get to the center you need to climb to the very top of the hill. Minimetro will help us with this.

These are the kind of cars that automatically, without a driver, go up the hill using cable traction.

<h2>Pisa</h2>
<p>
Until recently, the Leaning Tower of Pisa was apparently the most popular attraction I hadn't seen. Now, probably, this title goes to Machu Picchu.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53037872406_3dd60d1aee_o.jpg">

<p>
The Leaning Tower of Pisa is the bell tower of the cathedral. In the encyclopedia that I read as a child, it was written that it slopes every year by several millimeters, but this information is outdated - in 2008 it was stabilized.
<p/>

<p>
Even if it weren't slanted, it would still be quite unique in terms of architecture.

It’s cool that there are always a bunch of people taking pictures around the tower, as if supporting it.

In principle, it’s similar in Venice, but it’s not so noticeable there, because Venice itself is unusual, there are all sorts of canals. And here it is just an ordinary Italian city, only empty.

<h2>Florence</h2>
<p>
Florence is the capital of the Tuscany region, one of the most popular cities in Italy. I was here a long time ago, in 2009.

It’s better to come here in winter; in summer there are really too many people. To even enter the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, you have to stand in line for about 30 minutes.
<p/>

<h2>Venice</h2>
<p>
I was flying early in the morning from Venice airport. Since I was in Venice <a href="http://goo.gl/dXWECn">on my last trip</a>, I planned to spend the night in a hostel, but of course I couldn’t help but walk a little around the center of such an epic city .

Venice is very expensive in the summer. A place in a hostel cost 30 euros, and this was not in Venice itself (on the island), but in Mestre (on the mainland). I have never been to Mestre before.
