<h1>USA: Los Angeles, San Diego</h1>

<h2>Los Angeles</h2>
<p>

I asked the big guy in the yard,
Who drank beer in the morning in dirty sweatpants:
“Tell me, who wants you to live like this?”
"The United States of America!"
</i>
Los Angeles is a city from which you expect the worst. Endless square streets of the same type, zero pedestrians and traffic jams - this is roughly the picture that emerges from the guidebook. With this attitude, I really liked LA. It turned out that this is a completely civilized city, no worse than, say, <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/296718.html">Shenzhen</a>.

<p>
The flight from Moscow to Los Angeles was not the longest for me: Dubai - Rio de Janeiro was two hours longer. We were lucky with the weather: it was cloudless, everything was clearly visible. This is Mono Lake, with Yosemite National Park in the foreground. Of course, most tourists in California go there and don't stay in Los Angeles.

The fields are lined with typical American squares.

And here is the city.

<p>
Like most large American cities, Los Angeles is a group of skyscrapers in the downtown area and endless one-story buildings around.
<p/>

Los Angeles is famous for its highway interchanges. They look very impressive from the air.

From the ground it’s also nice.

Contrary to popular belief, Los Angeles has functional public transportation. Several metro lines and many buses. At the same time, Los Angeles transport is devoid of the main drawback that causes people in Moscow to switch to cars: there are no crowds and crush. Traveling by metro and bus is much cheaper than renting a car, so it is very suitable for tourists. If you have your own car, then the difference in price is not that big: gasoline in the USA costs around $1 per liter, 1 liter is enough travel 15-20 kilometers, one trip on the subway costs $1.75, and a monthly pass costs $100, i.e. for commuting to work within 30 kilometers from home, the car is no more expensive, provided there is free parking. Apparently, that’s why I was the only white passenger on the subway and buses.
<p/>

<p>
All major Los Angeles attractions are easily accessible by public transportation. It’s also not difficult to understand the system; there are diagrams everywhere. The most convenient for tourists is a day pass for $7.

What can you see in L.A.? Paradoxically, there is also an “old town” here. It consists of three houses and one street.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256583948_81d62e4a21_o.jpg">
<p>
California was once part of Mexico, but at that time the population there was very small; today's large cities were small monasteries. In the "old town" Mexicans sell Mexican souvenirs.
<p/>

I lived two metro stops from the center, there was already a Mexican quarter there.

First street. A typical old American building, similar ones can be found on the east coast.

Next to the “old city” there is traditionally a Chinatown, with a traditional arch at the entrance.

There is an excellent free observation deck in the city center. It is located on the top floor of City Hall. Traditionally in America, the city hall is open to visitors; you need to have your passport with you and go through the frame. From above you can look at the road junctions.

Los Angeles is, first and foremost, a place where movies are made. If after my trip to New York I began to recognize half of the background scenery, now I’ll probably recognize the other half.

I'm not a good movie connoisseur; I've never heard 90% of the names on the Avenue of Stars.

Each star has a clue about their field of activity: cinema, television, music. The Simpsons are from television.

The center of life in Los Angeles if Hollywood, not downtown. At least you can meet passers-by here in the evening. For example, three spider-men and Chewbacca.
<p/>

If you're lucky, you can meet real actors. On the right is Jessica Chastain, star of the film Interstellar.

If you don't hunt for stars in the back streets of Beverly Hills, where they drive home in cars with tinted windows, then the easiest way to find them is near the theater where the Oscars are being presented.

The second thing Los Angeles is famous for is its beaches. It takes about 40 minutes to get to them from the city center.
<p/>

It was hot, and I had a time difference of -11 hours, so I was exhausted on the beach and slept for a while.

This beach is formally located in the city neighboring Los Angeles - Santa Monica. It has its own "city center".

In the flower bed with the plant, they hung a whole wall of text with rules of behavior, as well as a warning that there might be dangerous chemicals somewhere nearby.

Public offer laws in the USA work somehow differently than in Russia. Here the store may refuse to serve the client without explanation.

This place is called Venice for a reason. Canals were laid here. Venice is truly American - the canals also run in a square grid.

On the outskirts of San Diego is the border with Mexico. You can get there by tram, and then walk along the corridor. There are no controls at the exit from the USA, except for police with dogs. That's where I headed.
