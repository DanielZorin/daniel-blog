<h2>Moscow</h2>
<p>
In the summer of 2019, I mainly drove a car around the Losinoostrovsky, Babushkinsky, Sviblovo and Otradnoye districts for the purpose of learning to drive. Now I know my way around the streets of these areas quite well, although I may have never been on the metro in Otradnoye.

I took part in the challenge to walk along the metro line, although it was a bit of a cheat - I only walked along the shortest, yellow line. This is about 25 kilometers, while all full-fledged lines (intersecting twice with the ring) are 30-50 kilometers long. Start in the familiar Novokosino.

The winter of 2019 was short for me, since on January 10 a trip to Oceania, the USA and East Asia began. But I still managed to catch both the snow and the city’s New Year’s decorations.

It’s interesting that in all of Moscow there are only 6 or 7 places where you can take exams for a driver’s license, and two of them are quite close in the Northern okrug in very inconvenient locations. Apparently, there is the highest demand for driver's licenses, since this is the largest piece of Moscow without a metro. Near Pyalovskaya Street, where I took the exam, the Seligerskaya metro station recently appeared. And international licenses are issued in even fewer places; I had to go to Lobnenskaya (Dmitrovsky district, near the Moscow Ring Road).

On March 16, 2020, I flew to Moscow from Thailand. The rules did not require "self-isolation", but just in case, I almost didn’t go out anywhere, especially since the weather was cold. At the very end of March, I managed to go get a new bank card and some other business, and a couple of days later general "self-isolation" (this is what the lockdown was called in Russian, implying that people isolate themselves on their own will) with passes began. In April 2020, I went outside my area only once. According to the pedometer, only 32,000 steps were accumulated in a month (usually 10-12 times more).

At the beginning of June, a "regime of scheduled walks" was introduced, but by this time no one cared; people walked en masse on the streets within the district. In the Moscow region, lockdown was canceled earlier than in Moscow, and on one of the last days of official self-isolation, I visited Mytishchi.
