<h1>Hungary: Budapest, Zalaegerszeg, Lenti</h1>
<i>18-19 June 2014</i>
<h2>Budapest</h2>
<p>
For the third time I was in the glorious city of Budapest. I didn’t plan to stay there for a long time, so it was limited to a walk around Buda and a visit to one interesting outskirts of the city, where there was even a sign about the entrance to Budapest.

<p>
The walk was in well-known places in the center.

Unlike <a href="../szeged">last time</a>, this time I was on Buda side.

I like Budapest more every time.

It seems that Gurbanguly Myalikgulyevich Berdimuhammedov came to Hungary on a visit, and flags of Turkmenistan hung on the Széchenyi Bridge.

On the outskirts of Budapest there is a sculpture park (szomborpark), which in English is called "Memento Park"
<p/>

Monuments from the times of socialism are collected here.

<p>
I think these are far from all the monuments that have ever existed here. Although in Hungary they did not erect a monument to Lenin in every city, as in Russia, many were certainly destroyed. So my idea to make a park somewhere with a whole forest of Lenin monuments has not yet even come close to being realized.

In the middle is Bela Kun, the head of the Hungarian communists of the 20s. Interestingly, after the establishment of the Horthy dictatorship, he fled to the USSR, where he was executed in 1937.

There are only two monuments to Lenin here.

Although, maybe these are also Lenin’s legs?

The inscription is in Russian, once there were such in all Warsaw Treaty countries.

Well, my personal favorite is this monument.

<h2>Hitchhiking</h2>
<p>
The task was the following: to get from Budapest to Maribor (Slovenia). The distance between these cities is about 300 kilometers. A train runs once a day and covers this monstrous distance in just 6 (!) hours. You can find out the price at the station, it is also monstrous: more than 50 euros. There are also buses several times a week, but they go all the way through Croatia. As a result, the decision was abruptly made to hitchhike. Neither Alena nor I had experience hitchhiking in Europe, so we made all possible mistakes.
Hitchhiking in Europe is very different from hitchhiking in Russia. Firstly, while in Russia you can compare hitchhiking with public transport in terms of travel efficiency, in Europe it makes no sense. Hitchhiking is free, but very, very long and tiring. Since in Europe the distances between interesting cities are much shorter than in Russia, it is actually easier to pay 10 euros for a train (if you travel within one country, the transport runs frequently) than to spend half a day traveling 200 kilometers. If you don’t combine it with free accommodation, then the financial benefit disappears: since whole days will be spent moving, you will have to spend a day more overnight in each city. So hitchhiking is suitable either in case of extreme lack of money (and unlimited time), or in extreme situations such as a trip from Hungary to Slovenia.

<p>
Secondly, in Europe you cannot hitchhike the way you do in Russia - on the highways. Actually, we went out onto the road near the sculpture park on the outskirts of Budapest, after 15-20 minutes we caught a car to the city of Erd, about 20 kilometers away, from there we were almost immediately given a lift to the exit to the highway, and that’s all. There was no way to go further, since pedestrians are prohibited from being on the highway, and even if you go out there, no one will stop anyway. We caught a car in the opposite direction and returned to Budapest, ending up somewhere at the beginning of the motorway. There were several gas stations where there were still many hitchhikers with signs. At the exit from the gas station, we quite easily caught a car for as much as 100 kilometers (a third of the way), but here we made the most fatal mistake: instead of getting off at the gas station, we got off at the turn into a city familiar to me (<a href="../szeged">Siofok</a>), where the driver was going. No one stopped at the exit to the highway, although this does not seem to be prohibited, and there were no gas stations on the highway, probably for the next five kilometers in either direction. After several hours of misadventures, passing police officers gave us a lift to the town of Zamardi, 10 kilometers from Siófok.

It was already 8 o’clock in the evening, and we decided to look at Lake Balaton and go back to Budapest on the last train, since a bed in the hostel cost less than 4 (!) euros.

The next day I came up with the following cunning plan: take a bus as close as possible to the border of Hungary and Slovenia, hitchhike across the border on local roads (not highways), and then as luck would have it. In extreme cases there is already some kind of public transport inside Slovenia . In the worst case scenario, the Budapest-Maribor train passes through Zalaegerszeg; there was hope that the ticket from Zalaegerszeg would be cheaper. The task was complicated by the fact that on the second day a hotel was booked in Piran, which is not 300, but 600 kilometers from Budapest. The city closest to the Slovenian border has the unpronounceable name Zalaegerszeg.

The city looks rather dull, but still makes a much better impression than <a href="../hungary2">Esztergom</a>.

From Zalaegerszeg we hitchhiked to the town of Bak, where two roads intersect. There is such an unusual building in Bak.

<p>
Even in these villages there are hotels, or rather guesthouses. Apparently, they are aimed at the Germans and Austrians.

And this is a better bus stop in the village of Nova, 20 kilometers from Baka.

From here we reached Lenti, the last town before the Slovenian border. Compared to Bak and Nova, Lenti is simply a metropolis.

<p>
Somewhere here, cars with Slovenian license plates began to appear, so I became convinced that the country of Slovenia actually exists (Slovenia is so difficult to get to that I was already beginning to suspect that its existence was a global hoax). Finally, a nice girl drove us to a village on the other side of the border, and I saw Slovenia.

<p>
In general, if you are not trying to stand on the motorway, hitchhiking in Hungary more or less works, although not very quickly. In the process of communicating with the nicest drivers, I practiced speaking a little bad German, since many older and middle-aged people here studied this language at school, and not English.
