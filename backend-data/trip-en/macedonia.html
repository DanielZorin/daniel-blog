<h1>Macedonia: Skopje, Ohrid, Bitola</h1>
<i>4-5 July 2014</i>
<h2>Skopje</h2>
<p>
Macedonia is a country that appeared completely by accident. It so happened that this territory ended up in Yugoslavia, and after the collapse it became independent. Bulgarians believe that Macedonia should become part of Bulgaria because the Macedonian language is a dialect of Bulgarian (since the Macedonians lived in the same country with the Serbs, it has Serbian influence). The Greeks are unhappy that Macedonia is called Macedonia, because modern Macedonia has nothing to do with the state of Macedonia, where Alexander the Great lived. Albanians believe that half of Macedonia should be included in Greater Albania, because Albanians also live there. Macedonians do not care in the slightest. Well, yes, the Macedonians are a young nation, but so what? True, attempts to rewrite history in order to take your ancestry back thousands of years look quite funny. Here, for example, is the monument to Alexander the Great, which, in order not to anger the Greeks, is officially called “Warrior on Horseback.” The monuments to Tamerlane in <a href="../uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a> look approximately the same.

<p>
There are so many monuments around the Warrior on horseback that I started looking for angles to capture as many as possible in one frame.

<p>
Here they erect monuments to entire crowds of people.

The record number is probably on the bridge, where all the founding fathers for two thousand years stand.
<p/>

<p>
There are also many smaller sculptures.

<p>
The Arc de Triomphe looks funny.

The historical center is purely Turkish.

<p>
There are no people at all. During the day, the entire city center was cordoned off by the police, because the Albanians were rioting there, and apparently the people did not dare to go there in the evening. It was quite lively on the other side of the river.

<p>
The gigantomania of the Macedonians was also manifested in the fact that several years ago they erected the largest cross in the world on a mountain above Skopje. It's called "Millennium Cross". It looks scary to me.

The city from there can be seen somewhere in the distance under the cable car.

<p>
But there is a good view of the surrounding hills.

While I was waiting for the bus back to the city, I photographed the kittens near the destroyed shack. Two kittens hid in a drainpipe, so that one of them only slightly peeked out.

<p>
Buses in Skopje suddenly look like London red double-deckers.

<p>
The letters on license plates are duplicated in Cyrillic.
<p/>

<p>
Cyrillic is used here with unusual fonts, as in <a href="../serbia">Serbia</a>.

Victor Hugo's surname is transliterated here as "Igo".

<p>
The houses are covered with paint that looks blue in daylight, but if you direct artificial light (for example, a camera flash), the background will turn light blue.

<h2>Ohrid</h2>
<p>
Let's go to the center. Not to the left, but to the right.
<p/>

<p>
Asphalt is like that.

<p>
Everything is fine in the center. Ohrid is the most touristic and ancient city in Macedonia.
<p/>

<p>
There are many tourists from Albania and Turkey.

<p>
People come here to swim in the lake of the same name.
<p/>

<p>
Here, like in Croatia, there are red roofs, not gray apartment buildings.
<p/>

<p>
There is even something from the Romans.
<p/>

<p>
The city is actually quite big.

<p>
Courtyard. Somewhere here I found a mulberry bush, the only time in the Balkans.

Yellow and red fence.

Full house.

Don't hang posters.

<p>
There is also some kind of increased concentration of retro cars in Ohrid. I don’t know what kind of brands these are, apparently some kind of Yugoslavian ones.

<h2>Bitola</h2>
<p>
First of all, I decided to buy a ticket for the night bus to Sofia at the bus station. I didn’t have much cash, and they didn’t accept credit cards at the bus station. Moreover, there was no exchange office or ATM there. There was nothing there at all. Opposite the bus station is the train station, but everything is even worse there. There was nothing to do, I went to look for an exchanger.
<p/>

<p>
Bitola was not impressive.
<p/>

<p>
Looks Soviet.
<p/>

<p>
I looked for an exchange bureau for a long time, walking around almost the entire center, similar to the center of Skopje. After changing the money, I went back to the station, fortunately there was still more than two hours before the bus. On the way back I wandered onto Gavrilo Princip Street.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256132278_80d3bb180e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And then it turned out that there would be no bus to Sofia. There was a schedule on the wall according to which it should depart every day, and I also saw it on the website, but it wasn’t on the electronic board! I decided to go to Skopje, and bought a ticket for the last bus, which left in about 20 minutes. I devoted the remaining time to photographing the garbage dumps around the station.

<p>
Fortunately, I was lucky and there were several buses going through Skopje to Sofia, I caught the bus around 11 pm. The bus was also two-thirds empty, so I was able to sleep well.
