<h1>Mozambique: Maputo</h1>
<i>10-11 February 2024</i>
<h2>Maputo</h2>
<p>
In general, I don’t like going to a new country for a couple of days just to see the capital. But in Mozambique, I decided to break this principle, since I did not have the strength and confidence to travel around this very large country, the distances there are very long, the roads are of poor quality, and internal flights are not cheap. But I really wanted to visit an unusual Lusophone country, and it recently became visa free, so just a $60 plane ticket from South Africa, a $10 borderd fee, and here I am in Maputo.

There was a civil war in Mozambique for a long time, which set the country back a lot. Just 10 years ago, only adventure seekers who liked to visit all sorts of unusual African countries came here. But it seems that recently the situation has begun to improve, and even the visa regime has been simplified. And now in Maputo there is already a good selection of hotels at normal prices; for 20 dollars I rented a decent room in the very center. As usual, the historical center is also a market area.

Shoes are laid out here as if for a parade.

<p>
I bought a SIM card with internet from the boys for $2. In addition to SIM cards, they also sell other useful things, namely cigarettes and alcohol.

There are some exotic fruits here, like the sugar apple. I bought grapes for 100 meticals ($1.5).
<p/>

This is what meticals look like, the bills are new.

<p>
On another street they were selling T-shirts, and then I saw a 7-11 T-shirt that I wanted to buy last year in Thailand on Khao San Road, but it wasn’t there. And here it is, and for only 100 meticals.

<p>
There is also a base for local buses and minibuses in the center, but long-distance ones run from the bus station on the outskirts. I took the taxi through the Yango app (the same as Yandex.taxi). Taxi in Mozambique is the cheapest of all the countries on this trip - a trip around Maputo costs no more than 2-3 dollars (even to the airport).

The best restored railway station. Trains used to run from here all the way to Johannesburg. Now on the South African side, trains don’t seem to be running, but there is a train from Maputo to the border.

At the station I first met Portuguese tiles. Missed you, darling!

In general, mosques are found quite often, here is a large one near the center.

Islam seems to be on the rise here, although initially it was more of a Catholic country.

The post office building was also restored, including the tiles in front of the entrance. I think Maputo will gradually become more beautiful.

Behind the old town in Maputo there is a large hill with straight streets lined with rows of trees.

On the one hand, it doesn't look very fashionable. But compared to other African cities, where beyond the market there are continuous one-story buildings with fences, it looks unusual. A real city, even with high-rise buildings.

Those who are nostalgic for Moscow can go to Maputo - in some places you can’t tell the difference. And Yandex.taxi works.
<p/>

<p>
It was originally built for the governor, but he did not move there. It is believed that this is due to the fact that the iron heats up too much, but it is not certain. Since then there have been all sorts of government institutions.

In Maputo I found many restaurants and cafes, something I did not see in countries like Zimbabwe and Zambia. There are probably reputable restaurants there too, but somewhere on the outskirts, where you have to go by car. And in Maputo, like in Europe, you can walk.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537434105_04269294ef_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In general, Maputo feels safe; there are no electric fences, which are common in South Africa. In the evening, until late, someone was having fun and singing songs under my windows.

To get acquainted with the local cuisine, I took two dishes from the Prato Nacional section: chicken with peanuts, and mboa with crab and shrimp. Each cost 500 meticals - $8.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537434000_47aa2b07f9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The food is just 10 out of 10, especially the crab. I have never eaten such a huge crab before; it seems they are sold in Kamchatka, but they cost 100 dollars, not 8.

I never thought that of all the countries on this trip, I would most want to return to Mozambique. I hope that normal roads will be built there, and it will be possible to drive all the way to Tanzania through Tofu, Beira, Quelimane, the Bazaruto archipelago and the island of Mozambique (after which the country is named). In the meantime, I got into a cramped minibus and rode 80 km to the border with Eswatini for 200 meticals. The road was quite rough in places.
