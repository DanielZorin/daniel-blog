<h1>Turkey: Antalya</h1>

<h2>Antalya</h2>
<p>
There were still a couple of interesting places in Antalya that I hadn't been to, since you can only get there by car. One day I had a car, and I needed to go to Antalya, which I took advantage of. The first place is the ruins of the ancient city of Termessos.
<p/>

<p>
Termessos is located on the northwestern outskirts of Antalya, on the road to Korkuteli. From the main road, along which minibuses run, you need to go up the serpentine for another 10 kilometers.

<p>
Antalya is somewhere far below.

<p>
Then from the parking lot there is another rather long climb on foot.

<p>
And finally, the ruins of the ancient city on the hill!

<p>
There are very few visitors, which is not surprising, given how difficult it is to get here. Group tours usually don't go to Termessos.
<p/>

<p>
There are a lot of ruins and piles of stones, despite the remoteness of the place.

<p>
This is a remote area of ​​Antalya, Döşemealtı. Theoretically, you can get here by bus, and it's a 45-minute walk from the bus stop.

I spent the last night in Antalya before the flight. I had already been to this hotel in winter on the day of the Nogu Svelo! concert. This is the cheapest hotel in Konyaalti, it cost more than $40. The air conditioning worked poorly.
