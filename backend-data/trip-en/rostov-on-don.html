<h1>Russia: Krasnodar, Rostov-on-Don, Azov, Taganrog, Starocherkassk</h1>
<i>21-25 September 2018</i>
<h2>Krasnodar</h2>
<p>
I explored Krasnodar quite thoroughly: for half the day I rode local cramped, wretched minibuses throughout the city from end to end, and only then looked at the historical center. As usual, I took the very numerous monuments to Lenin here as a basis, but along the way I saw many other interesting things.

The Agricultural University was not far from my hotel. Students are greeted with the slogan “Achievements of science for agriculture!”

On message boards, in addition to the standard announcements about hair and help for drug addicts, there are a lot of offers to go to the seaside, fortunately it’s not very far away.

In Krasnodar there are many construction sites and new huge residential complexes everywhere, between which there are still low-rise blocks.
<p/>

<p>
Low-rise buildings are gradually falling into disrepair, and the city is growing upward.

Krasnodar is one of the fastest growing cities in Russia in terms of population, apparently due to its warm climate.

FC Krasnodar Stadium is one of the most modern and beautiful stadiums in Russia. It's surprising that it wasn't used during the World Cup.

There is such a strange region in Russia, Adygea, surrounded on all sides by the Krasnodar Krai. Part of Adygea is located high in the Caucasus mountains, and part is on the plain near Krasnodar. Adygs in the republic make up about 25% of the population; one might assume that they are concentrated in the mountains, but everything is exactly the opposite - almost all Adygs live in the northern part near Krasnodar or in the capital Maykop. Adygea begins exactly on the other side of the Kuban River opposite Krasnodar.

Mostly Krasnodar residents go to Adygea to the IKEA store, but I stopped by the first village after the border called Yablonovsky - the second largest settlement in Adygea.

<h2>Rostov-on-Don</h2>
<p>
I’ve been wishing to visit Rostov-on-Don for a very long time, but I kept putting it off because traveling by train was a little too far, and flying by plane was a little expensive.

If you go down the elevator in the bridge pylon and walk a little along the river, you can visit the Paramonov warehouses - a very strange place. In general, this is a monument to industrial architecture of the 19th century, but it is so unprotected that people stupidly store rubbish there, and the walls are destroyed.

<h2>Azov</h2>
<p>
Near Rostov-on-Don there are three cities from among the list of historical cities of Russia. I went first to the closest one - Azov. This is a seaport for which there was a struggle for a long time between Russia and Turkey; it was destroyed several times during wars.
<p/>

<p>
The city is small, and the historical part is quite modest: one beautiful square, a couple of blocks around, and a fortress.

That summer, Taganrog was experiencing an invasion of mosquitoes. There were so many of them that many walls and signs turned into peculiar mosquito hives.

<h2>Starocherkassk</h2>
<p>
Stanitsa Starocherkasskaya is a small village near Rostov, once the capital of the Don Cossacks. Nowadays, Cossacks are costumed clowns and bandits, but once upon a time they explored the desert steppes of southern Russia, conquered the Caucasus and explored Siberia and the Far East. You can get to Starocherkasskaya by bus from Rostov, just once an hour.
