<h1>Russia: St. Petersburg</h1>
<i>May 2003</i>
<p>
I went to St. Petersburg for the third time, again it was a prize for winning a school Olympiad, but this time the trip was short - only three days. This was shortly before the celebration of the city's 300th anniversary. We lived in the White Nights hotel in a poor, remote area of ​​​​Vesely Poselok behind the Neva (the nearest metro station is Lomonosovskaya).
