<h2>Mexico City</h2>
<p>
With my <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/314347.html">love</a> <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/244255.html">to visit</a> <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/306344.html">universities</a>, I couldn’t pass by the University of Mexico City, which is even listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
<p/>

Some buildings are truly unusual.

As usual, I went looking for the mathematics department. Here mathematics is included in the area of interest of the Faculty of Science.
<p/>

The first building I wandered into was occupied by chemists.

<p>
The main technical difference from Europe is that here, like in Russia, they write on the boards with chalk, not felt-tip pens.
<p/>

And the building looks newer than in the USSR.

Employee articles that have been published in good journals are displayed on the stand.

In some places, boards hang right in the corridors. On the floor below, two students were solving some problem in differential geometry right on the blackboard.

The buildings here are connected by a complex multi-level system of transitions.

In many classrooms there are no desks; instead, these are the chairs.

The work of the administration with students is interestingly organized. There are many windows in one place where you can get different pieces of paper.

A similar system is being implemented in Russia in the form of “Multifunctional centers for the provision of public services,” but trash, insanity and sodomy are still happening at the university.

I wanted to have lunch at the student canteen, but they only served food there with coupons. I had to be content with food from one of the many cafeterias.

Mexico City is one of the largest cities in the world. It’s good that it has many convenient metro lines; you don’t need to understand the bus system and stand in traffic jams. The fare is inexpensive - 5 pesos ($0.40). For those who can't count, it is written at the box office how much 1,2,3...27...50 tickets cost.
<p/>

At rush hour there is quite a crowd in the metro, just like in Moscow.

The interchanges are very long, you have to walk for 10 minutes. In the passages they organize exhibitions and put up instructive stands.

Although Mexico City is built on a grid, with skyscrapers concentrated in one area, it is not like American cities because the buildings are much more chaotic in height.

Usually I remember all the places I want to go to in a particular city, or I navigate using a tourist map. In especially large cities, when I stay for many days, I usually write down a list of places on my laptop and cross off the ones I visit every day. In Mexico City I didn’t have time to go to some places; three days is really not enough even with my productivity.

To complete the picture, I’ll give you my route around Mexico City.
Day 0 (travelling from Queretaro to Puebla): walk through the old center, from the main square to the beginning of Reforma Avenue.
Day 0.5: check into the hotel late in the evening. The hotel was in the center, so I constantly walked along different streets there.
Day 1: On this day everything went wrong. I overslept, then got cheated out of 100 pesos at the bus station, then I went the wrong way and entered the pyramids from the back entrance, wasting a lot of time. Then I only managed to go to Coyoacan, but it turned out that it was Monday, and the Leon Trotsky Museum, which I found after long adventures, was closed.
Day 2: trip to Cuernavaca, Xochimilco, the Trotsky Museum, climb to the observation deck.
Day 3: university, Luis Barragán’s house, Chapultepec Park (I didn’t have time to get to the castle), Reforma Avenue, Revolution Monument, more aimless wandering around the center, airport.

The main pedestrian street, I lived two steps away from it for ridiculous money - only 13 dollars a day.

Near the pyramids there is a funny advertisement: everyone is invited to their restaurant, which is simply called by number.

Trotsky managed to live in Austria before the revolution of 1917, then was deported from there, from France, from Spain, moved to the USA, decided to return to Russia after the overthrow of the monarchy, and managed to be deported from Canada. After Stalin came to power, he was deported to Alma-Ata, then to Turkey, Norway and finally to Mexico. Here he was killed by Stalin's agent, who is now buried in Moscow under the name Ramon Ivanovich Lopez.

Mexico City and its surrounding areas probably have a record number of World Heritage sites. In addition to the center of Mexico City itself, separate sites include the university, the pyramids of Teotihuacan, the excavations of Xochicalco, a number of 16th-century churches (one of which I saw in Cuernavaca), and also this house. Apparently, it got there the same way as that <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/239503.html">house from Brno</a>.
<p/>

Almost a separate city is Xochimilco, an area where the Aztecs dug canals. Now people come here to celebrate birthdays: rent a boat and go for a ride.

<h2>Cuernavaca</h2>
<p>
In 1910 there was <i>Stability</i>(tm) in Mexico. 34 years earlier, in 1876, Porfirio Diaz became president. When he served out his term, for the first time he put someone in his place, and the next time he did not bother to comply with the constitution, each time receiving 146% in the elections. The people approved of the <i>National Leader</i>, who saved the country from the turbulent 1860s, raised it from its knees, so that all Mexicans began to dress better and eat rye and vegetables, that’s all. The National Leader was opposed by a bunch of liberal creaks who lived on grants from the State Department, but they did not enjoy popular support and always lost in the elections. In 1910, Mexico held the <s>Olympics</s> celebration of its centenary of independence. But in 1910, something went wrong. (<i>This is irony, I am drawing parallels with the history of Putin's reign in early 2000's and using the popular Russian memes</i>) 
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256237543_017ba48c5e_o.jpg">
<p>
The main problem in Mexico was the lack of land among the peasants. At the beginning of the 20th century, Mexico was an agrarian country with communal farming (just like the Russian Empire), but during the reign of Diaz, most of the land ended up in the hands of local landowners (latifundistas). This happened because the Indian peasants did not have any documents for the land where they had farmed for many generations, so the tricksters were able to quietly privatize it. Mexico needed at least something like Stolypin's reform to solve the agrarian question, but the government did nothing, and discontent accumulated. The reason was easy to find: in 1910, Diaz once again won 146% in the elections, and sent his opponent Francisco Madero to prison right on election day. Everyone was stunned by such impudence, and an uprising broke out in several regions.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256785104_14e94c7a41_o.jpg">
<p>
At this time, the country first learned about two popular leaders: Pancho Villa in the north in the state of Chihuahua and Emiliano Zapata in the state of Morelos south of Mexico City (where Cuernavaca is located). They advocated radical land reform with the forced taking of land from landowners. Francisco Madero himself was more restrained in this regard, because he understood that, having come to power, he would have to negotiate. Diaz's army lost to the rebels, and in the spring of 1911 the National Leader resigned and went on vacation to France, and Madero became the president.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256237583_aeca22ca1a_o.jpg">
<p>
As usual, the treason began immediately. Madero was in no hurry to distribute land to peasants and factories to workers; in fact, he did not really do anything during his presidency. Within a couple of months after Madero was elected president, Zapata declared him a traitor to the revolution and resumed guerrilla activities. Madero also did not carry out any lustrations; on the contrary, half of the government remained the same, and he appointed Victoriano Huerta, a former army general of Diaz, as commander of the army of the north. This turned out to be a very reckless decision: when Diaz’s nephew decided to start an uprising in 1913, Huerta, sent to fight with him, suddenly changed his color and staged a coup in Mexico City. Madero was overthrown and killed, and a military junta led by President Huerta came to power. Though, Diaz’s nephew was immediately thrown out of the country as the ambassador to Japan.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256935533_e7b08ce4c8_o.jpg">
<p>
The revolutionaries of the first wave did not like this turn of events, since they perceived what happened as a kind of Thermidor, the return of the old order, although in words Huerta promised all the same reforms (in particular, he wanted to privatize land using vouchers). Huerta's main opponent was Venustiano Carranza, governor of the northern state of Coahuila, who called for respect for the constitution and holding elections. Villa and Zapata united in the fight against the junta. As a result, Huerta lasted only a year in power, and already in 1914 he himself went into exile.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256785169_ba1cdda92a_o.jpg">
<p>
After another victory in the revolution, a Convention was created, at which the leaders of the revolutionary armies had to agree on who the main revolutionary was. It was decided that Carranza should resign as interim president; he did not agree with this and fled to Veracruz to gather an army. Mexico City remained under the control of Villa and Zapata.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257777475_88bafc49c4_o.jpg">
<p>
For the peasant leaders, this was the peak of their success: almost the entire territory of the country was under their control, with the exception of the Gulf Coast. But then they lost everything.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257080630_5ac19b1274_o.jpg">
<p>
Due to the lack of effective command and coordination between the detachments of Villa and Zapata, the war did not go according to plan. Instead of uniting the armies, they began to act individually, and individually they were defeated, and they had to return to the partisans.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256785039_861dc44777_o.jpg">
<p>
Carranza played his trump card: he once again promised to distribute land to everyone. Meanwhile, in Morelos, Zapata had already begun to implement a similar plan, confiscating land from the landowners in favor of the peasants.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257080820_91d43a2224_o.jpg">
<p>
To this day, the coat of arms of the state of Morelos says “Tierra y Libertad”, which is translated as “Land and Freedom”. The Mexican revolutionaries borrowed the motto from the Russians.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257080955_2be0116c7a_o.jpg">
<p>
Meanwhile, the ousted dictator Huerta received money from Germany to stage a coup and bring Mexico into World War I on the side of the Germans. However, the unlucky Mexican Lenin was tied up at the border by American border guards.

After the defeat of Villa and Zapata, the country came under the control of Carranza. In 1916, in the city of <a href="../guadalajara">Queretaro</a> a new constitution was adopted for Mexico. It annulled all the seizures of land by the latifundists, committed during the reign of Diaz, and the land began to be gradually given to peasants and communities. Along the way, the minerals were declared state property, which displeased the United States, who tried to invade, but were rebuffed.

The adoption of a new constitution in 1917 is traditionally considered the date of the end of the revolution, although the revolution continued further.

Let's look at the fate of the main characters. Venustiano Carranza became President of Mexico in 1917. In 1920 there was a coup d'etat, during which he was overthrown and killed. The coup was organized by Alvaro Obregon, who was the commander-in-chief of Carranza's army during the revolution. He became the new president, holding this post for 8 years, until he was killed by a student fanatic.

Pancho Villa, after the defeat of his army by Carranza, continued guerrilla warfare in northern Mexico. For a long time, the Americans supplied weapons to Mexico through the northern border, the area controlled by Villa. But when the United States decided to support the Carranza regime, the supply of weapons stopped. Villa organized a raid on US territory in order to loot weapons. This was used by the Americans to attempt a punitive operation in northern Mexico, but Villa remained elusive thanks to the support of the local population. However, his army melted away, and he could no longer capture any major city.

After the murder of Carranza in 1920, Villa was able to negotiate an amnesty with the new government. He was given a large estate, and the soldiers who remained with him were given a good pension. However, the prosperous life was short-lived. In 1923, Pancho Villa was killed and his car was shot at by an armed detachment. There is no clear answer as to what exactly caused the murder. Perhaps the authorities did not want Villa to return to politics.
One version of the song La Cucaracha is dedicated specifically to the murder of Villa.

Emiliano Zapata was assassinated in 1919. He was going to negotiate peace with the general of Carranza's troops, but instead he was simply shot.

The memory of Zapata is still alive. This is practically the Mexican Che Guevara, a personality who has become almost legendary. And today in the south of Mexico there are guerrillas who call themselves the Zapatista Army of National Liberation.
