<h1>East Timor: Dili, Baucau, Manatuto</h1>
<i>16-19 May 2016</i>
<h2>Dili</h2>
<p>
The most interesting thing about East Timor is its history, although it is not particularly exciting, which seems to indicate the general dullness of the country. The Portuguese were the first to colonize Indonesia to take control of the spice trade, later the Dutch came there, and in the 17th century, as a result of the war, Indonesia went to the Dutch, and the Portuguese took Brazil instead. Portugal only had half of the island of Timor left, which no one really needed. Timor was so useless that the Portuguese built almost nothing there for 400 years, and did not even teach the locals the Portuguese language (even in Africa, the colonies speak Portuguese). Timor remained a colony until the 1970s. When Portugal surrendered all its colonies, the communists climbed to power in Timor. And nearby, Indonesia has long been itching to grab something, and here is such an excellent candidate. Operation “East Timor is ours” was applauded by the international community that did not need new commie states in Asia. But something did not go quite according to plan, and the Timorese did not accept joining Indonesia. When the revolution took place in Indonesia in 1998, East Timor held a referendum and decided to secede. In response to this, the Indonesians, leaving, destroyed everything they could, driving the newly created country to the bottom, where it remains to this day.

We are approaching Dili. It is the smallest capital in Southeast Asia.

Fast food prices are almost the same as in Switzerland - a sure sign of a very poor country. In rich countries, Burger King will be the cheapest restaurant. In East Timor there is not even a cola dispenser or a refrigerator - they give you a warm can. Internet inside is bad - local 3G is better.

The Internet costs much more than in Indonesia, but it is convenient for tourists - for three days I just bought Unlimited data for $1 every day.

East Timor has four languages. Two official ones: Tetum and Portuguese, and two working ones: English and Indonesian. Let me explain the situation.
There are many different peoples living on the island of Timor, some speak Austronesian languages ​​(related to Indonesian), others speak Papuan languages ​​(related to other languages ​​of New Guinea). The Tetum language was the means of international communication on the island before colonization. Nowadays, quite a lot of people speak Tetum in West Timor, which belongs to Indonesia. In East Timor, the language used is "Tetu,-Dili", which originated from the capital Dili. This language is Portuguese-Tetum mix, where at least half of the words are taken from Portuguese and written as if in phonetic transliteration: nasoins, avizu, kartaun and so on. Tetun-Dili is the lingua franca of East Timor, including speakers of other Tetum dialects who live mainly on the southern coast.
Here is a text in Tetum.

<p>
Since East Timor was part of Indonesia from 1975 to 1999, the official language was then Indonesian. It was left as a "working" language, and you can see signs and announcements in Indonesian. In addition, most of the goods are imported from Indonesia, and, of course, no one alters the labels. Indonesian noodles are sold here.

Some old monuments remain from Indonesia. Like Soviet monuments with hammers and sickles in Tajikistan.

<p>
After the end of the Indonesian occupation, Timor was governed for several years by UN peacekeeping forces, hence, apparently, the “working” status of the English language. With a local you have the best chance of communicating in English.

What attracted me most was the opportunity to speak Portuguese. In practice, while the Portuguese owned Timor, they did not really teach the Timorese their language, although they contributed to the emergence of the local creole language. After liberation from Indonesia, Portuguese was made the official language according to the principle “as long as it is not the language of the occupiers.” Office work is conducted in Portuguese simply because it contains all the necessary technical words that may not be present in Tetum-Dili. Many inscriptions and signs are in Portuguese. But for locals it’s a foreign language: finding a person who speaks Portuguese is not easy (but I managed). They also play songs in Portuguese in the minibuses.
The easiest way to see Portuguese is on the signs.

Food is bad in East Timor. Here, for example, are the prices in the cheapest establishment I found. For reference, a pancake without filling (Roti kosong) in Malaysia costs 1/3 of a dollar, Fried rice (Nasi Goreng) in Indonesia is $0.7, with lamb (Nasi Goreng Kambing) - $1.5-2, Martabak (an Indonesian pie) - also in the area $1.

Everything else is mostly imported. In one of the parks I came across a local “farmer’s fair”, you can appreciate the degree of development of agriculture and the food industry in East Timor. No comments.

There are not very many tourists here, but much more than this place deserves. If East Timor were part of Indonesia, then five foreigners would come here a year, because Timor is far away and there is not much to see. But since this is a separate country, there is a small stable flow here. There used to be two hostels in the capital, but now one has closed.

Fast boat written off from somewhere. I don't know where it goes. In theory, there should be two routes from Dili: to the island of Atauro, which is visible on the horizon every day, and to Oecussi (this is a semi-enclave separated from the rest of the country).

I spent most of the third day in the hostel, because there was nothing to do in Dili, and I had already walked around almost all the streets. In the evening I crawled out to the lighthouse.

<h2>Baucau</h2>
<p>
On the second day I went to explore East Timor. The journey to Baucau - the second most populous city in the country with a population of as many as 16 thousand - is 120 kilometers, 3 hours and 4 dollars.

East Timor is a small country, from Dili to the very edge of the island the distance is only 250 kilometers, however, the road after Baucau, judging by the reviews, is bad, and transport is rare, so the drive can take about 10 hours. Attractions are extremely rare, mostly dilapidated Portuguese churches. There are beaches, but there is no infrastructure, it is expensive and very uncomfortable. I decided that there was no point in going to the edge of the island; it would be enough to see a couple of non-capital cities. Therefore, from Baucau I went back towards Dili and got off halfway in the city of Manatuto - the regional center. The plan was to spend the night there and visit the beach. But I quickly stopped liking this idea when I realized that the beach looked like this:

Yes, of course, compared to Crimea, this is just paradise - the stones and dirt are the same, but it’s not cold and there are no people. But compared to Indonesia and Malaysia, this is very bad; I had no desire to go into the sea.
