<h1>Senegal: Dakar, Mbour, Bandia</h1>

<h2>Dakar</h2>
<p>
Dakar is the main city of West Africa. It is located on the Cap Vert Peninsula, the westernmost point of the continent.

<p>
I stayed in a hotel in the Yoff area. It is convenient because buses to the airport leave from here (and in Dakar the airport is very far from the city, even a bus costs 10 dollars, and a taxi is about 40). It seems to be a relatively wealthy area.

The main streets are paved.
<p/>

<p>
Smaller streets are covered with sand.

<p>
There is a metrobus stop on the main street. In principle, you can move around Dakar quite efficiently by public transport - there is also a modern electric train, which they are planning to extend to the airport soon.

It is forbidden to ride a cart.
<p/>

<p>
There really are carts here.

Let's see the historical center of the city.
<p/>

<p>
The train station is beautiful (but there is a lot of police around, so I was afraid to take pictures). Trains to Mali used to go from here.

In general, there is not much colonial architecture, mostly something like this:

The main attraction of Dakar is Gorée Island. It is listed as a World Heritage Site, as it is an example of a colonial city of the 18th century. There were few colonies in Africa at that time, so such places are rare. The rare colonies and coastal forts at that time were mainly used for the slave trade - slaves from the mainland were collected here and then transported by ships to America.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945048747_16fd054c67_h.jpg" >
<p>
Ferries go to the island, but not very often - about once every 2 hours. And you have to come well in advance, otherwise you won't get on the next ferry, because places are limited.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946286184_7b08b3715d_h.jpg" >
<p>
The island is very small, you can walk from one end to the other in about 20 minutes, and across in 5-10.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946408140_b8e874be79_h.jpg" >
<p>
First I went to the part of the island where the fortress on the rock is located.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946286189_2c6dffe79a_h.jpg" >
<p>
The paths and squares are covered with sand.

Ascent.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946210873_565163c11e_h.jpg" >
<p>
The map showed a path around the perimeter of the fortress, so I headed there.
<p/>

<p>
Beautiful rocks, like basalt.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946286129_99956b2327_h.jpg" >
<p>
The path became narrow.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946210823_ec39bc92bb_h.jpg" >
<p>
And ended. In fact, there was a way - to climb up the fire escape to the top of the wall, but I did not.
<p/>

<p>
Let's enter the fortress from the normal entrance. There is a monument in the center.

Below is the residential part of the island. The population here is almost 2000 people, which seems like a lot.

In Dakar, in addition to the center, there are many interesting places scattered over a large area. Where I definitely wanted to go was Cape Almadies, the westernmost point of Africa.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945947731_fa4ad31091_h.jpg" >
<p>
As I understood, all sorts of restaurants are open here in the evening, but I arrived in the morning, and it was completely empty.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946407270_c87ad71030_h.jpg" >
<p>
To get to the beach, I had to go through the narrow passages of the market, and then through some backyards with smelly fish.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946285564_f492977b21_h.jpg" >
<p>
And here it is, Cape Almadies.

The area near Cape Almadies is clearly an elite place. The sidewalk is clean and has tiles! The US Embassy is behind the fence on the right.
<p/>

I wonder how much real estate costs here. A quick search showed figures around $80k for a studio.

<h2>Mbour</h2>
<p>
Mbour is a large city south of Dakar. I stopped there to see Senegal outside the capital, and to visit the nature reserve nearby. The city turned out quite bad...

I went from the border in this shared taxi. It is called sept-place (seven seats).

From the inside, it looks something like this. This is the most common form of transport in West Africa. In English, they are also called bush taxis.

You can often see traditional houses with thatched roofs.

Arriving in Mbour, I spent about an hour and a half looking for a hotel. There was nothing around the bus station. There were several hotels on the Internet, but they were very far away and expensive. In the end, I found this trash. The worst part was that the water didn't work. They gave me a couple of large canisters to pour water from. Well, at least the air conditioning worked, but for $35 I would have liked something better. Perhaps the only really bad and expensive hotel in Africa for all my trips so far.

There's not much to see in Mbour, except for the pink mosque.

I took a motorcycle taxi to the beach. All the hotels are right here, so it's like a beach town.
<p/>

If it weren't for the dirt and a lot of people, it could be nice.

In the evening, the second stage of suffering began - I walked for a long time looking for where to eat. My requirement was simple - that there be hot food. I found something with great difficulty.
<p/>

There was no menu, they just offered chicken, I agreed. The food was so-so.

<h2>Bandia</h2>
<p>
Not far from Mbour there is a small reserve called Bandia. It is easy to get to it, since the entrance is right on the main highway going to Dakar, you can just take any passing bus, and walk from the highway in 10 minutes. So I didn't miss the opportunity to go on safari in West Africa too.
<p/>

<p>
Prices. Entrance costs $20, plus you need to hire a car with a guide. I quickly teamed up with other tourists, and in the end I paid 40 euros for everything - it was the cheapest safari ever.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945952381_270ff13247_h.jpg" >
<p>
There are several enclosures near the entrance. Turtles live in one.

Hyenas live in another. Predators are not allowed to roam freely, because they could eat too much.

The reserve is quite small in area, the distances are short, so the probability of seeing the animals that are here is very high. We met someone all the time. Antelopes.
