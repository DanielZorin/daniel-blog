<h1>Spain: Santander, Burgos, Logrono, Bilbao</h1>
<i>6-8 December 2023</i>
<h2>Santander</h2>
<p>
Another small little-known region in the north of Spain is Cantabria. The name of its capital, Santander, is glorified by the bank of the same name, whose branches can be found not only in Spain.

Santander is near the ocean on a peninsula, but the city center faces the bay.

<p>
Of all the cities on this trip, Santander has the most luxurious balconies. Only <a href="../galicia">La Coruña</a> can compete with it.

<p>
This is a whole area of ​​balconies, just east of the old center.

New houses also have so many balconies, but not as elegant.

<p>
The city is located on a hill, and I am already relatively high compared to the embankment. There is a residential area around.

<h2>Burgos</h2>
<p>
I found myself again in the province of Castile and Leon. The city of Burgos is located in the northeast, and is notable for its cathedral, listed as a World Heritage Site.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53399451766_18cbd6bf46_o.jpg" >
<p>
In the evening the center was very lively.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53399642028_9d92a489b4_o.jpg" >
<p>
I tried to find somewhere to eat, but everywhere was crowded.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53398522477_15c9d10922_o.jpg" >
<p>
Though, almost everyone sat with a glass of wine and, at most, a small snack. In Spain, the main meal of the day is lunch, when all these bars offer combo menus for 10-15 euros, and dinner is a time to chat with friends.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53399641978_797645e78b_o.jpg" >
<p>
As a result, I ate inexpensively at an Asian establishment.

More than the cathedral, I was impressed by the preserved medieval gate to the old city, with rows of statues.

<h2>Logroño</h2>
<p>
La Rioja is the smallest region in mainland Spain, and it's also off the main roads and requires quite a bit of maneuvering to get there. The name Rioja is associated primarily with wine - it is the most popular place of origin of Spanish wine. The capital of La Rioja is called Logroño.
<p/>

There is such a roof between the bus station and the railway station.
<p/>

The station is some distance from the center, you can walk through the residential areas.

Surprisingly, many groups of tourists were taken around the city. And I thought no one really comes here. There were fewer tourists in other cities.

<h2>Bilbao</h2>
<p>
I was passing through Bilbao to fly from the local airport to the south. I was here <a href="../bilbao">in 2014</a>. There was a public holiday in Spain, and finding a hotel at a normal price was somehow completely unrealistic, everywhere at least 70 euros. I had to stay in a hostel for as much as 20 euros, and 10 years ago I paid that much for a hotel.

I limited myself to a walk through the busiest part of the city with wide streets.

There are a lot of people here, but there are also a lot of bars. I also found one that started working before 6 (when most locals arrive).

Pintxos are a variety of sandwiches with incredible combinations of jamon, shrimp and other ingredients.

They say that this is an analogue of tapas from other regions of Spain, but I would not concur. Tapas are a complete simple dish, just smaller in size, they cost around 7-8 euros, and are usually called simply: “shrimp”, “sausage”, “Russian salad”, “cheese plate”, etc. The Basques have these small sandwiches with unusual combinations. Each sandwich costs around 2 euros.
