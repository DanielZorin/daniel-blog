<h1>Iran: Rasht, Masuleh, Fouman, Ardabil, Tabriz</h1>
<i>28-31 August 2022</i>
<h2>Rasht</h2>
<p>
The north of Iran, off the coast of the Caspian Sea, is quite popular among local tourists due to the climate - it is not a desert, but rather a damp mountainous area, similar to Transcaucasia. You can see it very clearly when you turn from Tehran onto Rasht, the road goes down sharply, and dense forests begin around you. Rasht is the largest city in the region, although it's 20 kilometers from the seashore (there are only small towns on the shore).
<p/>

<p>
The city has some European (or rather Turkish) flair, thanks to the presence of a pedestrian tourist center.
<p/>

<p>
The benches are standing.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52418926391_c891faac85_o.jpg">
<p>
But there are practically no restaurants, which distinguishes very poor countries from middle and rich ones. The entire center is full of shops, and only in the side streets do shawarma shops open, where you can buy something to eat, mostly for takeaway.
<p/>

<p>
The central square has several European-style buildings.

In Iran, you can often find people with a bandage on their nose - this means they have recently undergone plastic surgery, which is popular here, to reduce their nose.

In the evening I wanted to have dinner, but I couldn’t find anything in the center except these burger joints.

<p>
There wasn't really anywhere to sit there. In the end, I got desperate, took a taxi and went to the Golsar district, which was designated in the guidebook as a fashionable area of ​​the city where young people hang out.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52419204639_16d3cf9b94_o.jpg">
<p>
Indeed, this area looks more respectable - there is no trade from the sidewalk.
<p/>

And store windows are more expensive and respectable.

And then I finally found restaurants and went to an establishment with European food for a change.

<p>
Back in Rasht, for the first and last time in Iran, I found a grocery supermarket, for the sake of this occasion I took some photos of the price tags (they are in rials). Coca-Cola costs 165,000 rials (in street stores they usually charged 200k, but once it was 150).

<h2>Masuleh</h2>
<p>
There are two interesting places in the mountains near Rasht. The first is the historical village of Masuleh. There are not many places in Iran that have preserved traditional architecture, and this is one of them. The drive from Rasht takes about an hour.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52419444078_be7a8f149e_o.jpg">

<p>
The village is located on the slope of a mountain, somewhat reminiscent of <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/670566.html">Jiufen</a>.

<p>
The main unique feature of Masuleh is that here the roofs of the houses form a sidewalk for the street above.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52419444008_e844125eb0_o.jpg">
<p>
That's why everyone takes pictures right on the roofs.

Masuleh turned out to be almost the most touristy place in Iran; all the streets are simply packed with local tourists taking selfies.

Masuleh is inhabited mainly by Talysh, a people related to the Persians. Half of the Talysh live in the south of Azerbaijan, where in 1993 they even tried to create autonomy.

<h2>Fouman</h2>
<p>
The second interesting place near Rasht is Rudkhan Castle. The nearest town is called Fouman, you can take a taxi from there.

<p>
There were even more tourists near the castle than in Masouleh. The line of cars to enter was about two kilometers long, my taxi driver brazenly drove around it in the oncoming lane, and then had difficulty finding where to park.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52419464098_c67b3441c3_o.jpg">
<p>
On the road from Fouman there are often people along the roads offering to rent accommodation (the sign says “villa”).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52419231599_76420f2547_o.jpg">
<p>
You still have to walk to the castle; it’s a 200  meter climb up the stairs. Along the path there are all sorts of stalls, the further you go, the fewer.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52418953576_238b46d19b_o.jpg">

Most of the locals seem to come here to picnic because as the altitude increases there are fewer people.

<h2>Ardabil</h2>
<p>
Moving further from Rasht towards the Turkish border, I initially planned to go back a little towards Tehran to the city of Qazvin, and from there along the main highway to Tabriz. But I changed my mind and decided to go only forward, along the seashore through another regional center - Ardabil. It's a little shorter, the road is more interesting, but there is little public transport, on the other hand, taxis in Iran are super cheap.
<p/>

<p>
The road runs along the seashore to the north to the border with Azerbaijan. In the city of Astara, divided by the border into two cities of the same name, I changed to another taxi to Ardabil. After this, the road goes along the border through the mountains for a long time. On the right is Azerbaijan.

Ardabil has one important attraction - the mausoleum of Sefi ad-Din, the founder of the Safavid dynasty, which ruled Azerbaijan in the 14th-15th centuries, and all of Iran in the 16th-18th centuries (before the Qajars).

In Iran, they often make a physical separator for traffic flows if the number of lanes in one direction and the other is different (as here there is only one lane towards you, but there are three from me).

<h2>Tabriz</h2>
<p>
Tabriz is one of the largest cities in Iran and the capital of Iranian Azerbaijan. Half of historical Azerbaijan is located in Iran; even more people speak Azerbaijani here than in independent Azerbaijan. Interestingly, Azerbaijani was the lingua franca in this region until the 20th century, and many dynasties of Iranian rulers spoke Azerbaijani, and Persian was the language of the common people (much like the nobility spoke French in the Russian Empire).
