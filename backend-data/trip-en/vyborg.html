<h1>Russia: Saint Petersburg, Sestroretsk, Vyborg</h1>
<i>13-20 July 2013</i>
<h2>Saint Petersburg</h2>
<p>
Moscow consists of 12 districts, of which I have not been to only one (Troitsky). St. Petersburg consists of as many as 18 districts, of which I have not yet been to four: Krasnoselsky, Kolpinsky, Kirovsky and Frunzensky. In July, I spent most of my time at the conference, but one day I was able to set aside time after lunch to visit one of the remote areas of the city - Kurortny district ("Resort district"). In addition, there are many historical places associated with the 1917 revolution and Lenin.
<p/>

<p>
Sestroretsk is a resort and cottage community. Even the train station I got to is called “Resort”. Theoretically, you can sometimes swim on the beach if it is not very cold. But not that day.
<p/>

<p>
A cold wind was blowing and there was almost no one on the beach.
<p/>

<p>
The city of Sestroretsk is practically St. Petersburg Rublyovka (Moscow elite suburb). It doesn't take long to get to the center by car from here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256438970_a5586917f0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Just like on Rublyovka, here mere mortals still live side by side with the rich.
<p/>

<p>
Sestroretsk is sensitive to the problem of garbage.

At the station.

<p/>

<p>
There are two monuments to Lenin in Sestroretsk. One is standing near some sanatorium. Painted white, which is rare.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257568514_da9fd5b329_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The second one is located on the main square. Looks the same as in <a href="../dmitrov">Dmitrov</a>, only with fingers.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255598878_e6786fb1c4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
From Sestroretsk I walked on foot through the villages of Razliv and Tarkhovka. Naturally, there is nothing to see in the villages in terms of architecture, but there are plenty of monuments to Lenin there. This one is located near the Razliv railway station.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256142594_5e9201d33c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is where Lenin's Barn is located. Lenin hid in Razliv in the summer of 1917 after the so-called July Days, when he tried to overthrow the Provisional Government. After the failure of the coup, Kerensky banned the Bolshevik party, and Lenin himself was wanted, so he fled to Razliv, where he lived under the guise of a Finnish fisherman. Later, Lenin went even further, to Finland, and returned back closer to the October revolution.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254663392_0bdd34543f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The barn is quite easy to get to following road signs. Near the barn there is a cute miniature monument to Lenin.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256142669_ba92a7d453_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Let's go ahead. Suddenly, the Curonian Spit and sand dunes are right in St. Petersburg.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254663432_9e01f59b36_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here is Lake Razliv itself.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254663477_df2fff393e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In these places, near the village of Tarkhovka, walking along the shore is problematic, there are swamps. I had to get out onto the road through a labyrinth of some sections, and once I even had to climb over a fence. Near the Tarkhovka station there is a chic monument, where instead of the word “Hollywood” it is written “Lenin”.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255395551_6d2e4230f2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Opposite is the hammer and sickle. The road between these two monuments will eventually lead to the Lenin's Hut Museum, but this museum doesn't show up on Google Maps when searched, so I had no idea exactly how long to walk.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254663562_77d223cdd4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
So, it's a very long walk. About an hour. At some point, I realized that I would no longer be able to catch the train I was interested in, but I decided not to give up and still reach my goal.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256142804_b85b418b22_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Apparently, the museum is popular among foreign tourists who are interested in the life of this legendary criminal.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256142814_3b07c5e5d5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The last march - and here it is! Lenin lived in this hut with Zinoviev, but when history was rewritten by the Ministry of Truth under Stalin, this fact was seemingly forgotten.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254663627_74a0d9ad94_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The hut was immortalized in granite.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256439530_88160c3302_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Lenin's head is nearby.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256439490_5b3bbe9a7e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And this place is called the "Green Office". Eh, probably in Soviet times people viewed this museum with serious faces and reverence. It must have been a funny sight.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254663687_afcf6da48e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I was completely exhausted from the hike of about 20 kilometers, but, fortunately, opposite the hut there is a pier from which ferries run across the lake to Sestroretsk, and just one of them was leaving.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255599243_1228ca62d7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On weekdays they run approximately once every two hours (only during the day), on weekends - every hour.
<p/>

St. Petersburg is crammed with places associated with Lenin. In those days when Lenin was a substitute for God, there were even more of them. In many areas, maps were drawn on the walls, on which all Lenin’s places were marked; now they, apparently, have disappeared (in Petrogradka they were painted over just a few years ago). There were dozens of monuments to Lenin in St. Petersburg; now some have been demolished, but many still stand. Most of the monuments are located on the territory of factories, where you cannot go, but about 20 of them are in public places (including cities like Pushkin and Sestroretsk that are technically part of St. Petersburg). I rented a room in the house where Lenin met with Krasin twice.
<p/>

<p>
Bust on Kamennoostrovsky Prospekt.
<p/>

<p/>

<p>
Another head of Lenin stands at the Lanskaya platform, near which was the last apartment where Lenin hid in 1917. On the day of the seizure of power, he traveled from there by tram to the Finland Station, from there on foot across the bridge and Shpalernaya Street to Smolny. Now there is a monument to Dzerzhinsky on Shpalernaya Street.
<p/>

<p>
The funny monument to Lenin near the St. Petersburg City Hall was apparently erected in honor of the 10th anniversary of the revolution.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254662522_c9719fda76_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The main monument to Lenin in St. Petersburg.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254662642_7b0acefe4c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Why here, it is written on the sign - he came back from exile and addressed the crowd here in 1917.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254662677_ad1a8230f3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The boards describe every little detail.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256438185_cc5a50c1b8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Every sneeze (Lenin was here on a meeting and talked about propaganda).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255597788_ff364165ac_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Sometimes it gets to the point of insanity (Lenin was a reader of this library).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255598118_b88be3d3c4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Plaque on the Kshesinskaya mansion, which was captured by the Bolsheviks and turned into headquarters after Lenin returned from exile in April 1917.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256141784_4ecdcd3406_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A monument to Lenin in the courtyard of some factory on Levashovsky Prospekt. Visible through the bars. The monument has practically no pedestal and stands in the bushes.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256142169_c2d7aba8ed_h.jpg"/>
<p>
An interesting monument stands in the courtyard of the Institute of Physical Education; it used to stand at the Warsaw Station, then was demolished from there, but during the reign of Putin it was restored in a new location.

<p>
A visit to St. Petersburg would not be complete without visiting local courtyards. I have already seen courtyards in the center and on Vasilyevsky Island, this time I looked at the courtyards of Petrogradka north of Bolshoy Prospekt. Next time I will need to walk through the Admiralteysky district in the area of the Obvodny Canal.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256142149_8061c847b0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Typical picture.

Entrance to a house on Petrogradka.
<p/>

<p>
Also Petrogradka.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256094642_6a3aa6085b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And in some places it’s cooler than in Paris.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254662357_8ac18dd736_h.jpg"/>
<p>
An innovative business has emerged in St. Petersburg, converting buses into paid toilets.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255597738_991f8e5beb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Fun minibus.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256438325_2235ca2e63_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Some traffic lights have the words “Wait” or “Go” on top. Others, when switching to a green light, say “Crossing such and such a street is allowed.”
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255597773_9adf4c2050_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Portraits of honorary residents of St. Petersburg are placed throughout the city. I wonder what percentage of residents are ashamed of such an honorary resident?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254662547_9d91ab5fdb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Still strange posters "Let's speak like St. Petersburgers." It would be logical to assume that they would explain the meaning of local words like “porebrik” and “badlon”, but there are just ordinary clerical or highly literary words.
<p/>

<p>
Finally I got to the Piskarevka cemetery.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256142019_7196814b98_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I was sure that there was a museum there, and it was either behind or under the monuments. There is actually an exhibition of photographs to the right of the entrance.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255598448_a4459a324b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The only exhibit.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255394816_d90975ef22_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It also turned out that the diary is kept in the museum of the Peter and Paul Fortress, there is only a photograph here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255598398_3f9d832d1d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Decorations were removed from part of the Summer Garden fence for restoration.
<p/>

<p>
Nevsky Prospekt is now made pedestrian on weekends, like Khreshchatyk.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256438340_890d2b3d4d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Posters.
<p/>

<p>
Row row fight the power!

<p>
Monument to Anna Akhmatova, looking at the prison on the opposite bank of the river.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256141874_b3ad13d37c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I went to a hipster place - New Holland.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255598658_bacb5fe3c3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The most interesting thing here is the rules of behavior at the entrance. For the first time in Russia - a civilized explanation of the rules and prohibitions!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256094712_2c263bd035_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I visited the Pyshechnaya (donut cafe) for the first time.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254662242_c9c570aeaa_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Actual donuts.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255597838_8613ca929d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Listened to the opera on St. Isaac's Square.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256438305_8dd6743d1d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
For the first time I attended a show for foreign tourists. The conference banquet was held in an expensive Russian restaurant, bread and salt, kokoshniks, Kalinka-Malinka and other songs and dances were included.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256142289_028504a4bf_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Just like that.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255394531_e3f6abb6e7_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Vyborg</h2>
<p>
The most famous view of Vyborg is here. But what is on the other side of this picture?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256774780_353adb1b11_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Commieblock? As if it's something bad. Let them stand on the outskirts.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255000777_83dabe2f80_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is roughly what is located there. This is actually a courtyard behind one of the buildings visible from the tower in the foreground. It seems that there is a hostel for migrant workers here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255000907_24f6571213_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The courtyards directly behind the town hall generally look ok.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256775045_87cacc9222_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Well, balconies from below are not painted.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256479529_89dcf58d79_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Next is this street. There are no paving stones on it now because it is being renovated. With paving stones, this street would probably look very picturesque, especially if the grass were cut and the houses were painted.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255000972_421fd24c4f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The bell tower, which is visible in the distance, is under threat of demolition.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257900465_c3541844c0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But nothing can save the church, to which the bell tower belongs.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255933463_a52cc4c9b5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Although it has been standing in this condition for about a year since 1944, so maybe it will still stand.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255933488_2a3d8de5c4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also an old house nearby. A memorial plaque lay a couple of hundred meters away, broken glass lies in the weeds.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255001087_3585053497_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Well, it's beautiful! Why did they find money to paint on the left, but not on the right?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255001122_dc0915b430_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This nondescript house once looked like <a href="../buenos-aires">Caminito</a> or <a href="../denmark">Nyhavn</a>
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255001202_f033755a27_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Now only the figure of a mermaid above the entrance reminds of its former greatness.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255001147_df0d5d50b8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
What follows is even sadder. This is not a warehouse, as one might think, but a ruined monastery.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256775405_9de4d292ed_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Vyborg is being demolished live, starting from the edge of the historical center. The issue of this building has been finally resolved.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255731521_b025d51163_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Now you can still see that the building was once excellent.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255001427_0ff47ea1ad_h.jpg"/>
<p>
What's next?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256775550_482275087b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Will they demolish this small house hidden in the yard?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256775635_54fc8889c3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
(By the way, this residential building has been here since the sixteenth century)
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256480089_f2e261a1b0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Will they rebuild it like this?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255933793_4fca9b24d6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At most, they will rent it out to entrepreneurs, like this tower, which is in such good condition because there is a restaurant there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255001317_7f25a9531f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And what is not suitable for a restaurant will be like <a href="../belarus">Bobruisk fortress</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256775675_a296d1dedc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Even in Mon Repos Park there are problems, although they are still somehow trying to maintain the brand.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255933028_995b13f474_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Famous actors used to come here for the film festival, but now this has faded away.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256479939_af7f17a4c9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is Vyborg.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256480244_d2414f47d8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
First - part of Sweden, then - a fortress that defended the newly founded St. Petersburg.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256775765_844b9994db_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Then - a city in the Grand Duchy of Finland, the second largest city in independent Finland.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256774705_feed742171_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And in the end - a Soviet province.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255000837_59ddbdc543_h.jpg"/>
<p>
