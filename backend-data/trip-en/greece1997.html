<h1>Greece: Athens, Corinth, Mycenae, Epidaurus, Argos, Hydra, Poros, Aegina</h1>
<i>June 25 - July 10, 1997</i>
<p>
In 1997 I was in Greece. We lived in Athens, but not in the city center, but near the beach. Now, remembering the name of the hotel, I googled that this is the neighboring city of Glyfada. I remember there was a large selection of excursions, we went to Mycenae and Epidaurus, as well as a small cruise to the islands near Athens - Aegina Island, Poros Island and Hydra Island.
