<h1>Russia: Naberezhnye Chelny, Yelabuga, Izhevsk, Kirov</h1>
<i>23-25 December 2018</i>
<h2>Naberezhnye Chelny</h2>
<p>
Naberezhnye Chelny is a city in Tatarstan, built from scratch in the 1970s around the KamAZ truck factory. We can say that this is a monument to the Brezhnev era: the architects designed an ideal city, as they saw it at that time. It turned out something like this: a city with square neighborhoods and wide avenues.

<p>
There is an airport in Chelny where Pobeda and many other airlines fly. This is the only Russian airport I have been to that does not have regular public transport. There are only special buses that run only a few times a day.

<p>
Panel houses are illuminated along the contour in different colors.

<p>
Sometimes there are constructivist monuments. Interestingly, in Naberezhnye Chelny there is no monument to Lenin in the city center.

<p>
A tall round tower in the middle of the city.

<p>
The central square looks like an airfield. From one end to the other, it’s probably 2 kilometers, and there’s almost nothing on it.
<p/>

<p>
This is me still walking across the square.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256521321_7d2e11adaf_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I reached the next street. There is a tram in the city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256722308_f8f146f37c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In Naberezhnye Chelny the streets are sooooo wide.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255793457_9f5b237f68_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I wonder why such streets were designed in the USSR, if according to the plans it was calculated that a maximum of 5% of the population would have a car?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256722208_332f7661f1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In Chelny, all blocks are square and have numbers. Although streets have names, addresses are usually called by block number   house number, as in Zelenograd near Moscow.
<p/>

<p>
Street signs in two languages.
<p/>

<p>
While traveling on a tram, I noticed the Eiffel Tower.
<p/>

<h2>Yelabuga</h2>
<p>
Yelabuga is the complete opposite of neighboring Naberezhnye Chelny, a small ancient city included in the list of historical cities of Russia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255031737_c5812e326c_h.jpg"/>

<p>
Level streets lined with 19th-century mansions, the city is perfectly preserved.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256805110_a98a4b007e_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255031692_9a220bf3a0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Due to the heavy snowfall, there were clearly fewer people on the streets than there could have been.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256805250_8bba0d0401_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255964043_46e6aedf35_h.jpg"/>
<p>
They managed to clear the main road of snow a little.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256805480_e102cdf5c1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The small streets are quiet and calm.
<p/>

<p>
Wooden houses.
<p/>

<p>
The house where the poetess Marina Tsvetaeva lived (and died).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255964133_b0f1a3e39f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the morning I went to look at the Devil's Settlement - the site of an ancient city a little away from the center. The path there goes through several parks.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255760526_5e0ecb0cb2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Monument to Gena and Cheburashka.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256804780_b51c8fb7a8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Everything was covered with snow.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255760591_da5c0d5f36_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I wanted to get to the tower, which is visible on the distant hill.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255963703_be28d84776_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A path was drawn on the map, but it was clearly passable only in the summer, when you can go down into the ravine without drowning in snowdrifts.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256804900_9979911466_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256509789_73df74ced8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I took a detour through a residential area where there was a clearer path.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256509849_19b6f14b5b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
However, it also turned out to be impassable.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256805025_5550d63571_h.jpg"/>
<p>
So I never made it to the top.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255760716_c20c21ec4e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I walked back along the main road of this one-story area.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255031612_39939787b4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The main church of Yelabuga. I didn’t find a mosque in the center; there is one large one away from the center.
<p/>

Unfrozen river.
<p/>

<p>
An unusual monument to Lenin - yes, it is a small head of Lenin on top of a tall obelisk.
<p/>

<h2>Izhevsk</h2>
<p>
The study of Russian regions took me to Izhevsk, the capital of the Republic of Udmurtia. The day was treacherously short, so I arrived in Izhevsk after dark.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257264745_dae1d88641_h.jpg"/>

<p>
Izhevsk is mainly known for its arms factory, which also produces Kalashnikov assault rifles.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257264490_1cbb0d1d32_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The city stands on the shore of a lake into which the Izh River temporarily floods. At the same time, there is a highway along the shore of the lake, and the embankment is built on a hill, along with the main part of the city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256421598_adc5d14428_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Unusual.
<p/>

<p>
Cathedral in the central square.
<p/>

<p>
Izhevsk Motor Plant, nice lighting.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257264585_e83695928c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
An ordinary shopping center is located in an unusual building. I don’t know what it was before, perhaps a library or a theater.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256970589_261431d8a5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Monument to Friendship of Peoples.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256421733_00597d5f5d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The church is the symbol of Izhevsk, which is printed on postcards and magnets.
<p/>

<p>
Rostelecom and the old panel.
<p/>

<p>
Central Street. Traditionally sooooo wide.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255492167_eb95c789b3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Tram station.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255492422_6e4620444e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also a mosque in the city center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255492097_fd91443817_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The coffee shop took the names of a chain of Thai and American stores, but for some reason did not copy the recognizable logo. Nobody would have gotten them in Izhevsk.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256970259_75858e989a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A monument to the robot Bender from Futurama, which is also an urn.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255492147_bb4d176947_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also a monument to the robots R2D2 and C3PO from Star Wars in Izhevsk.
<p/>

<p>
Shopping center in that area. Opposite him, I tried for about 30 minutes to squeeze into a minibus going in the right direction, but they were all somehow crowded.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256970779_aa92cae6c3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The monument to Lenin is far from the main one, but the most colorful. It is located in a residential area far south of the center, on the way to the station. Right at sidewalk level.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256970824_503b4aa192_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Izhevsk station is very beautiful. For some reason it is located very far from the city center.
<p/>

<h2>Kirov</h2>
<p>
Kirov a.k.a. Vyatka, another new region for me. The city is known for Dymkovo toys, Vyatka kvass, the trial of Navalny and the fact that one of the few large cities retained its Soviet name, although it is not immediately clear that it was derived from a surname; the city could have just received such a name. And before Vyatka the city was also called Khlynov.

<p>
On the main square is not Kirov, but Lenin. The Kirov monument is somewhere not in the center at all.
<p/>

After a steep descent you are in the Assumption Trifonov Monastery.

There is a small pedestrian street higher up the hill, I even missed it at first and had to return later in the evening.
