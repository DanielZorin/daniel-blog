<h1>Italy: Rimini, Venice, Montecatini Terme, Florence, Siena, Rome, Tivoli</h1>
<i>28 January - 4 February 2009</i>
<p>
In the winter of 2009 I went to Italy. It was a typical sightseeing tour with all its shortcomings - little time in cities, overnight stays far from the center. I flew into Rimini airport, which is often used for cheap flights, and from there I went straight to <a href="../san-marino">San Marino</a>. The next day we went to Venice and spent the night in Ravenna. In Venice the program was like this: first on a boat along the Grand Canal, then a little on a gondola around San Marco, the Doge's Palace, and then less than an hour of free time, so I didn't go further than San Marco.

There are surprisingly few people on San Marco.

I spent the next two days in Florence, the hotel was in a neighboring city, so I had to go to Florence by train. From there I went to Siena, although for some reason there were no photographs left.

For some reason, the photographs from Florence are also bad and there are few of them.

We had three days in Rome and the hotel was more or less in the center. I also visited the Vatican, including the museum with the Sistine Chapel.

In Rome, too, it was somehow deserted in winter.
