<h1>Russia: Oryol, Mtsensk</h1>
<i>April 17-22, 2005</i>
<p>
In the spring of 2005, I went to the All-Russian Russian Language Olympiad in Oryol. As part of the cultural program, we were taken on an excursion to Turgenev's estate Spasskoye-Lutovinovo and on the way there to the city of Mtsensk, in which I only remember the school where we had lunch. I took one of the prizes at the Olympiad.
