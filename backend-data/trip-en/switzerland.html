<h1>Switzerland: Buchs, St. Gallen, Zurich, Lucerne, Zug</h1>
<i>8-11 July 2013</i>
<h2>St. Gallen</h2>
<p>
Until you've been to Switzerland, you don't know what "expensive" is. Yes, there are places in the world where prices are even higher for objective reasons (all sorts of remote islands in the Pacific Ocean, where everything needs to be imported), but only in Switzerland are prices high in proportion to the high incomes of the population. If in Norway the average salary is around 3000 euro, then in Switzerland it is closer to 5000. We can say that Switzerland was lucky when after the Napoleonic Wars it was declared neutral, and all other regimes were interested in its stability in order to store their gold there.
Apricots cost $0.50 each, not bad, right?

The most expensive McDonald's in the world. A Big Mac costs about 240 rubles / $8, three times more expensive than in Russia.

<p>
One might assume that the people of Switzerland should look down on everyone since they are head and shoulders richer than virtually the rest of the world. But this is absolutely not true. I don’t like the high cost, but Switzerland definitely makes me feel good.

<p>
The northeastern part of Switzerland is mostly flat.

The towns resemble German ones.

I checked into the hostel, there were no people there. A hostel costs more than 1000 rubles ($30), and this is in St. Gallen! In Zurich, around 1600 ($50) per bed.

A distinctive feature is that the city is full of wooden fences.

There are no garbage cans in the city center; garbage is placed in bags on the street, as in <a href="http://juan-sin-tierra.livejournal.com/267388.html">Brussels</a>. Unlike Brussels, the bags are removed in a timely manner.
<p/>

<p>
The small town center is pleasant. On the one hand, the houses here are similar to German ones, on the other hand, the coloring is atypical for Germany.

<p>
St. Gallen is known as a center of textile production (as <a href="http://juan-sin-tierra.livejournal.com/226546.html">Ivanovo</a>), there is a textile museum, on the facade of which hangs a huge lace.

While in Russia they make <a href="http://juan-sin-tierra.livejournal.com/227874.html">swans from tires</a>, in Switzerland they are carved from wood.

<h2>Zurich</h2>
<p>
The first impression of Zurich was strange. I completely feel like I’m in <a href="http://juan-sin-tierra.livejournal.com/227757.html">Jakarta</a>. The parking lot is protected on all sides by huge, random coils of barbed wire, and this is in one of the safest countries in the world!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256525939_0f567baf48_o.jpg">

<p>
It turned out that I settled in the middle of the red light district (hence the comparative cheapness of the hotel - only 80 euros per room). At night, crowds of drunken schoolchildren walk the streets, and prostitutes stand at the entrances to brothels. There are no windows, like in <a href="http://juan-sin-tierra.livejournal.com/271476.html">Amsterdam</a>, they sit directly on the stands along the sidewalk.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255979483_e1c6c14605_o.jpg">
<p>
The hotel used an advanced system - no reception, you need to enter the booking code into the machine, and it will give out the key.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256525759_1a211ed955_o.jpg">
<p>
In Switzerland, despite the general high cost, not everywhere they try to skin you. Namely, here, more than anywhere else, you can often find drinking fountains that eliminate the need to buy water...
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255776501_4dfc3dfe08_o.jpg">
<p>
...and there are also free toilets.

The city of Zurich itself is of little interest.

<p>
But the main thing to do in Zurich is to sit on a bench on the main street and watch the trams rush past you about once a minute. In rare moments when there are no trams on either this or the opposite side of the street, you can see what is going on on the bench opposite.

<h2>Lucerne</h2>
<p>
Nothing shows that a person belongs to the lower classes of society more than the deep knowledge about expensive watches and cars.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256392341_42db3c34bc_o.jpg">
<p>
In Switzerland, crowds of people stare at store windows selling watches they will never buy.

<p>
Wristwatches are generally an inconvenient and useless thing in the age of mobile phones. It’s normal if you want to show your respectable status in this way, but many people take watches beyond their means to show off.
<p/>
