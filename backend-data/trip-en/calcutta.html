<h1>India: Bodh Gaya, Puri, Calcutta, Raxaul</h1>
<i>4-14 May 2017</i>
<h2>Gaya</h2>
<p>
The holiest place for Buddhists is in the state of Bihar. Here, under the Bodhi tree, Buddha achieved enlightenment. A tall temple now stands on this site. The security measures around it are such that nothing metal can be brought inside the cordon, including phones and cameras. So there is no need to prohibit photography - it is physically impossible. Here is a view of the temple from behind the fence.

<p>
From my visit there I still have a small leaf from the Bodhi tree.

<p>
There are a huge number of hotels for pilgrims in the surrounding area; it is better to stay here rather than near the station.

Wow, those are the familiar chef statues.

<p>
Every Buddhist country maintains its own monastery here (as in Sarnath). This Chinese one is the biggest.

The place of Buddha's enlightenment is called Bodh Gaya. About 10-15 kilometers from here is the large town of Gaya with a railway station. The road there goes along a dry river.

Gaya is a complete shithole, there is nothing to see in it.

<h2>Puri</h2>
<p>
Puri was the first coastal beach town on my trip. In general, in India, as you might guess, the beaches are very bad: like in other poor countries, they are mainly used as a landfill. On the coast of the Bay of Bengal there are no well-known resorts for thousands of kilometers around.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256670886_03db671074_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It is not customary for Indians to swim; everyone comes to the seashore to take selfies.
<p/>

<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256670791_136875c51a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The water in the sea is muddy, but you can live.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257417409_149de5420f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The beach is sandy and very wide. Moderately clean.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257418049_ab021d04bc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The most striking feature of Puri, which distinguishes it from all cities in the world, is that all hotels here have check-in and check-out at 8 am, maximum at 8-30. This is tough, I tell you.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256871553_38f81c7998_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is no resort infrastructure in this city at all. I lived on the second line from the beach; there were at most three restaurants within a radius of two kilometers from me. They also don’t work during the day, somehow I didn’t find anything except the vegetarian canteen at the Hare Krishna temple, where it was quite tasty, but in the hall they played “Hare Krishna, Hare Rama” on repeat. Basically, life is concentrated not near the station and the beach, but a little further, next to the Jagannath Temple. By the way, here restaurants are called “hotels”, as in Sri Lanka, which you will not find in northern India (but everywhere in the south).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257713735_beae0db085_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Occasionally, beautiful buildings are also found in Puri.
<p/>

<p/>

<p>
Basically the city looks like this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256872008_899eca19b7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the central square there is a temple of the god Jagannath - the main temple of this god, a very popular place of pilgrimage.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255943187_48f16ce956_h.jpg"/>
<p>
That's how many people are at the entrance.
<p/>

<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255943212_8d758b96a3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Non-believer people are not allowed inside (a frequent occurrence in Hindu temples).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255943252_bd0e0a8ef4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
So I just walked around the walls.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255943277_8bea8c4a09_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In this region, the shape of the domes of the temples is special, it is called “Kalinga”.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257713860_f49415fa96_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The statue of god Jagannath looks like this (in the left altar). Jagannath is sort of like an avatar of Vishnu and is worshiped mainly in the eastern part of the country.
<p/>

The statues in Puri are partially gilded.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255942802_82a5f4245e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
They sell mushrooms here, but I suspect that not agarics.

The Communist Party of India still exists and has some popularity, mainly in the east.

India is such a gloomy country that people here don't even smile in their own wedding photos. Real talk.

<p>
Near Puri, in the village of Konark, you can visit the Sun Temple, a World Heritage Site.
<p/>

<p>
Like all other UNESCO monuments, entrance for foreigners costs 500 rupees, in this case I spared the money and walked around the temple, fortunately it is very easy to do - the temple stands just below ground level, so instead of a fence there is a small rampart you can easily walk on, there is even a path leading there from the entrance, there are no fences.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256671056_bdb763b1d1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It seems to me that I didn’t really lose anything, because you can’t go inside the temple anyway, but everything from the outside is clearly visible from the wall.
<p/>

Actually, this is what the perimeter path looks like (where the cows walk).

If you really want to, you can jump down, it’s only a meter away.

<h2>Calcutta</h2>
<p>
Calcutta / Kolkata is a special city. Such image cannot be found in other cities of India; Although in small towns the standard of living is lower, there is no such contrast between a huge majestic city with elements of modern infrastructure and the Middle Ages going on in it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256732709_53e9b51b61_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Imagine that a herd of goats is being driven along the main street of New York - this is Calcutta.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257026920_d66b55396a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
From where to where? What does this herd even eat in the city center? Are they really nibbling grass in the parks?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256732729_de10df648c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Kolkata is the only city in India that still has pedestrian rickshaws. An absolutely inexplicable phenomenon: it would seem that the market should have solved them.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255981506_12f1c55283_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The speed of the “trip” on such “transport” is the same as on foot, even on a bicycle it is many times faster. The fare is only slightly lower than that of bicycle rickshaws, which are plentiful in Kolkata. Again, the price of the bike is not prohibitive, the maintenance costs are low. How do they even survive?

Kolkata is the only city in India where advertisements for prostitutes are posted on the streets, just like in St. Petersburg.

Dining room. If anyone thought that India was super cheap, then it is not so. It's cheap to eat beans (Dal, 10 rupees) or empty rice (15 rupees) with flatbread (8-14 rupees), a meat dish costs 120-130, that is, even more expensive than in Thailand.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256182763_2745275a95_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It seems that this establishment is more budget-friendly, but probably there are simply no meat dishes.

Not only in Russia, provincial officials solemnly open poles, garbage cans and bus stops with ribbons. In Calcutta, the mayor personally opened a toilet under the bridge; there were also three invited important guests; it was such an epic event that they filed down a memorial plaque.

Kolkata was the capital of India during British colonial times. Not surprisingly, the city center was largely built in Victorian style, no less than <a href="../sri-lanka">Colombo</a> and <a href="../yangon">Yangon</a>. Before colonization, Kolkata was a village, so everything was built from scratch in the 19th century. After the city lost its significance, everything began to collapse. Now here you can feel what life was like on the ruins of the Roman Empire one and a half thousand years ago.

The less solemn part of the city fell into severe decline. All buildings are in patches.

The particularly plight of Kolkata is connected with the history of the city: first, during the partition of India, Hindus fled here from the territory of Bangladesh (Muslim East Bengal), and then 20 years later, during the war for the independence of Bangladesh, a second stream of migrants came from Pakistan.

Maidan is a huge wasteland in the middle of the city. It’s hard to call it a park, because they don’t even really take care of the grass here. Locals picnic and play cards here, for lack of more suitable public spaces.

In Kolkata you can visit Mother Teresa's grave. This name is associated with charity, but it seems that everything is not clear cut. Even on Wikipedia, the “criticism” section is twice as long as the biography - it talks about the ineffective use of huge amounts of money, and about the insignificant scale of activity, artificially inflated by PR, and about low-quality medical care in shelters, which were essentially places where the dying were dumped, not trying to treat in a special way.

There are no auto rickshaws in Kolkata; instead, these old taxis are used.

City buses do not have numbers, but you can find your way by the signs, and in general the streets here are quite straight, you can ride until the first turn.

Kolkata is the only city in India where there are trams that have survived almost since the beginning of the 20th century.
<p/>

Travel by tram costs 5 rupees, even cheaper than by bus (7-8 rupees).

Opposite Kolkata across the river is the city of Howrah. By the way, photography is prohibited on the bridge.

Howrah is interesting because the main station is located here, also a colonial heritage.

From here, in a 2nd class carriage (2AC, the most expensive class of Indian trains I have been to), we go to Nepal.

<h2>Raxaul</h2>
<p>
A small town near the border with Nepal, to which I managed to snag a train ticket from Calcutta. Coming off the top-of-the-line second-class train I've ever traveled in India, I found myself at the very bottom: a small town on the outskirts of one of the poorest states in India (Bihar). Even tuk-tuks are rare here; passengers are greeted at the station by horse-drawn carriages.

There are also no paved roads here, except for the main route to Nepal; even from the station there is a dirt road.
