<h1>Georgia: Chiatura, Kutaisi, Tskaltubo</h1>
<i>23-25 June 2023</i>
<h2>Chiatura</h2>
<p>
The city of Chiatura in central Georgia is located somewhat away from the main routes, but tourists often come there to look at the local cable cars and scenic views. From Tbilisi you first need to get to the neighboring city of Sachkhere, and from there 10 kilometers by local minibus to Chiatura.

It had about 15 minutes to walk around this city.

<p>
Previously there was an intercity trolleybus line between Sachkhere and Chiatura, now there are only minibuses. Chiatura was originally a mining town, as manganese was mined here.

<p>
Arriving in Chiatura. The city is small and located in a river valley. The center is below, residential areas are on the surrounding hills.
<p/>

<p>
I read somewhere that in Soviet times there were 17 cable cars in Chiatura. On the Yandex map I counted 21. Almost like in <a href="../la-paz">La Paz</a>, although they were of course much shorter in length. For a long time, the cable cars were barely repaired, but still partially operational. Thanks to that people came to Chiatura for the experience of riding in a creaky, rusty cabin, similar to the pepelats from the “Kin-dza-dza” movie. It seems that this was possible back in 2019, but then renovations started, and now in the center of the city there is this brand new station:
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53038351928_a460b42608_h.jpg"/>
<p>
From here, cabins depart in three directions: to the south to the sanatorium and two to the west to residential areas.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53038257380_c608e8e7d7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is another cable car very close by, which goes in approximately the same direction as the sanatorium, but lower. It was not operating that day, although overall it looks new.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53038351918_be72f294ac_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Goes there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53037287792_dec98f5c62_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Not far from here, on the other side of the railway, you can see an abandoned cable car station.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53038257570_b917ec2e75_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The cabin is hanging.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53038052579_e6c028550f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Judging by the map, this cable car went to the same place (Mukhadze) as the new one, which was not working; perhaps the new one was built to replace this one, but not launched yet.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53038351868_27beb1b2cc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
If you cross the bridge over the river, you can see another cable car station, with two lines. This station is notable for the fact that it was the very first cable car in the entire USSR! Those who came to Chiatura before 2019 usually rode from here. Now this station is being revamped. The portraits of Lenin and Stalin are covered with plastic.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53037287757_669004fd9f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There were two lines from here - up this rock to the mines, and across the river.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53038351853_04246dadfc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The building in the distance on the mountain is the end of the cable car. The cable can be seen above the river if you look closely.
<p/>

<p>
And here are the other cables and you can see a little of the upper station near the mines.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53038351838_e2959bebc2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is another abandoned station next to the existing triple station across the river.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53038052394_99318844b9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Judging by the map, there were cable cars from here in two directions in approximately the same area in the west where two operating cable cars go.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53038257395_232e85a7a2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In total, I saw nine cable cars (working and non-working). The remaining 12 are not in the city center, most likely they are used to get to the mines.

<p>
After walking around the center, I went for a ride on the cable cars. A one-way fare is only 0.5 lari ($0.2). First I went to the sanatorium. Together with me there were some tourists who arrived on the same minibus (Russian-speaking and German-speaking), and a large group of locals with children.

The sanatorium at the top is a little abandoned, but there is a small amusement park.

<p>
Then I took the second cable car. There are two lines going west, I chose the one with the higher terminus so I could walk to the second terminus and return down the other line. This time I was the only tourist among the passengers. We go to the apartment buildings on the upper right.

<h2>Kutaisi</h2>
<p>
In 2014, I passed through Imereti (the central part of Georgia), without really seeing Kutaisi. This time I came here for a few days to fix that. Kutaisi has always been the second largest city in Georgia, but just recently it was overtaken by the ever-growing seaside resort Batumi.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53038361893_dc0d697011_h.jpg"/>

<p>
Kutaisi has a fairly large old quarter, somewhat less hilly than Tbilisi.
<p/>

Kutaisi Airport. There are fewer passengers in total than in Tbilisi, but for tourists it is probably even more useful, since cheap Wizz Air flights fly from here.

<h2>Tskaltubo</h2>
<p>
Near Kutaisi there is a resort town called Tskhaltubo (or Tskaltubo), famous for its abandoned sanatoriums. In Soviet times, people from all over the country came here because they got tour vouchers from their jobs. After independence they became empty, but now they are gradually coming back to life.
<p/>

<p>
There is a huge park in the middle of Tskaltubo, and sanatoriums along its perimeter.

It is not clear why, but it isn't used and isn't guarded at all, anyone can just waltz in.

Let's look at the remains of the interiors. The rooms in this sanatorium were not very large.

It looked like someone was running away in a hurry. But at the same time, I didn’t notice anyone living there now. But no one is looting either.

But the floors above are mostly inhabited by people who fled Abkhazia in 1993. Therefore, the front entrance is in good condition.

On a summer weekend there were a lot of people. It was a wise decision to lag behind the group (they go in every 15 minutes).

The last part of the cave can be navigated by boat. A ticket with a boat ride is about 50% more expensive. From the map hanging at the entrance, I thought that the footpath ran parallel to the boat's path, but in fact, on foot you immediately exit through a tunnel. So it makes sense to take a ticket with a boat ride.
