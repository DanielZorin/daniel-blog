<h2>Doha</h2>
<p>
I specifically bought a ticket with a long layover in Qatar so that I could sleep at night and fly the next day. Qatar is a convenient place for a layover, easy to get to the city, relatively inexpensive.

I booked a five-star hotel, which cost only about $40. I think it was the first time in my life that I stayed in a five-star hotel at my own expense.

The New Doha metro station, I stayed here on my first trip to Qatar.

There are large administrative buildings near the metro that look like palaces.

It turns out that the Doha metro does not work on Fridays in the morning (until 2 p.m.). It used to be like that in Dubai (it definitely was on my first trip in 2011). I had to take a taxi to the airport, fortunately it was cheap - about $5 (two metro tickets cost $3).
