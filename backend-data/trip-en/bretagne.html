<h1>France: Mont Saint-Michel, Rennes, Brest, Quimper, Nantes</h1>
<i>4-7 April 2024</i>
<h2>Mont Saint-Michel</h2>
<p>
I’ve been to France 8 times, but there was still something missing: it seems like I’ve been to almost all regions, but it was like one city in each. On my new journey, I first headed to the west coast, to Brittany (the only region on the mainland I had not been to) and further south. First of all, I stopped by Mont Saint-Michel - one of the most famous attractions in France. Although it is a very famous place, it is quite difficult to get there. The nearest major city is Rennes (the capital of Brittany). From there there is a bus three times a day, twice in the morning and once in the evening, and back once in the morning and twice in the evening. There are also buses from the nearest railway station Pontorson, 4 times a day, and trains from Pontorson run less frequently (but the bus is coordinated with them). And all this is only on weekdays, and not in winter. At the same time, there are a huge number of tourists there, apparently 99% come by tour buses (considering the prices of trains in France, taking an excursion can be cheaper, although it’s a bit far from Paris).
<p/>

<p>
Mont Saint-Michel is located on a small island, and long-distance buses go to the mainland; then you need to walk about 30 minutes along a long bridge. You cannot cross this bridge by car; you must also park on the mainland. Only buses to Pontorson arrive on the island itself. If you don't want to walk, you can also take a shuttle bus.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53653249574_8286945616_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is nothing particularly interesting on the mainland, cafes, shops, hotels.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53653362135_089acd6e71_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is what the shuttle looks like. It has a steering wheel on both sides, the driver just gets out, sits on the other side, and drives back. Although, in principle, there is a place where you can turn around.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53652029437_29a98c57d1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are strong tides here and at high tide the bridge can flood, so the island becomes isolated and there are no buses. But this happens somewhere at night; during the day the bridge works.

<p>
At low tide you can see the seabed - this is such quick mud. It is not safe to walk there, although the guides somehow lead groups of people through.
<p/>

So, Mont Saint-Michel.

<p>
This is a very small town, population is 33 people. The main street leads up to the abbey.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53653362095_73f6141996_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are all sorts of restaurants and souvenir shops. On excursions, children are dressed in workers' overalls.

In addition to the main street, there are several side streets with almost no people. Sometimes you can stumble upon the view down.
<p/>

<p>
There is also a cemetery hidden in the alleys.

<p>
I'm heading inside. Entrance costs 13 euros. There are three queues - for groups, for those who have purchased tickets in advance, and for others. The first line stretched from the beginning of the stairs, and without a ticket I simply walked past it straight to the ticket office.

I went to the supermarket. Oddly enough, I felt that prices in France had not increased much, unlike in Germany.

I went to a restaurant to try all sorts of exotic things. This is foie gras (fatty goose liver), I've never tried it before. In general, I hate chicken liver, I can’t stand it either boiled or fried, it’s a rare type of food that just makes me sick. I don’t really like pates either. Foie gras, in principle, turned out to be quite tasty, it felt like delicate ice cream, but not sweet. It doesn't taste like liver at all.

Rennes has two full-fledged metro lines. Before the advent of the metro in <a href="../bern">Lausanne</a>, Rennes was the smallest city in the world with a metro.

In France, there are no lockers at train stations, but now there is a website where you can offer your services in this area. Mostly the storages are in hotels that can now make extra money by storing the luggage of non-guests.

<h2>Brest</h2>
<p>
I have already been to the city of Brest <a href="../brest">in Belarus</a> - a rare case when two cities with the same name are located in countries with different languages, and one is not named after the other. Brest is the capital of a department called Finistère (obviously from the Latin "end of the world").
<p/>

In the very center, a stone's throw from the town hall. The town hall here is unusually modern. At the entrance there is a black and white striped flag - the flag of Brittany.

Curiously, everything below, directly next to the river, is military territory; you can’t go there. Not just near the castle, but also far inland along the river. But you can walk along the bridge and ordinary areas and look from above.

Quimper is also located at the “end of the earth” in Brittany, south of Brest. The old city is much better preserved here.

<h2>Nantes</h2>
<p>
The city of Nantes was the historical capital of Brittany, but now belongs to a different region (Pays de la Loire). But the castle of the Dukes of Brittany is located right here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53652072422_dbe6da7bdc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The castle is in the middle of the city, and surrounded by a moat, unusual.

Still, this one is the oldest. By the way, it was on this square that on September 5, 1661, the lieutenant of the musketeers Charles de Batz, the Chevalier d'Artagnan, arrested the Minister of Finance Nicolas Fouquet. This is one of the few episodes from the biography of the real d'Artagnan, described in Dumas' novel (although there this event was moved to another place in Nantes).

In the center of Nantes there is also an ugly tower from the 70s. Previously, you could go upstairs to the observation deck, but now the entire building is abandoned.
