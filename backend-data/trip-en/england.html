<h1>United Kingdom: Salisbury, Southampton, Birmingham, Cardiff, Bath, Bristol</h1>
<i>20-24 August 2019</i>
<h2>Salisbury</h2>
<p>
As a decent Russian tourist, when I arrived in England, the first thing I did was go to look at the spires in Salisbury. <i>A Russian defector who escaped to the UK and lived in Salisbury was poisoned in 2018 with Novichok poison. Two Russian agents were caught on cameras in London, Salisbury and on the train. After that there was an interview on Russian TV with them, where the two guys ridiculously explained that they were just tourists who wanted to see the spire of Salisbury cathedral, so they came to the UK for 1 day just for that. They also rented a very cheap hotel room with one bed, so there were a lot of gay jokes about "spires" after that interview.</i>

<p>
All thoughts are only about the spire...
<p/>

<p>
Seriously, the cathedral is worth a look, it’s Gothic from the 13th century. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to go inside - it closes early.

In fact, most tourists (and there are quite a few of them) come to Salisbury not for the spire, but for Stonehenge, which can undoubtedly be called one of the most famous attractions in England. There are regular tourist buses from the station to Stonehenge. More precisely, first a bus takes you to the tourist center, and from there there is a small shuttle to the monument itself.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256469425_aff53ca4b9_o.jpg">
<p>
Stonehenge is also often on the list of the most disappointing attractions. On the other hand, what can you expect?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255628968_3c35951ee4_o.jpg">
<p>
Since there are a lot of people, it is impossible to get close to Stonehenge.

Interestingly, around Stonehenge there are ordinary fields and pastures. In principle, it should be quite easy to sneak through without a ticket if you wanted to.

In the middle between Stonehenge and Salisbury are the remains of the ancient Roman city of Sarum - the predecessor of present-day Salisbury. From the outside it looks like a hill.

<h2>Southampton</h2>
<p>
I spent the night in this city before flying to the islands of Guernsey and Jersey from the local airport. There wasn’t much time to explore the city - in the evening I didn’t have enough energy that I fell asleep on the train and rode past Southampton (I had to get off at the next station and ride back), and the streets were a bit empty in the evening, so I only walked around in the morning in the center. Southampton was an important port and it was heavily bombed by the Germans during the war, almost nothing of the old remains. Here are just the city gates.

<h2>Birmingham</h2>
<p>
Birmingham is the UK's second most populous city, but it's not a place where you'll find many tourists. This is an industrial city that also suffered from the Second World War. I flew into Birmingham Airport from <a href="../jersey">Jersey</a>.
<p/>

I spent the night in the city and left for Cardiff the next day. There was a lot of time, however, I overslept due to the alarm clock not going off, and therefore only had time to see the city center.

<h2>Cardiff</h2>
<p>
Cardiff is the capital of Wales, one of the four constituent parts of Great Britain. Unlike Scotland, which was independent for a long time, and after unification was perceived as a separate state with a common king with England, Wales was annexed already in the 13th century. On the other hand, the local language has been preserved significantly better than Scottish: 20% of the residents of Wales know Welsh (only 1% know Scottish in Scotland). Wales has no particularly famous landmarks, and outside the kingdom it is remembered mainly in connection with the football championships, where teams from all parts of the UK are separate.
<p/>

Welsh is an unusual language and boasts tricky spelling, much like Irish.

A couple of kilometers from the city center is the port of Cardiff - there is a stadium, the Welsh Parliament and an entire amusement park.

A typical English traffic light for pedestrians with a button. It is very unusual that often the traffic light is not on the opposite side of the street, as usual, but exactly above the button, sometimes also at 90 degrees to the roadway.

<h2>Bath</h2>

The ancient city of Bath in the west of England is included in the UNESCO list. It was founded in the Roman era on hot springs, hence the name.

<h2>Bristol</h2>
<p>
Bristol is a port city in the west of England. For some reason, in Russia they like to name shops and hotels after it, so even if you enter “Bristol” in Russian into Google, the first link will be to a chain of alcohol stores (interestingly, in England the order of results in Google is different, and the Wikipedia article about the city comes first).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256159793_b4f02d860c_o.jpg">

<p>
Bristol Castle was destroyed in the 17th century; now its remains can be seen in a large park in the city center.

Fish market. Although Bristol is a port, it is not located by the sea, but by the river bank, shortly before it flows into the sea.

On the outskirts of Bristol is Clifton Bridge, one of the largest suspension bridges of the 19th century.

The bridge is located in a very picturesque place - the Avon River here forms a deep gorge, so there are steep cliffs on both sides of the bridge.
