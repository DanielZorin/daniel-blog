<h1>Thailand: Bangkok</h1>
<i>15-18 April 2023</i>
<h2>Bangkok</h2>
<p>
I have never been to Thailand in April, and because of this I have not seen the Thai New Year - Songkran. So, when I was choosing when to fly from Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok, I took a ticket for April 15 - to capture the last day of this holiday.
<p/>

<p>
Having arrived in the morning, I went from the airport by bus directly to Khao San Road. I booked the hotel in the side streets between Khaosan and the river, so I had to go right through it. But already in the morning the Khaosan area was partially blocked.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52911955683_7b7c0a53dc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
So I went around the nearby Rambutri Street. The place looked unusual, since all the shops were closed.
<p/>

<p>

<p/>

<p>
While walking, I was doused with water several times. This is actually the main feature of the Thai New Year - pouring water on each other.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52911955658_ca64d4033a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Water pistols and cannons are sold everywhere.
<p/>

<p>
But those who water from buckets are much more dangerous, because the volume of water falling on you is incomparable.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52911955648_519268b817_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Having checked into the hotel, I returned to the street and carefully filmed what was happening from the edge.

<p>
In addition to water, the locals smear their faces with some kind of white substance, it seems to be talc, which the people of Myanmar use to smear their cheeks every day.
<p/>

<p>
In general, it’s fun if you want to participate, but if you need to go to the grocery store or buy a SIM card, a bucket of water poured on your head is not always relevant. Therefore, one can understand expats who are trying to leave during Songkran - they are already fed up with it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52911650414_96b58e753e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Well, I left the camera at the hotel, took only my wallet and phone in a waterproof case, and went into the thick of things.

Finally, Khao San Road itself.

Everyone dances to the music as usual, but with water.

<p>
Surprisingly, the food vendors continue to prepare pad thai as if nothing is happening.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52911899045_681f4f899c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On the way out I was soaking wet, as if I had jumped into a pool with my clothes on.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52911512856_c1b3f7b635_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Luckily, it’s hot in Thailand, so after an hour of walking around the old town I was already more or less dry. In general, outside of a few streets, such as Khao San, there is not much active watering, mainly cars and minibuses.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52911970108_ba9ce204cd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the evening there was already less water (ran out?), but there was only more talc, especially as it flowed onto the ground.

I have long wanted to go to the famous Thai market on the railway tracks, and only pulled myself together during my seventh time in Bangkok. This place is located in the city of Samut Songkhran, which is a distant suburb of Bangkok. Usually tourists are taken there as part of an excursion by bus, but I wanted to get there on my own on the same train, which is a little more tricky.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52910937672_e0394305ec_h.jpg"/>

<p>
First we go to the western part of Bangkok.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52911969988_e5f5257937_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I have never been on this street before.

<p>
Wongwian Yai station, the journey starts from here. The station is not connected in any way to Thailand's main rail network and there is only one line from here to Maha Chai Station.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52911512696_212b8fa715_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The trip costs 10 baht (as usual, trains in Thailand are very cheap). Trains run quite often, every hour or so.
<p/>

<p>
The inside is a typical Thai commuter train.

<p/>

<p>
The ride is about an hour.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52911969893_1c0aea617f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Canals constantly run along the road, and various bridges are built from houses to the railway.

<p>
Maha Chai Station. This is the city of Samut Sakhon in the small province of the same name; in everyday life it is called Maha Chai after the name of the station.
<p/>

<p>
The station has a market, but not the one I need. I need to hurry, because the next train leaves in just 20 minutes, and in order to catch it, you need to cross to the other side of the river.

Ban Laem Station. From here starts the second part of the route, also a completely isolated Ban Laem - Mae Klong railway. The fare again is 10 baht, and the ride is also an hour. But here the train only leaves four times a day, so you need to look at the schedule so as not to wait too long.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52911969673_6086342f8a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Let's go. There weren't many passengers on the train, and there were a few tourists.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52911969658_8d0454a8ca_h.jpg"/>

The second part of the path is much less populated and mainly passes through fields.

The Khao San Street area has changed a lot since the pandemic. There are already quite a lot of tourists, but many businesses have not survived two years of closure - many of the back and side streets are empty. There are more European-style restaurants and fewer food carts, as if Khao San has matured and become more posh.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52911884685_a1bc6d3b33_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I didn’t immediately realize that the number of 7-11 stores had sharply decreased. Previously, on Khaosan alone there were 5 or 6 of them, but now in this entire area there are only 3 or 4. In principle, the density of 7-11 has become average like elsewhere in the city, apparently because there have been no tourists for two years, creating increased demand in this place.
<p/>

<p>
I can’t say exactly how much more expensive hotels have become, since the New Year period is not indicative.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52911970083_11a6ad0ac1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Even on Khao San, dealers of counterfeit documents have completely disappeared, and souvenirs have become more serious - there are no more T-shirts and bracelets with vulgar inscriptions, even with the 7-11 logo was hard to find.

But instead of 7-11, a bunch of marijuana stores opened.

Yes, in the same Thailand where just a couple of years ago you could get the death penalty for weed, you can now buy it in a store.
