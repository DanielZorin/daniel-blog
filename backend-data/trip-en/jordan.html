<h1>Jordan: Aqaba, Petra, Wadi Rum, Amman, Jerash, Madaba</h1>
<i>9-14 January 2014</i>
<h2>Aqaba</h2>
<p>
Aqaba is a town at the junction of the borders of Egypt, Israel and Jordan and the only Jordanian resort. There's not much to do there other than lying on the beach, but Aqaba is much cheaper than Eilat and there's more to see nearby than in Taba. It’s a very long drive from Taba to Cairo, while Petra and Wadi Rum are close to Aqaba, so Aqaba can be used as a transit point.

<p>
Of the attractions here, there is a ruined fortress.

The destroyed church. It is touted as the first Christian church in history.

<p>
The Arab Revolt flag is one piece. The flag is huge and clearly visible from Eilat. The flag was used during the uprising against the Ottoman Empire in the First World War, then the flags of modern Jordan, Palestine, Syria and the United Arab Emirates were created on its basis.

<p>
The tourists on the beach are mostly local. Egypt is visible in the distance.

<p>
Street signs in Aqaba are large and informative.

<p>
The bazaar occupies half the city.
<p/>

<p>
The advertisements look concise. The numbers are written with both Arabic and European digits.

Something like this.

<h2>Petra</h2>
<p>
Petra is one of the new "Seven Wonders of the World", the fourth I have seen (after the Great Wall of China, the Colosseum and the Statue of Jesus in <a href="../rio-de-janeiro">Rio de Janeiro </a>). Of course, this status a priori means that the number of tourists here is off the charts. One can argue where the cause is and where the effect is, but one thing is indisputable - popularity was to the detriment of Petra more than any other “wonder of the world.”
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257679335_df932e87e9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Let's start with prices. Petra is the most expensive tourist attraction in the world. Entrance costs 50 euros (the Jordanian dinar is approximately equal to a euro), and for those coming on a day trip - 90 euros. Yes, it’s a wonder of the world, all things considered, but shouldn't there be a limit? Now, if the entrance cost, say, 500 or 5000 euros, would you also say that it's worth it? In my opinion, it is clearly not worth fifty. Even without touching on the aesthetic characteristics of Petra, it is obvious that the money is going somewhere in the wrong place, namely, int someone's pocket rather than on maintaining the museum. There is nothing special to support there; it has stood for thousands of years and has not fallen apart. With the money for tickets, it would be possible, for example, to create at least some infrastructure, or at least provide transportation for tourists around the park.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256636876_45cbdd3851_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here we come to another phenomenon. Even 50 years ago, when Petra was not a tourist attraction, people lived right in houses carved into the rock.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255908442_e1e4f92ed8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
When Petra was opened to tourists, all the residents were evicted, and now the houses look bare and lifeless.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257679355_1a446bcce2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
People were relocated to the city of Wadi Musa, which was essentially built from scratch.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257679190_f90ca1b66f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
By the way, Wadi Musa is so called because there is a place nearby where the prophet Moses (Musa) carved water out of the rock.
<p/>

<p>
The break from their usual lifestyle has spoiled people.
<p/>

<p>
Mister, donkey five dinar! Donkey Taxi, Mister! Only five dinar! It's annoying. You will say that this is an Arab country, here it is in the order of things. I have been to a lot of Arab and other eastern countries, and I know the difference between friendliness and harassment. Even within Jordan itself, in other places they may offer you to buy something once, but they will not follow you for half an hour, offering their “services”.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256636801_a46d5454e4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I must say that before I saw everything with my own eyes, I could hardly imagine what Petra was. If you try to Google images, 99% of the times this place will be shown.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256080192_9c9d5716d3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is, of course, a good place, but not the only one. In general, there is another similar building carved into the rock in Petra...
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255908622_2c7549d984_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It is located in the far end, however, there is nothing inside.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257679625_e86c30a3c8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are about five other similar mausoleums, which I was already too lazy to climb to.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257679700_a77fd07f7b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And also many small houses in the rock. All this is now empty, and with the transformation into a museum it has lost its originality.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257679430_10986c451e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It seems that many tourists do not go beyond the main mausoleum at all, which is why 99% of descriptions of Petra end there. When I left closer to four o'clock (Petra was closing soon), I came across excursion groups coming towards me, that is, those who had just arrived!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257383619_7d55627053_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I think now Petra is more of a natural landmark than a man-made one. The valley and rocks are very nice. The best decision in Petra would be to follow the paths leading up the rocks.

<h2>Wadi Rum</h2>
<p>
The Valley of the Moon (Wadi Rum) is located in the south of Jordan. In my opinion, this place is no less worthy of a visit than Petra. The landscape is similar, only here there is more distance between the rocks, and bright orange sand lies in the valleys.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257199189_c9e59e0ece_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You can ride on the sand as if you were on snow.

<p>
In some places there are traces of the life of ancient people in the rocks. For example, the foundation of the Nabatean temple (the same people that built Petra).

<h2>Amman</h2>
<p>
Amman is an empty city. It looks cool from a distance, but when you look up close, you won’t see anything.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256559749_dd66fa698f_h.jpg"/>

<p>
They haven’t yet thought of charging 50 euros for entry to the Roman amphitheater; they only charge 1.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255082297_c834fb0e93_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Amman looks cool because it's on the hills.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256013478_1b4495940b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Up close there are endless crowds of cars...
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256559989_6ba2eb6d81_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Garbage...
<p/>

<p>
More trash...
<p/>

<p>
And further...

Portraits of kings...

<p>
Monuments...
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255082512_b7c2a2fb36_h.jpg"/>

Some nooks and crannies...
<p/>

More nooks and crannies...
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256013723_bd262c87f8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Signs to nooks and crannies that are very difficult to navigate because there are no proper maps.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255811166_4e48e63230_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But Amman has two advantages. Firstly, there are cheap hotels and very cheap restaurants. Here is a cheap establishment where the king frequents, his photographs hang on the walls.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256855580_1a5f864667_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Secondly, the people here are the nicest, not spoiled by tourists.

<p>
In general, public transport in Jordan is terrible; tourists cannot use it. There is basically no information about routes, and it is useless to ask locals - they will send you by taxi.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255811281_9d5e192573_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The only transport route between Israel and Jordan is the Amman-Nazareth bus from Nazarene Tours. You can find a phone number on the Internet and call to find out what days it operates. Finding the place where the buses leave was not easy, but the directions on the Internet were correct. There are two hotels in Amman with similar names: Le Royal and Royal. The first is five-star in the very center, the second is cheap and on the outskirts. You need to find a taxi driver who knows about the second one, and it’s done.
<p/>

<h2>Jerash</h2>
<p>
The funniest thing in Jerash was when I asked the cop where the minibuses going to Amman stopped, and he started telling me that there were only taxis, despite the fact that I arrived by minibus, and the stop was 50 meters away.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256976614_97077fceaf_h.jpg"/>

<p>
From afar, Jerash looks exactly like Amman.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255498642_67234e2224_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are Roman ruins here too, only there are many more of them.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256427503_51901d62d8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In fact, an entire city has been preserved here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255498997_c38e4a4e88_h.jpg"/>
<p>
From it you can evaluate how small towns were at that time.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256427723_3cbfa07ba7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is one main street.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255498717_185acc3c6b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Main square. There is another one at the other end, but it has not been fully excavated.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256976514_a2d466a10c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Lanes branch off from it, passing between residential buildings or temples. In total, several thousand people lived here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256427763_3f1b92671a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And then the goats graze.

<p>
For some reason, only columns remained from the old buildings. Perhaps the walls were made of wood?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255498917_e81e4005a7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A city of only columns looking into nowhere looks funny.

<h2>Madaba</h2>
<p>
Now I know what inspired the creators of the unforgettable Neon Genesis Evangelion (besides drugs). This is Mount Nebo, south of Amman, from where Moses first saw Israel. In honor of this there is a breathtaking cross.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256052787_8f50876358_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The Promised Land doesn't look very attractive from here.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257442195_c60a116d41_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The nearby town of Madaba has the oldest map of Israel (6th century).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256598033_8775168169_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It is neatly fenced with chains.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257146229_7e438acdac_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Apart from this, there is nothing much in Madaba.
<p/>

<p>
At the entrance to the city there is an airplane, probably donated at one time by the Soviet Union for the holy struggle with Israel.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255670007_49103dd6e3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Well, there are also interesting banners here - they are written by hand.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256400236_be172129e4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Near Madaba is the Jordanian coast of the Dead Sea. Compared to Israel, there are almost no tourists here, and hotel prices are absolutely outrageous. Needless to say, you can’t get here by public transport.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255321907_c2532832e9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Entrance to the beach costs 20 (!) euros. In my opinion, this is outrageous, even worse then in Petra.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256051366_88e245af10_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The funny thing is that if you walk 20 meters to the neighboring beach, then the entrance there will be “only” 11 euros. And if you walk a little further, you can approach the shore for free, although you won’t be able to swim - there’s no one.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255322022_09c1f162e4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Where there is no beach, there is no sand, so you can recognize the natural appearance of the Dead Sea.
