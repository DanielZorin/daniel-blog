<h1>Philippines: Manila, Mindoro, Banaue, Baguio, Angeles</h1>

<h2>Manila</h2>
<p>
Manila is a city where you can have a look but won't find any reason to stay long. You can look at the enchanting stinking garbage dump in the tropics. Manila is a city you will hate even if you are in transit there. I've been to Manila four times. By the fourth, I could no longer think of anything good to say about this city.
<p/>

<p>
Immediately upon arrival in Manila, the visitor is greeted by the local incredibly convenient transport system. Well, at least it exists, which is not bad. But for a city that is twice the size of Moscow, it is a little lacking. The airport consists of several terminals that face each other with their backs. If you fly with different airlines from different terminals, you will have to take a taxi to travel between them. In traffic, yes. All the roads around the airport are simply clogged with traffic jams, more so than the roads in the city center. There is no transport at the airport itself, because the bus is such a tricky thing. You need to take a road without a sidewalk to a highway where jeepneys are driving in a traffic jam at a speed of 5 km/h. Oh jeepney!
<p/>

<p>
All tourists in their reports talk about jeepneys with such aspiration: look, this is a unique transport! Look how brightly colored they are! Look, no two are alike! It’s good to admire jeepneys from the window of an air-conditioned taxi, but go try to use them for their intended purpose.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256422811_a76c0549b9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I understand that Filipinos are not usually very tall, but even they have to crawl into a jeepney while bending over. Russian gazelles and Thai songthaews will seem like a very humane form of transport.
<p/>

<p>
The anarchy is so strong that the jeepneys don’t even have numbers, which is nonsense for such a big city with hundreds of different routes. At least the jeepneys have signs in English, so if you know the names of the main streets, you can figure out where to board.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256622383_872b74f99d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Manila also has a subway. Rumors about terrible crowds are somewhat exaggerated - I have never been in such a situation that it was even close to what is happening in Moscow on Vykhino in the morning. The metro costs about twice as much as a jeepney (20-30 pesos versus 10-15), but it is much more convenient than being stuck in traffic. Perhaps the most reliable way to get to the airport is to take the metro to the terminal, and from there take a jeepney/taxi/bicycle taxi. If you need to go to the third terminal (from where Cebu Pacific domestic flights fly), you can take a bicycle taxi through the huge slums surrounding the metro station to the intersection with the highway, and from there on foot. It is better to get to the fourth (main terminal) by jeepney, but you still need to get to the jeepney parking lot. In short, this is not Rio de Janeiro.
<p/>

<p>
Probably, if you have a short vacation, it’s easier to spend money and get stuck in traffic jams by taking a taxi. At least you can sleep in it. All taxis in Manila have "May reklamo ka?" written on them. There don't seem to be many people willing to advertise on taxis.

<p>
For Filipinos, it seems that Manila is a city of great opportunities. But I don't understand them. Living conditions in the village, of course, are not very good, but they are better than living in slums. And judging by the number of slums, most of those who come in large numbers end up there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255693692_3bd708b8d2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The quality of "housing" in these slums is very poor.

<p>
There are a lot of children in Manila, they run around in flocks. The slum dwellers don't seem to bother going to school. Many don’t even have any documents.

There are many slums around the world, but only in Manila can you see such a phenomenon as living on a cardboard with an entire family with small children.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255693882_556eea4843_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The cardboard can be thrown anywhere, even on a busy street with several lanes of traffic.

<p>
Do you think I ran all over the city looking for slums? Nothing like this. I was actually in a very small part of Manila. The layout of the city is something like this. There is a sea (a bay to be more precise), the garbage river from the title photo flows into it. South of the mouth is the old city built by the Spanish, Intramuros, Manila's main attraction. Further along the coast there is the main square with a large park, and then the Ermita area between the embankment and the large avenue, over which the metro runs. I was also north of Intramuros, where there is a big market, and also in various outskirts near the airport and bus stations, plus in the dirty, squalid areas around these stations. That's all. There is no need to go anywhere, the most colorful slums are located in the old city, film as much as you want.

The market offers an assortment according to the clientele. You need to look for anything more expensive than 1 dollar (45 pesos).

Since the vast majority of tourists in the Philippines do not go beyond their beach resort, located on a small island far from the cities, the tourism infrastructure here is, to put it mildly, not very good. There are problems with hotels - the cheapest room costs at least 700 pesos ($16), and that’s even without air conditioning. You still need to look for it, there are only two such places. For locals, there are dormitories at a budget price of around 100-200 pesos with rooms for 20 people, but this is if you want to not just feel the bottom, but dig even lower. On the other hand, since there are no tourists, the locals are not trying to get rich at your expense, so they won’t cheat you anywhere, they won’t charge you double the price in a jeepney, or they won’t try to scam you.
<p/>

<p>
Despite extreme poverty, Manila cannot be called a dangerous city. The main danger here is stepping into a deep muddy puddle.
<p/>

The life of a wealthy person in Manila will consist of standing in traffic jams and going to large shopping centers, because this is the only way to more or less protect yourself from trash and frenzy. Yes, and don’t take intercity buses. By the way, in Manila they haven’t even reached the point of creating a bus station; there are a bunch of small offices of transport companies in different areas of the city. You can also play a leisurely round of golf under the walls of the old city.

And look at the monument to a man named Lapu-Lapu, who fought the Spanish colonists when they first appeared. The Philippines was a Spanish colony for about 300 years, before Spain lost the war with the United States in 1898. On the main square, in addition to the Lapu-Lapu monument, there is a whole alley of busts of various rebels, each of which has a caption about “occupiers”. On the contrary, Americans in the Philippines are treated very well because they liberated them from Japanese occupation and maintain several military bases that boost the Philippine economy.

The phenomenon of guest workers in the Philippines is on a grand scale. The fact is that most Filipinos speak English well: the country was a colony of the United States, plus English is the language for communication between numerous peoples from different islands. Filipinos have a specific accent, in particular they like the sound [a] in place of the letter A instead of the American [e], but it is much more understandable than the Indian accent. It turns out that the Philippines is the cheapest of the English-speaking countries, so the demand for workers is high.
By the way, citizens of the Philippines, in order to leave the country, need either a “permit to leave to work” or a return ticket (for tourists). If they suspect that you want to escape, they may not let you out.

In the Philippines, local government is surprisingly close to the people. In each "barangay" (this is the smallest administrative unit - a village, or in the case of Manila, one block) there are long lists with the names of local officials or even graffiti. Do you know at least one person from the government in your area?

<h2>Mindoro</h2>
<p>
All Philippine resorts are located very far from civilization (unlike, for example, in Russia or China, where the beaches are usually in the city). You need to fly somewhere, then take a bus, then a ferry, then another motorcycle taxi. On the one hand, tourists do not see the poverty and squalor that make up large cities. On the other hand, this means problems with infrastructure: an extremely poor selection of goods in stores, a lack of parties and nightlife, you won’t be able to go anywhere much from the island; in less advanced places, even electricity may not be available around the clock. Suitable for retirees and those who want to escape from civilization for a week and snorkel, but these places are not comfortable for living.
The closest resort to Manila is called Puerto Galera and is located on the island of Mindoro. You first need to take a bus to Batangas city (about two hours), then an hour by ferry.
<p/>

I was never afraid of flying on airplanes, but sailing on this boat was really scary, it felt like a roller coaster when it was jumping on the waves. I arrived to Mindoro all green from the motions.

<p>
Puerto Galera is not essentially a city, it is several villages on a fairly large coastal area, among which there is a main one, which the locals call “Poblacion” (in Spanish this means “settled area”), and tourists usually live in the village of San Isidro, better known as White Beach. Apart from this resort area, the rest of the island of Mindoro (and it is quite large) is little developed and practically uninhabited. Life exists almost only on the coast; inside there is an impenetrable jungle. The road around the island is interrupted for a couple of tens of kilometers just at Puerto Galera, so you can only go in one direction.

Port. Upon entry, tourists are charged a so-called environmental fee of approximately two dollars. A common practice is - don’t feed the Filipinos bread, give them some nice pieces of paper, the more the better.
<p/>

<p>
We initially settled in the "town", it is within walking distance of the ferry terminal. The city has a more or less large supermarket and several food outlets with typical Filipino food like fried chicken. Few hotels - the only one with reasonable price costs more than $17, and the quality is very low - wooden walls with holes, geckos, no shower (you can only shower with cold water from a ladle), no internet. But there is air conditioning.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255939772_02deaed0c6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The beach in the city is also not very conducive to swimming.

Well, it doesn’t look like “paradise” at all.

If you pass through some hotel on a hill and go down the slope, you can get to a fairly secluded beach.

<p>
Here the sand and water are clean, although it is difficult to enter the water, because it is full of sharp stones and algae.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257414809_c3ec0b91f4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A day later we went from there to White Beach. Transport in the villages is represented by the same jeepneys and tricycles. Jeepneys go long distances (to the nearest big city 50 km to the east) and very rarely, so it’s realistic to travel on tricycles. All tricyclists have a sign with prices from anywhere to anywhere, prices start from 15 pesos ($0.33). It costs 25 pesos to White Beach, and 30 pesos to the next village of Aninuan. These are prices per person, that is, if there are two of you, then each pays 30, which is strange for a taxi. Tricyclists who stand near hotels, especially expensive ones, demand more money, so the safest thing to do is to catch someone passing along the road, since there are plenty of them.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257710545_ef32f6682a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Locals ride tricycles in groups of ten.

The White beach looks much nicer.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256667901_cd90c34075_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are a number of restaurants and shops along the beach, followed by residential buildings.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257414874_bdd1f2f249_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The streets are very narrow, everything is densely built up with hotels.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257414859_0476b25179_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The housing here is of decent quality, but also not cheap - about 1000 pesos (more than $20).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257710620_a0746dd139_h.jpg"/>
<p>
As a result, we settled in this great place for $25 (1100 pesos). There is a private pool - much better than the sea with nasty salt water. There is also Wi-fi, but only in the main building.

<p>
Another small disadvantage is that to buy something, you need to go to White Beach, and for this you need to go up and down the hill.
<p/>

<p>
In terms of the range of shops and restaurants, White Beach is not abundant, but there are several normal places. Right on the beach, everywhere the food is dull and expensive, but there is cheap and tasty ice cream. There is one place further away with good pizza; on the main street they do barbecue in the evening next to the pawnshop. I wonder why there is a pawn shop in every village in the Philippines? Well, like in <a href="../mongolia">Mongolia</a>.

A stall with typical Filipino food. Big Mac, yeah. But a real Big Mac, let me tell you, is a much healthier food.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257415604_2ab7fe3d3b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Prices are very low - burgers from $0.25. It's easy to eat, but it's the most unhealthy food in the world. The amount of palm oil and mayonnaise is simply over the top.

Although life here is not very good, there are a number of European and American retirees here. Some even run restaurants. If you only need a beach holiday, and the idea of eating European food in a hotel restaurant at European prices doesn’t bother you, then everything is fine. The sunsets are amazing.

As I said, there's not much to see in this village. You can take a motorcycle and go to the neighboring one, but there is unlikely to be anything new there. It takes several hours to get to Manila. You can also sail directly to the famous Boracay island if you go to the city on the other side of the island. You can also take a walk around the surrounding area. Here is a list of attractions.

You won’t be able to climb the mountains without preparation. It is quite possible to walk to the waterfalls.
<p/>

The first waterfall is not impressive.

The second one is better.

There are almost no hotels in this part; you can find completely secluded places on the beach.

<h2>Banaue</h2>
<p>
Banaue is the most beautiful place in the Philippines. From Manila you can take an overnight bus, the ticket costs about $10. In the morning you find yourself in a divine place, where, firstly, there is an excellent climate - there is no heat and humidity, and secondly, it is inexpensive - a good hotel costs $10. And there is something to see.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255147072_e3c63521cb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The town of Banaue is very small. Here is the central square.

That's not all. Nearby there is the village of Batad, also with terraces, but made from stone. Batad is 30 kilometers away and can only be reached by tricycle taxi. There is also a jeepney, only a little cheaper, but it runs once a day - in the morning from Batad, and back in the evening (so that residents of Batad can go to Banaue to work), that is, you can only come by jeepney for an overnight stay. Taxis take you to a place called Saddle point - the top of the pass. The jeepneys travel further down the road.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256625584_62a0ef12de_h.jpg"/>

The rest of the road is approximately the same, only on foot.

The locals run here very cheerfully, but in general the path is narrow and the stones are crooked.

<h2>Baguio</h2>
<p>
If you don’t want to leave Banaue at night, then the only alternative is a morning minibus to the city of Baguio, halfway to Manila. Six hours on hellish serpentines is a serious ordeal. Hotels in Baguio are bad again. The cheapest one cost almost $20, the room was normal (only there was no outlet, we had to run an extension cord from the hallway), the Internet worked well for once, but the shower/toilet on the floor was crap, like at a train station. The bonus included an animal corner where two snakes lived.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255860956_014b2f1370_h.jpg"/>
<p>
For two days, the green snake did not move a millimeter from its place.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256062578_ed8d67d53c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
When you approach Baguio, the city looks very picturesque - colorful houses on the hills, just like in Mexico. Disappointment awaits you inside, especially if the weather lets you down.
<p/>

In the most literal sense.

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256609754_2cbb655914_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Since it was raining and there wasn’t much to see in Baguio, we spent most of our time in the shopping center, fortunately there is one here and it’s quite large. By the way, in the Philippines absolutely everywhere food portions are very small, so the low price at first glance is somewhat deceptive. Even the instant noodles here are half the size of the Chinese equivalents.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255132277_1039de7109_h.jpg"/>

And the view from the roof of the shopping center would have been nice if the sun had not disappeared behind the clouds.

<h2>Angeles</h2>
<p>
The crystal dream of many Filipinos is to get out of the Philippines. It is traditionally easier for women to do this, because for them there is the option of emigration through marriage. To bring the dreams of ordinary Filipino girls closer to reality, there is the city of Angeles, the purpose of which was originally to serve the nearby American military base. Now, aging soldiers continue to hang out in the familiar places in pleasant company.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255089312_d1a557c7b0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In Russia they say that the homeland begins with cigarettes sold by piece. I don’t know if the Philippines has the same underground culture as in Russia (there was at least one revolution there), but individual cigarettes are also not alien to the Philippine homeland. 3 pesos (5 rubles).
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255818641_26371c2a4f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
For special connoisseurs there are also two.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255089112_3c315172ea_h.jpg"/>
<p>
As a city, Angeles is pretty dull.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255088982_4cc6138e6b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And dusty.

<p>
Mostly consists of hourly motels.

<p>
But for the most part it's something like that. The room for 500 pesos ($11) was not very romantic - the catastrophic lack of brightness of the light bulbs was more likely to hide old furniture and uninvited guests with six legs in the corners than to be conducive to love. But the furnishings of the room were very rich - almost a full-fledged one-bedroom apartment.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256862750_888963b8a8_h.jpg"/>

Traditionally, the main street is called Walking street.

During the day it is not walkable at all, but during the day there is nothing special to do there.

<p>
“The game”  goes something like this. The main street is mostly gogo bars. There are often promo girls standing near the entrance. Inside there is a platform filled with girls in swimsuits. There is no real go-go dancing there, they just stand there moving their hips a bit. Groups change periodically. Margaery and Cersei were not seen.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255819011_748c84ca5d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are 1-2 old men sitting at the tables, with a crowd of ladies around each one. Cultural conversations are held, then after paying for bar service, the action moves to another location.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255819106_ac4c284a8a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also a mama-san - this is like a bar manager for working with clients.

Men who hang out on the streets for a specific reason. They openly sell cigarettes, but in fact they offer...
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256862590_772f8981eb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
no, not marijuana. Who needs it here? Of course, Viagra and analogues.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256021263_8a37730338_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Of course, there is no youth party here. The only place that remotely resembles a club is ambiguously called High Society. There is even face control at the entrance, or the appearance of it. Essentially, this is a disco with disgustingly loud (to the point of heartache) music, where you can pick up girls without paying a commission to the bar.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257751915_fe6c37e9a2_h.jpg"/>

And nearby the men are simply playing chess and living against the system.

Bed spacer is what they call a neighbor with whom they rent a house in half to make it cheaper. Are they renting housing in the slums, I wonder? Or someone wants to get out of the slums, and therefore is looking for a companion?
