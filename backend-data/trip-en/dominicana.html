<h1>Dominican Republic: Santo Domingo, Jarabacoa, La Vega, Santiago, Puerto Plata, Sosua</h1>
<i>23-29 November 2016</i>
<h2>Jimani</h2>
<p>
I crossed the border of Haiti and the Dominican Republic very quickly. I wanted to finally get to the Dominican Republic so much that I even gave the Dominicans a $20 bribe without arguing. I'm successful! I survived Haiti! I expected the contrast at the border to be greater than between Cambodia and Thailand.
... and then there was a knock from the bottom.
The first suspicions appeared almost immediately. The border terminals of the two countries were equally squalid and chaotic, and after the border there was the same garbage dump and broken road. Having taken a motorcycle taxi to the nearest town of Jimani, I changed money and went to buy a SIM card. There were stalls of two main operators nearby, but Orange was locked (the time was already past 11, since in the Dominican Republic clocks are set one hour ahead compared to Haiti), and at Claro, they told me that they don’t sell SIM cards here. Surprised, I boarded a minibus heading to Santo Domingo (250 kilometers).
While we were driving, along the roadside I saw the same piles of garbage as in Haiti, fences made of sticks covered with barbed wire, and destroyed cars. Back then I still thought that it was all the Haitians littering the area near the border.
Every half hour the bus stopped, and some shady types in wrinkled T-shirts checked everyone’s passports; at one checkpoint they even searched the bags. Even 200 kilometers from the border there were such “checkpoints”.
The bus was driving incredibly slowly. Halfway in the city of Neiba, it stood for almost an hour. There was a Haitian-level shithole all around.
And 40 kilometers before the capital, it stopped for lunch again! The bottom has been broken: even in Indonesia, buses travel faster.
I thought that leaving at 7 am, I would arrive in Santo Domingo in the afternoon. It turned out that I wouldn’t even make it before sunset. 8 hours for 240 kilometers. Somewhere around here I had a shocking, unimaginable thought:
IT WAS BETTER IN HAITI
<p/>
<h2>Santo Domingo</h2>
<p>
Santo Domingo is the oldest city in the Americas founded by Europeans. Groups of tourists are brought here on excursions from resort hotels surrounded by high fences, and they walk along several central streets. Outside this zone, as well as at night, when tourists leave, it is a typical third world country.

It's not bad on the main street during the day.

There are police officers at all intersections. Can you spot them in the photographs?

There, by the way, is a cruise ship, tourists from which are walking around the city center.

<p>
Since almost all the tourists here are either from a cruise ship or on a day excursion, at night the old city dies out and becomes relatively creepy.
<p/>

The streets are full of closed windows.

During the day:

<p>
Near the old town there is a rich area with government buildings and mansions, it looks civilized at first glance.
<p/>

<p>
The peculiarity of McDonald's in the Dominican Republic: here you can take a quadruple Big Mac (like we have at Burger King), and adding two meat patties will cost only $1. I often ate quadruple Big Macs and the royal burger.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256492340_3211e5932b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Typical Dominican food is unremarkable and consists mainly of fried chicken with fried plantains. Local fast food - "King of Chicken", also with royal prices.

<h2>Jarabacoa</h2>
<p>
From the huge and creepy Santo Domingo, I went to the small town of Jarabacoa in the mountains of the central Cordillera.
<p/>

It’s cozy and not crowded, but at night the music plays loudly in the center. The atmosphere is reminiscent of the province in <a href="../angkor">Cambodia</a> or <a href="../sulawesi">Indonesia</a>.

Something like this can easily be found in Indonesia. I believe these are traces of the local dictatorial regime.

Jarabacoa is not rich in attractions. There is a waterfall about 5 kilometers from the city, so I went there on foot. Outside the center there are vegetable gardens everywhere.

<h2>La Vega</h2>
<p>
Concepción de la Vega is a typical provincial town. The city is small and not mentioned in guidebooks. There is a steam locomotive in the central square.

Santiago de los Caballeros is the second largest city in the Dominican Republic. It is located in the depths of the island. This city can hardly be called attractive, the entire center is an unimpressive bazaar, however, I stayed here for two days because I checked into a nice cheap hotel.

Suddenly a car with German license plates. How did it get here? Did someone transport the car on a ship?
<p/>

And even stranger - the numbers are either UAE or Jordan.

<h2>Puerto Plata</h2>
<p>
Puerto Plata is like a resort; many charters fly here from America. I have never seen such an enchanting “resort”...
<p/>

<p>
I checked into a motel near the bus station on the edge of town. The quality of the roads and sidewalks here, of course, is not good.
<p/>

In some places they are completely absent.

There is an old part of the city a little away from the embankment and the beach.
<p/>

<p>
Not bad.

For some reason, cathedrals in the Dominican Republic are all distinguished by their strict forms and simplicity.

And here is the beach!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255941032_87f026b044_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Compared to this, the beaches in the centers of industrial <a href="../sumatra">Indonesian cities</a> will seem crystal clear!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256669436_de50363a66_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is a better beach, even some tourists swim here.
<p/>

The water looks quite clean.

<p>
This is the cleanest section of the beach I found. In general, there is nothing to do here, go to Malaysia.

<h2>Sosua</h2>
<p>
Packers usually vacation not in Puerto Plata, but in the neighboring city of Sosua. The beach here is not as trashy as in Puerto Plata, it’s an ordinary beach, just a little narrow.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256585065_00d2b760c6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It looks like a low-end resort, with a broken path along the beach and relatively inexpensive restaurants.
<p/>

There are a lot of sex tourists here, a type well known to us from <a href="../pattaya">Pattaya</a>.
