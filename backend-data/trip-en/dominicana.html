<h1>Dominican Republic: Santo Domingo, Jarabacoa, La Vega, Santiago, Puerto Plata, Sosua</h1>
<i>23-29 November 2016</i>
<h2>Jimani</h2>
<p>
I crossed the border of Haiti and the Dominican Republic very quickly. I wanted to finally get to the Dominican Republic so much that I even gave the Dominicans a $20 bribe without arguing. I'm successful! I survived Haiti! I expected the contrast at the border to be greater than between Cambodia and Thailand.
... and then there was a knock from the bottom.
The first suspicions appeared almost immediately. The border terminals of the two countries were equally squalid and chaotic, and after the border there was the same garbage dump and broken road. Having taken a motorcycle taxi to the nearest town of Jimani, I changed money and went to buy a SIM card. There were stalls of two main operators nearby, but Orange was locked (the time was already past 11, since in the Dominican Republic clocks are set one hour ahead compared to Haiti), and at Claro, they told me that they don’t sell SIM cards here. Surprised, I boarded a minibus heading to Santo Domingo (250 kilometers).
While we were driving, along the roadside I saw the same piles of garbage as in Haiti, fences made of sticks covered with barbed wire, and destroyed cars. Back then I still thought that it was all the Haitians littering the area near the border.
Every half hour the bus stopped, and some shady types in wrinkled T-shirts checked everyone’s passports; at one checkpoint they even searched the bags. Even 200 kilometers from the border there were such “checkpoints”.
The bus was driving incredibly slowly. Halfway in the city of Neiba, it stood for almost an hour. There was a Haitian-level shithole all around.
And 40 kilometers before the capital, it stopped for lunch again! The bottom has been broken: even in Indonesia, buses travel faster.
I thought that leaving at 7 am, I would arrive in Santo Domingo in the afternoon. It turned out that I wouldn’t even make it before sunset. 8 hours for 240 kilometers. Somewhere around here I had a shocking, unimaginable thought:
IT WAS BETTER IN HAITI
<p/>
<h2>Santo Domingo</h2>
<p>
Santo Domingo is the oldest city in the Americas founded by Europeans. Groups of tourists are brought here on excursions from resort hotels surrounded by high fences, and they walk along several central streets. Outside this zone, as well as at night, when tourists leave, it is a typical third world country.

The peculiarity of McDonald's in the Dominican Republic: here you can take a quadruple Big Mac (like we have at Burger King), and adding two meat patties will cost only $1. I often ate quadruple Big Macs and the royal burger.

Santiago de los Caballeros is the second largest city in the Dominican Republic. It is located in the depths of the island. This city can hardly be called attractive, the entire center is an unimpressive bazaar, however, I stayed here for two days because I checked into a nice cheap hotel.

<h2>Puerto Plata</h2>

Puerto Plata is like a resort; many charters fly here from America. I have never seen such an enchanting “resort”...

I checked into a motel near the bus station on the edge of town. The quality of the roads and sidewalks here, of course, is not good.

<h2>Sosua</h2>
<p>
Packers usually vacation not in Puerto Plata, but in the neighboring city of Sosua. The beach here is not as trashy as in Puerto Plata, it’s an ordinary beach, just a little narrow.

It looks like a low-end resort, with a broken path along the beach and relatively inexpensive restaurants.
