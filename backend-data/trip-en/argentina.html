<h1>Argentina: Rosario, Cordoba, Posadas</h1>
<i>10-12 January 2013</i>
<h2>Rosario</h2>
<p>
The overall impression is often determined by all sorts of little things. In this regard, I was unlucky with the city of Rosario. The most important impression of Rosario is the bus station there, which is a terrible cesspool. In addition to the general shabby appearance, that can't surprise a person who has been to the east of Europe, the station is literally inhabited by a pack of dogs that lie right in the halls. This is both dangerous and simply disgusting.
At the entrance to Rosario you can see the embodiment of Argentina's economic success.

<p>
The slums in Buenos Aires and Brazilian cities are much more civilized. At least the houses there are not made of polyethylene.

<p>
Leaning fences.

<p>
Closer to the city center there are more prosperous houses, with stone fences.
<p/>

<p>
Rosario is mainly known for being the birthplace of Che Guevara. Here in this house. You can't go inside without a key.
<p/>

<p>
There is a memorial nearby.

<p>
A few meters from this square, Ernesto Che Guevara, a Rosarian who fought for justice and mercy, was born.

<p>
At the other end of the city, a monument was erected using public donations, the only one in Argentina.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255374791_854363b5e7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A much larger monument to, you know, what.
<p/>

<p>
Malvinas, with Argentina forever!
<p/>

<p>
Even larger is the monument to the Argentine flag, which was first raised in Rosario. Manuel Belgrano, a colleague of José de San Martin and the author of the flag, is buried there.

<p>
Like other cities in Argentina, Rosario is planned on a grid, and here this grid is huge, the streets do not change names for many kilometers, the house numbers are off the scale.
<p/>

<p>
The street names in the center are interesting. They are painted with paint, and an arrow below indicates the direction of movement along the street: left, right or two-way.
<p/>

<p>
Pedestrianized street.

<p>
Political propaganda hung around Che Guevara's house: "Gentlemen, entrepreneurs! A company cannot exist without workers! Let's appreciate our work!"
<p/>

<p>
At bus stops there are quite convenient pictures depicting the route. This is possible thanks to the grid layout. I wasn’t able to ride the bus, since you can only pay for the fare by putting money into a special machine inside the bus. But this machine only accepts coins, and I didn't have enough. In general, changing money in Argentina is a problem, since the largest coin has a value of about $0.10, prices have long gone up due to inflation, and buses still do not accept banknotes. Fortunately, I did not encounter another problem, counterfeiting money. Argentine money looks incredibly poor, and the small notes are a terrible shambles.

<p>
All Argentinean toilets have a long and narrow flush button. By the way, at that same Rosario bus station, the urinals are free, but the booths are paid, although they monitor this carefully only when there are almost no people. This is where there is no end to the fight against all kinds of discrimination!

<p>
And so, the city is like a city. Pleasant in places.
<p/>

<p>
In some places it looks a little like a castle.

<h2>Cordoba</h2>
<p>
In Cordoba, I never came across the Malvinas Islands monument (although it is there somewhere). But I did see something better: the Malvinas Argentinas bus company.
<p/>

<p>
A small piece from the seventeenth century has survived in Cordoba.
<p/>

<p>
There are mostly apartment buildings around.
<p/>

<p>
Peron Boulevard.
<p/>

<p>
An interesting new building, in which they immediately installed boxes for air conditioners under each window.
<p/>

<p>
Excellent bus display.
<p/>

<p>
Advertising for Spanish courses. In general, Cordoba is considered a city of students; it has the oldest university in Argentina.
<p/>

<p>
Each one has a year written on it, and grateful residents also left their autographs.

"It is a great miracle that during all this time I have never lost hope. Diary of Anne Frank 15.7.44. For life and against all discrimination. Jewish community of Cordoba"
<p/>

<p>
I still had money to spend (changing Argentine pesos for hard currency is problematic), so I started tasting ice cream.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256781594_221551aaac_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Ice cream in Cordoba is sold in a large number of shops in the pedestrian area. The price is very attractive - one ball is less than 15 rubles, how can you not go wild. The diversity makes my eyes widen. There is even a “Russian cream”, which, judging by the taste, is called creme brulee in our country.
<p/>

<p>
The political struggle is taking place right in the streets.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256781654_b34b6ff9a2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Some slogans on top of others.
<p/>

<p>
A popular service in Argentina is to wash windows while the car is at a traffic light.
<p/>

<p>
In general, come to Cordoba, it’s fun here.
<p/>

<h2>Posadas</h2>
<p>
Posadas is a town on the border with Paraguay.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255934372_0de5c5e4d2_h.jpg"/>

<p>
There is nothing here but dusty roads.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255934332_683bc65543_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And overgrown sidewalks.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255934307_784a8069a8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are also very long streets here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255934462_583001968d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Backyard.
<p/>

<p>
Monument... no, not Lenin, San Martin.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257409869_2c1408cfa5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
"Christina Kirchner is a <strike>president</strike> bitch"
<p/>

<p>
“Inflation is hitting everyone, give us the minimum wage of 2000 now!”
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255934417_061643a8a6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
"Get out of Iguazu, Yankees!" This is not the first time, by the way. How can you go to this national park after this?
<p/>

<p>
The main thing in Posadas is the bridge over the Parana River leading to Paraguay. The bridge was built relatively recently; before that, it was possible to cross the border only by ferry. Now it has become much easier for Argentines to travel to Paraguay to buy electronics and clothing that are sold without a protectionist markup.
