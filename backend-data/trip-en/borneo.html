<h2>Kuching</h2>
<p>
Once upon a time, the entire northern coast of Borneo belonged to the Sultan of Brunei. But the inhabitants of the rivers and jungles had no strong desire to sponsor his treasury, and they were constantly in opposition. A certain James Brooke, an English businessman, successfully suppressed the uprising in 1841, for which he received as a reward the land where the city of Kuching is now. Brooke became rajah and gradually annexed almost the entire territory of Brunei to himself, leaving the Sultan only that pitiful piece, which to this day is called Brunei. Brooke and his dynasty of "White Rajahs" ruled Sarawak until the Japanese occupation in 1942, after the war the British abolished their autonomy.

Kuching means "cat" in Malay. There are other versions of the origin of the name: from the Chinese language or from the Malay name for the longan fruit - mata kucing (cat's eye). The cat is the symbol of the city, so it is depicted here together with the hornbill, the symbol of the state of Sarawak.
<p/>

<p>
There are several monumental compositions with cats in Kuching. This one.

And of course there is a cat museum here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256322346_7616b07cf8_o.jpg">
<p>
It's on the first floor of the city administration building.
<p/>

<p>
In general, I very rarely go to museums, but the cats are so cute that you can’t resist them.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255591737_21482f4d56_o.jpg">
<p>
The museum contains a lot of cat figurines.

The museum building also offers a good view of the city, although from quite a distance.

Let's look at the city of Kuching.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257068679_35755a2457_o.jpg">
<p>
This city is a mixture of times and styles, just like the entrance to a pedestrian street through a Chinese arch, over which they built a fashionable canopy for the entire street, but forgot to lay normal asphalt.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256321476_b2385075a6_o.jpg">
<p>
This building would look good as the city hall of some provincial city in the United States, which flourished in the 1920s.
<p/>

It seems to be a Christian church, but some kind of sect with red caps hangs out there. The conductor started from the roof.

Here's another building - a flying saucer. In theory, there should have been an observation deck there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256322141_9f3b3f0f8e_o.jpg">

There are no bridges across the river in the city center, instead you can take a ferry for 1 ringgit.

The hotel in Kuching was funny. Once upon a time it was luxurious, like Yanukovych’s dacha. The $10 room has a chandelier with stucco on the ceiling, from which the paint is peeling.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257362285_10302c9977_o.jpg">
<p>
There is an orangutan nursery in the vicinity of Kuching, but I didn’t go there because it was not the season and it was a bit far to go.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257068809_39f4d69af2_o.jpg">
<p>
Public transport in Kuching is the worst of any major city in Malaysia. Buses run on schedule once every two hours, and this is no joke. There is no transport to the airport at all. There is a bus to the bus station on the outskirts of the city every two hours, but there are no fast minibuses.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257361860_ffab0a2ace_o.jpg">
<p>
Sign: do not cross the road, use the overpass. I haven't seen anyone who adheres to it.
<p/>

<p>
Along the road with frequent traffic jams, there are billboards with dynamic content. From time to time they show advertisements for the Orthodox lifestyle.
<p/>

<h2>Kapit</h2>
<p>
Kapit is a very unusual city: it is one of the few cities that cannot be reached by road, only by river or plane. The largest of these cities is Iquitos in Peru, but Kapit is also not a village - there are 20 thousand people there. You can practically go to Kapit in two hours by high-speed ship from Sibu along the Rajang River.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256997039_b721042edb_o.jpg">
<p>
The fare is 25 ringgit one way ($6).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257290945_69d875bda4_o.jpg">
<p>
Kapit is a rare opportunity to travel deep into Sarawak. All major cities are located near the coast.
<p/>

The interior of Borneo is being developed. Forests are being cut down slowly.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256996879_b7b0263989_o.jpg">
<p>
Kapit, like other large cities, is inhabited mainly by Chinese. Borneo's indigenous people, the Dayaks, historically lived along rivers away from the coast.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257291055_c4ea2ac4ef_o.jpg">
<p>
Their housing is called a “longhouse” - a communal apartment with a long corridor and small rooms.

To this day, many Dayaks live in longhouses and go to Kapit for shopping.

Hotels in Borneo are slightly more expensive than on the mainland - 15 dollars on average versus 10. Food costs the same, only my favorite teh tarik tea is more expensive.

<h2>Niah National Park</h2>
<p>
Halfway between the cities of Bintulu and Miri, about 10 kilometers from the highway, there is the little-known (compared to the famous Gunung Mulu) Niah National Park.

<h2>Miri</h2>
<p>
Miri is the last city in the state of Sarawak, further along the highway there is Brunei, into which Russian citizens are not allowed. There is no other road connecting the two states of Malay Borneo (or rather, there is one deep in the jungle, but it is not connected to the main road network of the state of Sarawak). Therefore, the next step was to fly by plane, bypassing Brunei.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255716977_ae9a9c9146_o.jpg">
<p>
Miri is the first city in Borneo to pump oil. Therefore, here the cheapest hotel near the bus station that I found cost 20 dollars, and in general it is rich here.

<h2>Labuan</h2>
<p>
Labuan is a small island off the coast of Borneo. This is a separate region of Malaysia (federal territory like Kuala Lumpur) and a duty-free zone. Interestingly, when arriving in the states of Sabah and Sarawak, they put stamps in the passport, even if you fly from mainland Malaysia. But on Labuan they don’t put it, and if you leave there by ferry, they don’t put it either.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255604532_70b82a8ddd_o.jpg">

A plane ticket from Miri to Labuan cost only $20.

Labuan is a special customs zone, here you can drink inexpensively. The main streets are lined with bars where residents of the conservative state of Sabah and the even more conservative Brunei go to party.
<p/>

Near Kota Kinabalu there is Tunku Abdul Rahman National Park. These are five islands: Gaya, Sapi, Manukan, Mabutik and Sulug. Boats often go from the port to these islands (except for Sulug, they go there only individually). A trip to one island for two costs about $20; you can go to 2-4 islands for a relatively small surcharge of $5 each. The largest island by far is Gaya, it has a population, but most of it is covered in forest.

It is believed that the ascent to this peak (>4000 meters) is simple and does not require any preparation. However, it takes two days and is not cheap, because the park has a kind of monopoly, and spending the night in a hostel halfway up the climb costs a lot of money. I didn't go up, limiting myself to walking through the jungle and the views.

There are several tracks through the forest in the park; in principle, you can walk around them all in a day.

Unlike Taman Negara, here you walk everywhere on the ground.

There is a small botanical garden near the main road.

I had previously seen some of the plants presented there in the forest.

Interestingly, the exit from the track was before the ticket office, that is, if you go in the opposite direction, you can enter the park without a ticket.
