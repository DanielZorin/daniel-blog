<h2>Kuching</h2>
<p>
Once upon a time, the entire northern coast of Borneo belonged to the Sultan of Brunei. But the inhabitants of the rivers and jungles had no strong desire to sponsor his treasury, and they were constantly in opposition. A certain James Brooke, an English businessman, successfully suppressed the uprising in 1841, for which he received as a reward the land where the city of Kuching is now. Brooke became rajah and gradually annexed almost the entire territory of Brunei to himself, leaving the Sultan only that pitiful piece, which to this day is called Brunei. Brooke and his dynasty of "White Rajahs" ruled Sarawak until the Japanese occupation in 1942, after the war the British abolished their autonomy.

<p>
Kuching means "cat" in Malay. There are other versions of the origin of the name: from the Chinese language or from the Malay name for the longan fruit - mata kucing (cat's eye). The cat is the symbol of the city, so it is depicted here together with the hornbill, the symbol of the state of Sarawak.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256321366_84f96c5ec0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are several monumental compositions with cats in Kuching. This one.

The gift shop is filled with cats.

<p>
And of course there is a cat museum here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256322346_00a1800d3b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It's on the first floor of the city administration building.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255591702_143a0cc528_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In general, I very rarely go to museums, but the cats are so cute that you can’t resist them.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255591737_0fef2643ff_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The museum contains a lot of cat figurines.

Photos.

<p>
And scientific information, such as how to curl up into a ball.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257069284_ccab910641_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The museum building also offers a good view of the city, although from quite a distance.

<p>
Let's look at the city of Kuching.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257068679_d46eb1260d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This city is a mixture of times and styles, just like the entrance to a pedestrian street through a Chinese arch, over which they built a fashionable canopy for the entire street, but forgot to lay normal asphalt.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256321476_e85bf2747c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This building would look good as the city hall of some provincial city in the United States, which flourished in the 1920s.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256519613_a6ec303732_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And this is the English colonial style.

<p>
Fort Margaret.

<p>
And this photograph seems to have come to us from <a href="../abkhazia">Abkhazia</a> or some other resort on the Black Sea.

<p>
It seems to be a Christian church, but some kind of sect with red caps hangs out there. The conductor started from the roof.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256519658_7d704b4aaf_h.jpg"/>

The main Christian church in Niemeyer style.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255591447_d1e983428a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here's another building - a flying saucer. In theory, there should have been an observation deck there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256322141_bd525b1b03_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But in reality this building is abandoned, only a lone security guard hangs out there.

<p>
An ordinary street, like everywhere else in Malaysia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255591167_6bdf8422ed_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are no bridges across the river in the city center, instead you can take a ferry for 1 ringgit.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256322231_077a6ce1f6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Across the river is a village that includes a palace, a government house and, in the distance on a hill, a cat museum.
<p/>

<p>
The hotel in Kuching was funny. Once upon a time it was luxurious, like Yanukovych’s dacha. The $10 room has a chandelier with stucco on the ceiling, from which the paint is peeling.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257362285_82dd2fb3fd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is an orangutan nursery in the vicinity of Kuching, but I didn’t go there because it was not the season and it was a bit far to go.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257068809_aef26f9923_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Public transport in Kuching is the worst of any major city in Malaysia. Buses run on schedule once every two hours, and this is no joke. There is no transport to the airport at all. There is a bus to the bus station on the outskirts of the city every two hours, but there are no fast minibuses.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257361860_753a82f63f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Sign: do not cross the road, use the overpass. I haven't seen anyone who adheres to it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257361820_9f3a8f9c00_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Along the road with frequent traffic jams, there are billboards with dynamic content. From time to time they show advertisements for the Orthodox lifestyle.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255591382_fa358f3178_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Kapit</h2>
<p>
Kapit is a very unusual city: it is one of the few cities that cannot be reached by road, only by river or plane. The largest of these cities is Iquitos in Peru, but Kapit is also not a village - there are 20 thousand people there. You can practically go to Kapit in two hours by high-speed ship from Sibu along the Rajang River.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256997039_c393851c8f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The fare is 25 ringgit one way ($6).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257290945_548c0217df_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Kapit is a rare opportunity to travel deep into Sarawak. All major cities are located near the coast.
<p/>

<p>
Bridge at the exit from Sibu. Apparently there will be a new highway.
<p/>

<p>
The interior of Borneo is being developed. Forests are being cut down slowly.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256996879_5314e86872_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Kapit, like other large cities, is inhabited mainly by Chinese. Borneo's indigenous people, the Dayaks, historically lived along rivers away from the coast.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257291055_6a96a7ec49_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Their housing is called a “longhouse” - a communal apartment with a long corridor and small rooms.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256448323_dd6c298528_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Le Corbusier's dream straight out.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255519622_8055c55d70_h.jpg"/>
<p>
To this day, many Dayaks live in longhouses and go to Kapit for shopping.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255519632_c981224a5c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Their boats, probably.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257291165_3b6139a8b0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Kapit has all the amenities of civilization, including inexpensive hotels.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257291225_b604088698_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Moreover, on this edge of the world in the middle of the jungle there is even a KFC!
<p/>

<p>
Let's look at the city, it is quite compact. Here is the square with the clock.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257291270_3b130acabf_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Historical building - Fort Silvia, second half of the 19th century. Founded by the White Raja.

There is nothing on the other side of the river, only Comets parking.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256997169_80623490a1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is an inexpensive hotel for $10.

Market. You can buy some asam payak.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256448923_43d7c4b542_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Although there is no road to Kapit from the mainland, there are wheeled vehicles here. There is even public transport in the form of traditional Borneo minibuses.
<p/>

The city center ends, the residential part begins.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256448993_0b14953a70_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Everything is on stilts because it floods a lot here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256250341_b9a2e1c61f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The suspension bridge looks flimsy, but motorcycles can easily cross it.
<p/>

<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255520182_e274962060_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Behind the bridge there seems to be a new area; a giant administrative building has been built for the future.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255520207_0767d2bdc0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Ravine.
<p/>

<p>
The asphalt was broken.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257291805_ce79c7414c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The administrative building rises in the middle of the jungle.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257291875_b436de7d8a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This road leads back to the city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256449318_f83f958724_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Only at first glance this is a longhouse; in fact, each one has a separate entrance.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256997804_035b0aba41_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And here is Kapit Airport, very close to the city center. There is a "no entry" sign hanging.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256250706_8949aeeae0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But the airport itself has long been gone. This is the first time I'm standing on a runway.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256449383_29842f50a1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the thickets you can see a thoroughly abandoned airport terminal building.

<h2>Sibu</h2>
<p>
Sibu is one of the most Chinese cities in Malaysia; the Chinese population here is more than 90%. Islam is not felt at all.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254776812_729dc62538_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The station is pure China.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255711263_235a519359_h.jpg"/>
<p>
We checked into a high quality Chinese hotel.
<p/>

<p>
This is where I first tried asam payak.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256551120_66f989d2f1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The most interesting thing in Sibu is the central market.
<p/>

<p>
All exotic Borneo is sold here.

There is also a breathtaking Brazilian-style Catholic cathedral in Sibu.

And somewhere in the wilds of Borneo there is a trailer painted in the colors of the Russian flag.

<h2>Bintulu</h2>
<p>
I stopped in the city of Bintulu to spend the night while traveling through the state of Sarawak.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255926811_7ab459b8d0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This city is also inhabited mainly by Chinese. The city is rich because oil is produced in this area of Borneo.

Hotels in Borneo are slightly more expensive than on the mainland - 15 dollars on average versus 10. Food costs the same, only my favorite teh tarik tea is more expensive.

Early in the morning I headed towards Niah Park.
<p/>

<p>
The road in Borneo looks something like this.

<h2>Niah National Park</h2>
<p>
Halfway between the cities of Bintulu and Miri, about 10 kilometers from the highway, there is the little-known (compared to the famous Gunung Mulu) Niah National Park.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255907061_d6eb1bdd40_h.jpg"/>
<p>
After entering, you first need to cross the river.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255177067_09db2fc97c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Then go about three kilometers through the jungle.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255177122_397c204cae_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Paths like in Taman Negara Park.

The jungle in Borneo looks even denser.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255177202_f8d003f89c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The only animals are insects and monkeys somewhere in the distance.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256949560_a80944d9e7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And now we come to the goal - a rather big cave.
<p/>

<p>
Does it look awesome? This is just the beginning. Around the bend the real thing begin to appear.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256949795_d65c7b514e_h.jpg"/>

Looking out...
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256108213_ff530fe35b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And we go deeper.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255906951_5a693b1ea3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You can see how small people are compared to this cave.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255177587_1a52646f2e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Let's go deeper.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256949985_245111f70d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It shines from above through the gap.

This is the exit of the cave, but it is closed.
<p/>

<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256656054_aefa0feb34_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The path leads even lower into the darkness.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255177847_25f8fe5878_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A few hundred meters further you need to walk in complete darkness, scaring away the mosquitoes that fly into the light of the phone.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255177912_88682bc67e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And here is the exit from the opposite end of the cave.
<p/>

<p>
After walking a little through the jungle, you can climb into a second, smaller cave.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256950450_38a20e415b_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256950485_871cbdd271_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are ancient rock paintings here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255907466_729ea9e6f4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It was not bad for people in ancient times, in such a luxurious place.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256950525_73490e2e0e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
From here you can return back along the same road. During the entire time in the cave I met about 15 people.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256108953_19a1bfedc2_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256950555_52d9e3dddc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On the way back we walked a couple of kilometers through a palm plantation to the nearest village, from where we hitchhiked the car to the bus station on the highway.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256950580_089db52548_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Miri</h2>
<p>
Miri is the last city in the state of Sarawak, further along the highway there is Brunei, into which Russian citizens are not allowed. There is no other road connecting the two states of Malay Borneo (or rather, there is one deep in the jungle, but it is not connected to the main road network of the state of Sarawak). Therefore, the next step was to fly by plane, bypassing Brunei.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255716977_ddfb3b5eb6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Miri is the first city in Borneo to pump oil. Therefore, here the cheapest hotel near the bus station that I found cost 20 dollars, and in general it is rich here.
<p/>

<h2>Labuan</h2>
<p>
Labuan is a small island off the coast of Borneo. This is a separate region of Malaysia (federal territory like Kuala Lumpur) and a duty-free zone. Interestingly, when arriving in the states of Sabah and Sarawak, they put stamps in the passport, even if you fly from mainland Malaysia. But on Labuan they don’t put it, and if you leave there by ferry, they don’t put it either.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255604532_18e48709ac_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A plane ticket from Miri to Labuan cost only $20.

Ferries operate from Kota Kinabalu and Brunei to Labuan.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256533088_af176b1974_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The airport is located a couple of kilometers from the capital of the island, minibuses go past.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256335486_9059664797_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The cheap hotels in Labuan are not that great, but I still found a place for $10 with air conditioning from a Rooms for Rent sign at the entrance of a residential building. There was no need to check into the abandoned Labuan Hotel.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257375800_d6f16115bd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Labuan is a special customs zone, here you can drink inexpensively. The main streets are lined with bars where residents of the conservative state of Sabah and the even more conservative Brunei go to party.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256533578_f08814ba9c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I bought a can of Guinness at the store for just $1. In other cities of Malaysia it costs three or four dollars.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256335981_912b23323b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The capital of the island is called Victoria. It is not rich in interesting places, besides bars. Here is a Chinese temple.

Near the bird park there is a strange attraction - a pipe.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257376160_192c37b890_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I would assume that this is an ordinary pipe from some factory or boiler room, but the description for it says that no one knows what it is intended for.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255604977_05f8e14a64_h.jpg"/>

There is a lot of civilization in the city. This is expressed in the presence of numerous shopping centers (including the largest in Borneo outside the city).

Near Kota Kinabalu there is Tunku Abdul Rahman National Park. These are five islands: Gaya, Sapi, Manukan, Mabutik and Sulug. Boats often go from the port to these islands (except for Sulug, they go there only individually). A trip to one island for two costs about $20; you can go to 2-4 islands for a relatively small surcharge of $5 each. The largest island by far is Gaya, it has a population, but most of it is covered in forest.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255555737_a74c829fcd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Sapi and Manukan are the most developed islands, with many restaurants and bungalows. This is Sapi.
<p/>

I went to Mabutik, the smallest of the islands. But there was no paradise on the level of the Perhentians either.
<p/>

<h2>Kinabalu National Park</h2>
<p>
In the depths of the island of Borneo is the highest point of Malaysia - Mount Kinabalu.

It is believed that the ascent to this peak (>4000 meters) is simple and does not require any preparation. However, it takes two days and is not cheap, because the park has a kind of monopoly, and spending the night in a hostel halfway up the climb costs a lot of money. I didn't go up, limiting myself to walking through the jungle and the views.

There are several tracks through the forest in the park; in principle, you can walk around them all in a day.

Unlike Taman Negara, here you walk everywhere on the ground.

There is a small botanical garden near the main road.

I had previously seen some of the plants presented there in the forest.

Interestingly, the exit from the track was before the ticket office, that is, if you go in the opposite direction, you can enter the park without a ticket.
