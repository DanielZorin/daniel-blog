<h1>Luxembourg</h1>
<i>10-11 April 2024</i>
<h2>Bettembourg, Esch-sur-Alzette</h2>
<p>
I was in Luxembourg a long time ago, but still, just seeing the capital is not enough for this country - it is not that small, and there is a lot of beauty in it. So from eastern France I decided to move there. I got off the train at the first station after the border - Bettembourg.

<p>
Cities in Luxembourg look modest and austere, more German than French.

<p>
There are many castles (schloss/chateau) in Luxembourg, most of them are palaces/estates, but there are also fortified ones. Bettembourg Castle:

<p>
Very vintage cafe/club/pool room. In general, in Luxembourg there is a lot of old and vintage stuff, people here love the classics.

<p>
Police. The inscription in Luxembourgish: "Zesumme fir iech" (Together for you). In German it would be "Zusammen für euch". The Luxembourgish language is similar to the dialects of the surrounding regions of Germany; if Luxembourg were not a separate state, it would also be considered a dialect. In the nearby French regions, similar German dialects used to be spoken, but now they are almost replaced by the French language.
<p/>

<p>
They say that Luxembourg is very expensive, but in my opinion prices there are about the same as in France (except for housing). Here is the menu of a Chinese restaurant, it would be the same in France.
<p/>

<p>
Gasoline is also relatively cheap in Luxembourg, so people from neighboring countries go there to refuel. And public transport is completely free since 2020! Unlike Tallinn, where transport is free only for city residents, in Luxembourg they generously made it free for everyone, even tourists. The ticket machine menu now looks like this. You can also buy a first class ticket for 6 euros per day.

<p>
In 10-15 minutes I arrived in Esch-sur-Alzette, the second largest city in Luxembourg. The sign at the station is vintage. The first word in the name of the city is written according to German spelling, and the preposition and second word are written in French.

Cities in Luxembourg are very small; the historical part is often comparable in size to French villages. Central square:

In the northern third of Luxembourg the railway was closed for repairs, the last station was Ettelbrück, and then it's only by bus.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53652938031_a967d8241e_o.jpg" >

<p>
Hostel in Vianden. The place costs 33 euros, which is not cheap (although prices in Paris are about the same). Hotels in Luxembourg are really expensive, especially in the capital. Outside the capital, you can, in principle, find one for 50 euros, if you do it a little in advance (but I screwed up). There are hostels in the capital and Esch-sur-Alzette, but they ran out of space, so I went to Vianden. There are several more hostels in the countryside, but Vianden is better in terms of transport accessibility, and it was very nice to take a walk in the fresh air in the morning.

There were several tourists near the palace, and someone else was filming the changing of the guard with a cool television camera.

<h2>Schengen</h2>
<p>
The last point in Luxembourg was a town whose name is well known to every traveler. On June 14, 1985, on a ship in the middle of the Moselle River at the junction of the borders of France, Germany and Luxembourg near the town of Schengen, an agreement was signed that abolished borders within Europe. It came into force only 10 years later, in 1995, and for the first two years there were only five countries in the Schengen zone: France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg (and borders between the Benelux countries were abolished even earlier).

Schengen is located in the south-eastern corner of Luxembourg, from the capital it takes about 30 minutes by bus. There is no railway here, although there is a line on the other side of the river in Germany. The city looks something like this:

It’s funny that the Schengen Agreement was signed by a man named Goebbels from Luxembourg, so the name of the street should specify which Goebbels.

Germany on the left, Luxembourg on the right. The island in the middle of the river (separate with a canal with a lock) is already France, as is the territory on the bank to the left of the island and beyond.
