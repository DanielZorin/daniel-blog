<h1>Spain: Aranjuez, Alcala de Henares, Escorial, Segovia, Toledo</h1>
<i>16-25 February 2012</i>
<h2>Aranjuez</h2>
<p>
The most Russian of Spanish cities, which, ironically, is home to the royal summer palace.
<p/>

<p>
There are even shabby walls.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256872905_0b61546c7a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And backyards.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256577759_fbde4b9dcd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The difference is in the details.

<h2>Alcala de Henares</h2>
<p>
If anyone thinks that Spain has only narrow medieval streets and villas, then I hasten to disappoint. There are also large numbers of panel apartment buildings in Spain.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256003628_803e7366f4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Alcala de Henares is the birthplace of Cervantes.
<p/>

<p>
Everything reminds of Don Quixote.
<p/>

<p>
Near the house where the writer was born, there is a bench where everyone takes pictures.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256003903_8064dd0dec_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In addition to street names, the houses indicate directions to popular services such as mail and telephone.
<p/>

<p>
Board with bus schedule.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256550149_4fbb3665ed_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are relief signs scattered throughout Spain from Madrid to the Canary Islands.
<p/>

<p>
You can't play ball.
<p/>

<p>
Garbage bin.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255071967_b9d2350f99_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Bare trees.
<p/>

<p>
Spanish web in the shape of an octahedron.

<p>
An amazing traffic light - it has a time counter, and the green light is on for a minute, although the road itself is tiny, even one car can barely squeeze through.
<p/>

<h2>San Lorenzo de El Escorial</h2>
<p>
I went to Escorial to see the graves of the Spanish kings, but in the end I spent the longest time walking around one of the rooms of the palace and studying the geographical maps of the 16-17 centuries hanging on the walls.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255360062_61f0685fa3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Near the palace, schoolgirls played football with a red ball.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257133090_b1ff0943a6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The town of San Lorenzo de El Escorial has beautiful signs.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256838049_7cf2155318_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Excellent flashlights.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256012592_356c266317_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And mailboxes on which the word “mail” is for some reason written in English.
<p/>

<h2>El Escorial</h2>
<p>
The station is located under the mountain, in the town of El Escorial.
<p/>

<p>
Here, cars travel in an improvised tunnel made of intertwined trees.

<h2>Segovia</h2>
<p>
The main feature of the city of Segovia is the unusual relief patterns on the walls of houses.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254748892_97a7b69635_h.jpg"/>

<p>
The patterns are very different.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256523640_a270679b38_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And not only on old houses in the center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256227444_732f26a9f8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But most of all, of course, on them.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256523655_7468c62657_h.jpg"/>

<p>
They probably come from the local castle.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254748847_c5cbc28dc5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The castle stands in a picturesque place near a cliff.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254748827_7bb7b4150d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
From there you have an excellent view of the province of Castile and Leon.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255479691_ccf13a3bda_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The house with spikes on the walls stands apart. It's called Casa de los Picos.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254748997_24f3276d9c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Beautiful street signs.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256523505_62cfec606e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In some places there are explanations of who the street is named after.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256227174_7d08e87b33_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A Roman aqueduct has also stood here for two thousand years.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256523535_a671a018be_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And there are chairs placed on the streets.
<p/>

<h2>Toledo</h2>
<p>
Toledo, Santa Barbara area.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256385339_4eeb21ba76_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But this is not the main thing here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256385164_35eeb8e923_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The street names seem to have been preserved straight from the Middle Ages.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255840503_6970a01b00_h.jpg"/>

<p>
Toledo had a large Jewish community, and there is even a museum in its honor. I somehow very fortunately ended up in Toledo on a day when all the museums were open for free, so I spent a lot of time visiting the museums.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256121642_02b2e47d7e_h.jpg"/>

Street name in Hebrew letters.
<p/>

<p>
In the castle there is a museum of the history of Spain, where I spent a long time studying the text on the stands, memorizing various facts from history. The history of Spain, somewhere from the 18th century, is not studied at all in our schools, with the exception of the Civil War.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254906247_6d84067170_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is another trade union meeting on the square.
<p/>

<p/>

<p>
At the station there is a very vintage old ticket office. But tickets are already sold in the new one.
