<h1>El Salvador: Ahuachapan, San Salvador, La Libertad, San Miguel</h1>
<i>23-24 October 2021</i>
<h2>Ahuachapan</h2>
<p>
Having left Antigua at night, at 8 am I was already in El Salvador - a country that ranks honorably first in the world in the number of murders. I got off the highway in the first town after the border called Ahuachapan and started looking around.

<p>
The men were waiting for the bus at the sign, I joined them, and within five minutes I was riding for $0.25 on a crowded bus towards the city center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51784115224_785c40b614_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The bus looked something like this. I got out in the central square, which is adjacent to the market.
<p/>

<p>
It’s all one big market here, a lot of people go back and forth. SIM cards are sold on every corner, I went to the first cart, sat under an umbrella and after 10 minutes I got a ton of internet for $2.

Someone goes and sells paintings, there are quite a few of them here. Paintings on religious themes are popular.

This large line of people is standing at the entrance to the bank. For some reason there is such a queue at the entrance to every bank in El Salvador.

<p>
Since it is dangerous in El Salvador, many places are fully guarded - the guards carry machine guns. In this photo you can see a little, but in general I was a little shy and didn’t take pictures particularly openly. They mainly guard banks and, for some reason, pharmacies.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51736391764_9063240a46_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Grocery stores also come with bars.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51736634170_03ff7d4211_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But pharmacies are being fully strengthened.

By the way, there is some old architecture in the city center.

And of course a large inscription with the name of the city, this is popular everywhere in Central America.

<h2>Ruta de las Flores</h2>
<p>
In El Salvador there is a tourist route called Ruta de las Flores (Road of Flowers). This is the road between the towns of Ahuachapan and Sonsonate, which passes through a beautiful hilly area. Conveniently, due to the high population density in El Salvador, buses between villages on this route run every 10 minutes, making it very easy to get around by public transport. In Ahuachapan I took a bus to the village of Apaneca.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51735980763_7a9b3990df_h.jpg"/>

<p>
The first section of the route has the most beautiful views from the window (further is also good, but trees often block the view).

In Latin America now there is such a crazy thing - at the entrance to stores there is a basin to “disinfect” shoes, so that you don’t bring the coronavirus on your shoes from the street.
<p/>

Public transport for those who don't have $0.50 for a bus. The entire journey along the flower road cost me 3 dollars (if you go without transfers, it will be about 2).

<h2>San Salvador</h2>
<i>
In the nineties they killed people, and everyone ran around completely naked.
There was no electricity anywhere, just fights over jeans and Coca-Cola.
</i>
<p>
As in other Latin American countries, crime in El Salvador is concentrated primarily in the capital, San Salvador. The essence of crime in El Salvador is that there are large gangs that are so powerful and influential that they control social and economic life in competition with the state. Simply put, "Mara Salvatrucha" has a number of guns comparable to the Salvadoran police/army, has a solid income from the business of transporting drugs between Colombia and the United States, and at the same time 'taxes' small businessmen who work in their territories (such as taxi drivers or street traders). In principle, this situation is not alien to the residents of Russia - in the 90s it was about the same: if you have a stall, you have to pay for the 'roof' with some kind of "Orekhovsky" or "Medvedkovsky" gang.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51735696451_4093b325ce_h.jpg"/>

<p>
The practical conclusion from this is the following - even in cheap hotels for $10, there are iron bars on the door that are closed by default even during the day. And in a more expensive hotel for 30 dollars there is a whole defensive system with a remote-controlled iron door, and of course the windows are blocked.
<p/>

<p>
On the streets, police officers stand in bulletproof vests and with machine guns at the ready.

<p>
But ordinary people, in principle, live ordinary lives, like the vast majority of our parents in the 90s. In the central square they dance the waltz, for example.

El Salvador is a libertarian's dream. In 2021, Bitcoin was made the second national currency along with the dollar. This means that in this market from the 90s you can pay with bitcoins in many places.

This part of the city resembles small-town America with the number of signs along the road. It's quite civilized here, with a lot of fast food and shopping centers.

Apparently there are no people willing to swim. It seems like you can surf here, and quite inexpensively, but of course not on this central beach, but a little further away.

There are a lot of hotels around the bus station; I checked into a good one for $12. I tried to find out about buses to Tegucigalpa, they said that I had to go to the highway to catch them, so I decided to take the classic route to the border and walk across.
