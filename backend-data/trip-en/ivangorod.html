<h1>Russia: Ivangorod</h1>
<i>14 October 2016</i>
<h2>Ivangorod</h2>
<p>
On the other side of the river from Narva is the Russian city of Ivangorod. The contrast here is huge. Of course, Ivangorod is a very small city, practically a village, but due to the fact that it is on the border, it could be made better than the average Russian village for 10 thousand people. Otherwise, on the Estonian side there is a huge new customs terminal, and on the Russian side there is a filthy booth where you have to walk along planks through puddles. In Narva there is an embankment-promenade along the river, in Ivangorod there is a muddy country road.

I have not been to the fortress.

For obvious reasons, there are ten times fewer visitors than in Narva, and the opening hours are very limited.

In general, Russia is quite calm, but specifically in this city I felt a little nervous, perhaps in contrast to Europe.

It takes more than 30 minutes to walk to the railway station; it is actually outside the city. You can get there by taxi for only 80-100 rubles if you call a taxi by phone. The train to St. Petersburg is once a day (passing Tallinn-Moscow), but seats there cost only 300 rubles. If you find yourself in Ivangorod in the evening, this is the only direct route, since buses to St. Petersburg also run only three times a day, and the last time is around 4-5 pm. You can also take a taxi about 20 kilometers to the city of Kingisepp, from there there is more transport.
