<h1>Saint Vincent and the Grenadines</h1>
<i>18 November 2016</i>
<p>
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is one of the Caribbean countries least visited by tourists. There is still no large airport or direct flights to the USA; you can only get there with a transfer on one of the neighboring islands (St. Lucia, Trinidad or Barbados). The few resort hotels have a touch of exclusivity and even more inflated prices than on other islands. The locals live modestly, like in other poor countries.

The airport is very old and small. Border and baggage claim are in one room.

Since the country is small, car license plates are extremely short.

In the Caribbean you can sometimes find wooden houses, just like in the Russian provinces.

Let's take a ride around the island. St. Vincent is round in shape, but the road along the coast is not looped; there is a gap on the northern edge of the island near the volcano. Public transport in the form of inexpensive buses and minibuses is available. I went along the western coast of the island. Locals often ride as passengers in trucks, as in Cambodia and Laos.

The roads in St. Vincent are, for the most part, of terrible quality. Even in the capital (this shot was taken on the main street).

Outside the capital, at times the road turns into a dirt road.

But the views are beautiful. St. Vincent has many karst mountains, similar to Malaysia or southern Thailand.

School and schoolchildren. By the way, there are almost no white people in this country. 95% black or mulatto.

In the north-west of St. Vincent is Wallilabu Bay, where the movie "Pirates of the Caribbean" (the first part) was filmed.

From here I walked a bit through the neighboring villages. In villages they wash by hand in the river, like in Indonesia.
