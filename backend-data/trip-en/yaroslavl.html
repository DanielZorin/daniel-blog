<h1>Russia: Yaroslavl, Rostov</h1>
<i>17-18 October 2012</i>
<h2>Yaroslavl</h2>
<p>
Having visited many cities in central and northern Russia, I cannot say that in Yaroslavl I encountered something that I had never seen anywhere else before, but the city pleasantly stands out for its livability. The main street is similar to the main street of some city in the center of Europe. There’s even a mime (I saw it for the first time in Russia).

The embankment is polished.

<p>
There is a park on the Volga and Kotorosl spit.

<p>
On the stele in honor of the millennium of Yaroslavl, you can see where the sculptors had a lot of time on details, and where the deadline came and everything was completed on the last night.
<p/>

<p>
On top of the confluence there is a local Cathedral of Christ the Savior, which fits very well into the monument of another popular religion.

<p>
Red Square in Yaroslavl looks like this.

<p>
I continued the tradition and took a photo next to another monument to Lenin, which here points not forward, but to some small detail on the side at the top.

View from a thousand-ruble banknote. Previously, I only saw cities from small bills: 5, 50 and 100 rubles. We need to continue the tradition and go to Khabarovsk, the city with on the 5000 banknote.
<p/>

<p>
In terms of the number of decorations on the facades, Yaroslavl is not inferior to St. Petersburg.
<p/>

<p>
Most of all, the columns of the Corinthian order are held in high esteem here.
<p/>

Another feature of the city is the elaborate fences on the balconies.
<p/>

<p>
Like in Veliky Novgorod, there is a beach in the city center.
<p/>

And the obligatory acid-colored bench with an urn.

<p>
But here is a sign with peel-off letters, almost like in Staraya Russa. In Moscow, you can see a peeling sign on Novinsky Boulevard, but it’s not just individual letters that are stuck on, but the entire rectangle.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255022527_bbc51b04fa_o.jpg">

Epic sign.

The outskirts preserve a lot of interesting artifacts.

A Kooperator store was opened in our city.
You can cut the sausage into slices, or you can chop it with a shovel.
Girls come into the store, they really like the sausage,
So tasty and long, not a sausage, but just a fairy tale. <i>Song by the band "Nol"</i>

The bazaar is in the very center of the city, just like in Morocco.

Yaroslavl is a stronghold of the opposition. Here United Russia has the lowest rating, and they are not shy about hanging Navalny’s slogans on the walls.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256796135_5f2bdc61af_o.jpg">
<p>
No exit.

<p>
Local authorities, meanwhile, are extremely concerned about falling icicles, so they post warnings on every house.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255022572_34d2b02b77_o.jpg">
<p>
Not everyone shares this concern.

On the opposite side of the river there is nothing particularly interesting at first glance. Well, abandoned rails.
<p/>

The most interesting thing is revealed when viewed from above.

<h2>Rostov</h2>
<p>
Here it is, Mother Russia: weeds, a path, and multi-colored domes on the horizon.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254643237_7c14f5e424_o.jpg">
<p>
Rostov is fabulous and delightful. The Rostov Kremlin is technically not a Kremlin at all (it is a monastery, not a fortress), but it's not worse than any Kremlin.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256122654_e7daaa96e9_o.jpg">
<p>
When I come here again (and someday I will probably return), I will try to stay in the hotel located right inside the Kremlin, for the sake of authenticity.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255578638_bed0ac1489_o.jpg">
<p>
The feeling of fabulousness arises due to the very high concentration of domes.
<p/>

<p>
There are so many of them that at least a dozen can be seen from any angle.

<p>
Rostov also has another side. The border between them runs exactly in the middle of this street.
<p/>
