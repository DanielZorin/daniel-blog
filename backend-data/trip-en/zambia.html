<h1>Zambia: Lusaka, Livingstone</h1>
<i>2-4 February 2024</i>
<h2>Lusaka</h2>
<p>
Zambia is a fairly large country in the interior of the African continent. There were no big wars or economic disasters here, like in Zimbabwe, everything is calm and quiet. The capital of Zambia is called Lusaka, it is a large city with a population of one and a half million. But from the inside it doesn’t feel big: there is only a small commercial and administrative area, and a huge amount of one-story buildings, in general, much like in Harare - I began to notice a trend in African urban planning.

<p>
I checked into the hotel called Lusaka backpackers. Costs about $14, inexpensive (although in golden times in Thailand I would consider it expensive).

<p>
According to the map, it seems that it is very close to the center, but in fact it is 2 kilometers away. This street is also a dead end, if there were a passage it would be closer.

<p>
The night before I arrived from Zimbabwe at 9pm as the bus was much slower than I thought. From the bus station I took a taxi through the Yango app for a dollar, before that I also had time to eat at a fast food restaurant, since I had not eaten anything since the morning.

<p>
Hungry Lion is a very popular chain in all countries in this region. In fact, the food is very similar to KFC, even the taste of the chicken is close.

Prices ($1 = 27 kwacha). The four piece combo is $4, cheap.

<p>
In Zambia, houses are fenced with electric current or barbed wire, as in South Africa. But this city doesn’t seem to be that dangerous; I walked around calmly during the day.

There was a real Indian ashram next to the hotel. Zambia has migrants from India and China.

The landscapes of Lusaka at times look like remote parts of Moscow.

Instead of garages, there are these stalls where you can top up your mobile phone account.

<p>
There are huge ditches in Lusaka, perhaps they flood here during the rainy season (although I was there during the rainy season, but it was dry).

<p>
Although it is written that you cannot litter, enter without permission and urinate, this is exactly what everyone does.

And the quality of the goods here is clearly higher. You can buy delicious steaks, by the way, very cheaply - only 6 dollars per kilogram.
<p/>

<h2>Road</h2>
<p>
I traveled more than 500 kilometers in Zambia from Lusaka to Livingstone. The roads in this direction are quite good.
<p/>

The first thing that catches your eye after the border is the huge number of booths where you can top up your phone balance.

<p>
I went to Livingston on a bus from a company with the funny name "Shalom". A ticket costs about $12.

<p>
Unlike Zimbabwe, where the conductor marks passengers' seats on paper, there is a computer-based ticket booking system. They christened me Dannel Z, and I also became a Zambian, although they didn’t issue me a passport.

<p>
The ZZZambian patriot got on the bus. By the way, the bus is quite cramped, since there are not four seats in a row, as usual, but five.

<p>
When we reached the city of Choma, the bus broke down. The company representative apologized and said that a backup bus from Livingston had left for us, but the wait would be at least two hours. I decided not to wait and bought a ticket for a bus from another company that was leaving in 10 minutes. Although it was about 1/3 of the way to Livingston, the ticket cost 2/3 of the full ticket from Lusaka. Choma bus station:

<h2>Livingstone</h2>
<p>
The city of Livingstone is located near Victoria Falls on the Zambian side. Unlike the small purely tourist town on the Zimbabwean side, Livingstone is not that small a city, with a population of almost 200 thousand. Until 2011 it was the capital of the province, and until 1935 it was the capital of all of colonial Zambia (Northern Rhodesia).

<p>
I chose a hotel closer to the center, but it was still a 20-minute walk, although according to the map it seemed like a stone's throw. Oh, these car cities, in Africa, in this regard, it's just like in America. Street with my hotel:

<h2>Victoria Falls</h2>
<p>
Victoria Falls is one of the most famous attractions in all of Africa. It is curious that the three most famous waterfalls are all located on the borders of two countries: Iguazu in <a href="../argentina">Brazil and Argentina</a>, Niagara in <a href="../atlanta">USA</a> and <a href="../ontario">Canada</a>, and Victoria on the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe. It seems that the vast majority of tourists in both countries only visit the falls, fortunately there are airports on both sides of the border, and there are quite a few flights there from South Africa. Well, I passed a long road of 1000 kilometers through both capitals to get here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537210998_3d8ac26f5d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The first European to visit this waterfall was Livingstone (after whom the city is named). Near the entrance there is a monument to Henry Stanley, who found the missing Livingstone. Though, it was not here, but in Tanzania.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537347429_b0ff4dd20e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Entry from Zambia costs $20. I arrived at the opening, and at first I explored the waterfall alone; later tourists began to arrive, including those from across the border from Zimbabwe.
<p/>

<p>
This is what the Zambezi River looks like from above. There is a cliff on the left - this is the waterfall.

<p/>

<p>
The river forms a deep gorge, which meanders for a long time after the waterfall. Gradually the waterfall moves further, lengthening the gorge.
<p/>

<p>
Unlike Iguazu, which can be viewed both from above and from below, here all the viewpoints are only from above, approximately at the same level from where the water falls.
<p/>

<p>
That is, you are standing on the other side of the gorge, and the waterfall is right in front of you. It’s not like in Niagara, where you can see the entire waterfall from afar from the other side. In addition, Victoria is much wider than Niagara.

<p>
Since the waterfall is very close, a cloud of spray flies from it. I even took a raincoat with me, but overall it wasn’t that bad. As a result, of course, I got soaked wet, but then I quickly dried out in the sun, and it turned out to be quite normal to photograph.

Victoria Falls is very seasonal. In winter, during the rainy season, it increases, reaching a peak somewhere in February-March (I was there in February). And in the summer it almost dries out, so you can see more of the rock.

The rock on the left is the observation point from the Zimbabwean side.

<p>
There the observation deck is longer, about 2/3 of the length of the waterfall is on that side. But in general, the view there is about the same, only mirrored. However, admission there is much more expensive - as much as $50.

On the back side of the rock you can see a bridge - you can cross the border on it, just like in Niagara (while on Iguazu there is no bridge overlooking the waterfall).

You can get closer to the bridge.

Along the way you can see the waterfall from afar.

You can go down to the river here through the forest, but it is not a very short trek.

A flock of baboons lives near the entrance.

<p>
Baboons are similar to Asian macaques, only probably five times larger. It was scary to walk past them, I photographed only the females, and the males were even larger.
