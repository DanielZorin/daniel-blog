<h2>Antalya</h2>
<p>
In March in Antalya there was a concert of my favorite band “Nogu Svolo!”, which I could not miss. Since the concert ended late, I rented a hotel nearby for one night, and at the same time saw some more sights of Antalya.

<p>
The concert was, as always, excellent.

For the second encore, they sang the song “Huy”.

I finally reached the upper Duden waterfall. The lower one falls directly into the sea in the Lara area, and the upper one is located far in the depths of the residential area of ​​​​Kepez. You can get there by tram (the station is called “waterfall” / şelale) along the second line, which I have never used before. From the tram stop it’s another 20 minutes on foot.

Bats live in caves nearby (however, I don’t have to travel that far for bats - they also live under the roof of my house).

Through the cave you can go behind the wall of the waterfall.
