<h1>Russia: Kalyazin, Starobislovo</h1>
<i>13 August 2021</i>
<h2>Kalyazin</h2>
<p>
The city of Kalyazin is located in the far edge of the Tver region, not far from the borders with Moscow and Yaroslavl. It is closer to Moscow than to Tver - after Sergiev Posad the road branches to Kalyazin and Yaroslavl. This is another city on the Volga, famous mainly for its bell tower in the middle of the river.

<p>
During Soviet times, most of the old Kalyazin was flooded, but the bell tower of the cathedral is so high that it remained above the water level.

<h2>Starobislovo</h2>
<p>
I went to Kalyazin for a reason, because I wanted to visit places in the area where my grandmother was born.

To do this, you need to turn off the main road to Kalyazin and drive along a very bad country road through fields overgrown with hogweed.

Starobislovo is a relatively large village, population is more than 100 people, and it is the center of the Starobislovo Rural Settlement within the Kalyazin District. There was once a school here. When I was little, 3-7 years old, I used to come here in the summer and remember the school at this end of the village, but now it’s gone.

There are many decent houses. In general, there is a second road from the north, which is nominally a little longer, but the quality is much better.

My grandmother was born in Starobislovo in 1925, she had three brothers and a sister, one brother died in the War, two died in the late 80s - early 90s, and I still remember her sister as a child. Around the 1930s, my great-grandmother and her family moved to Moscow, but their old house did not survive, and this house was bought much later, somewhere in the 1970s, when my great-grandmother retired.
<p/>

The house was then renovated by my grandfather.
