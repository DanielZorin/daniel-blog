<h1>Gambia: Serekunda, Banjul</h1>
<i>5-6 August 2024</i>
<h2>Serekunda</h2>
<p>
Gambia is a small country occupying a strip of land along the river of the same name. The British colonized this piece of land, surrounded on both sides by French territories (modern Senegal). The population and tourists are concentrated near the mouth of this river, where there are beaches on the Atlantic Ocean.

<p>
The largest city is called Serekunda. It has an airport and most of the beaches (the beaches continue to the neighboring city of Sukuta, but for simplicity I will not separate them). The hotel was slightly off the main road in a residential area. It looks like this.

<p>
Not bad, but when it started to rain, it was difficult to get around the puddles and wet clay.

<p>
Gambian dalasi. Mostly new, but there are old worn-out bills with the previous president Yahya Jammeh, who ruled from 1996 to 2017. Then he lost the election, but decided not to leave. In the end, everyone was so fed up with him that the union of West African countries led by Senegal sent troops to Gambia and overthrew him.

The beach is about 5 kilometers from the main street. I went out onto a large highway running along the sea and assessed the situation.

<p>
There are no buses here, but periodically cars stopped at the side of the road and someone got on. In the end, I also jumped into such a car and got to the beach for a very small amount (less than $0.30).

<h2>Banjul</h2>
<p>
The capital of Gambia is located on a small island at the mouth of the river. Due to the fact that there is nowhere to grow, the city remains compact, in fact, all the growth is happening in Serekunda.

Then I had to cross the Gambia River by ferry. The river is very wide, the ferry takes about 40 minutes. They are supposed to go every half hour, but the boats are constantly breaking down, so I waited for about two hours.

<p>
Finally, the ferry departed. There are also these fast mini ferries, I should have gone on one, instead of crowding in the heat. But no one on the other side offered me one, and I didn't immediately find a way through the shopping arcades to the big ferry.

The border between Gambia and Senegal is legendarily trashy, some say it's the worst border in West Africa. That's one of the reasons (besides speed) I flew to Gambia. But the way back was fun too. About 15 kilometers before the border, there was a checkpoint. There, the men from our shared taxi were sent for inspection (women and children were ignored). I had the biggest backpack, which the officers inspected thoroughly for drugs, pulling everything out to the very bottom. When they found a bag of medicine at the bottom, they said that in Gambia you must have a prescription for all medicines, tsk-tsk-tsk. I read about this scam, that they extort money like this when entering from Senegal at customs. I reacted somehow very indifferently, like "come on sir, it can't be". And in the end they didn't insist, they just gave me all my things and let me go.
At the border itself they took me to a Gambian security officer, who was sitting in a house in the back of the border checkpoint. We had a heart-to-heart talk about life. He quickly figured out that I was lying in response to his question about whether I liked Putin. I had to sing "I am Russian" to be convincing. After that they let me go and I went to Senegal.
