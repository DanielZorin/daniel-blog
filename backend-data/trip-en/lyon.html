<h1>France: Lyon, Annecy, Chamonix</h1>
<i>13-16 November 2019</i>
<h2>Lyon</h2>
<p>
Traveling around France has long been in my plans. When it came time to get a Schengen visa, I planned a trip there for a couple of weeks to see regions where I had not been before, Later, a few days in Switzerland were added to the plan so that there would be no blank spots in this country either. Arriving in Paris, I immediately boarded a high-speed train at the airport and went to the second city of France - Lyon. In France, high-speed low-cost trains have appeared, using the infrastructure of normal trains, but with typical low-cost restrictions: for example, you can only take one bag with you. They also use non-central stations, so in Paris trains stop at the airport and in Marne-la-Vallee (near Disneyland), and in Lyon - also at the airport. And so I found myself at Lyon Antoine de Saint-Exupéry airport without flying.

Getting out of the airport is a tricky task. Some years ago the "market" decided that a 15-minute train ride to the center of Lyon should cost almost 20 euros. And only in 2019 a bus route appeared, passing through the outskirts and industrial zones of Lyon with a stop at the airport; you can take it to the final tram stop for a normal price. Station in the industrial zone:

<p>
In addition to the tram, Lyon has a metro, a fairly developed system of four lines. I took it all the time, since the city is quite large.

The day pass also allows you to travel on other types of transport, such as the funicular that has two lines leading to the top of the mountain in the city center.

Lyon stands at the confluence of the Rhone and Saône rivers. The city center (19th century) is on a long and narrow peninsula between the rivers, and the old city is on the other bank of the Saône. On the other side of the Rhone are newer business and residential areas. The old town is a narrow strip, sandwiched between the river and a high hill, on top of which stands the Fourvière Basilica.

The most unusual thing here is the passages between the main streets through the courtyards of residential buildings - in French they are called Traboules.

It turns out that inside behind the facades there are sometimes small labyrinths and many stairs.

In old Lyon, three traboules were deliberately left open for tourists, although the internal staircases, of course, are closed there too.

<h2>Annecy</h2>
<p>
From Lyon I was going to go to the city of Grenoble, but it snowed that day. It turned out that snowfall in the city where the Winter Olympic Games were held was a complete force majeure; neither buses nor trains went to Grenoble. After hanging out at Lyon stations for half a day, I left very late by train for Annecy (where I planned to spend the night). Annecy turned out to be a very nice town near a lake at the foot of the mountains.

<h2>Chamonix</h2>
<p>
From Annecy I took a bus even higher - to Chamonix, the capital of the first Winter Olympics. Officially, the city is called Chamonix-Mont-Blanc in honor of the nearby Mont Blanc mountain - the highest point in Europe (except for <a href="http://goo.gl/ZYifpt">Caucasus</a>).

Cable car to the southern peak (Aigulle du Midi) near Mont Blanc. From there there is also a continuation to the other side of the mountain range into Italy. A ride on this cable car is a very expensive pleasure, only the first stage costs more than 50 euros one way, and to Italy the total will be about 130.
