<h1>Argentina: Buenos Aires, La Plata</h1>
<i>7-10 January 2013</i>
<h2>Buenos Aires</h2>
<p>
Is it true that people dance tango in the streets in Argentina? Not really, tango is danced only in Buenos Aires, because there are a lot of tourists there.

<p>
Buenos Aires is square in its squareness. The streets are laid out in a smooth grid. As in other countries of South America (as well as in Germany), it is not the houses that are numbered, but the entrances. For greater convenience, after each intersection the numbering begins with the next hundred, that is, the 262nd house can immediately be followed by the 300th.

<p>
Remember: the Malvinas Islands were, are and will be Argentine while we live in a tent in the central square!

A memorial with an outline of the islands and a list of those killed is an indispensable attribute of the Argentine city.

<p>
The Falkland Islands War is a typical example of a “short victorious war”. Argentina's military junta has decided to boost its flagging popularity, but has chosen the wrong opponent. However, all the swindlers and thieves who have ruled Argentina since then continued to persistently use this topic to their advantage. Recently, the president bashed England again. In general, swindlers and thieves in power are a typical situation in Argentina. Discussions about the mass shootings that took place after the 1976 coup are now very popular. There is even an organization of mothers of those executed, whose logo is painted many times on the tiles near the presidential palace.

<p>
Near many houses in Buenos Aires there are memorial tiles embedded in the ground.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255243892_94c66e6a83_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The tiles tell the story of the victims of the 1976 repressions who lived on this site.

It is customary here to hang advertisements for prostitutes in orderly rows, turned at a slight angle. On the walls.
<p/>

There are often water taps near the ground, from which buckets are filled for cleaning doors and windows.

It's a scary profession to walk with other people's dogs. It’s good that there is at least a fenced enclosure for this.

The metro in Buenos Aires is quite beautiful.

On one of the lines there are still old trains with wooden benches.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256722979_a5b12e0abc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And in the turnstiles there are wooden sticks.

On police cars, the word “police” is reflected so that you can see in the rearview mirror who is following you.

Typical shelves in an Argentine supermarket. I did not like the selection and prices of products compared to Brazil.
<p/>

Price tags. Of course, it’s immediately clear what it costs.

Is it true that there are no blacks in Argentina? True, but then there are Paraguayans and Bolivians.

<p>
Let's walk through the districts of Buenos Aires. Unfortunately, I didn’t go to the most interesting area - Villa 31, a huge slum in the heart of the city. No one knows for sure what is going on there. They say it's trash, insanity and sodomy.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256173738_44c9b33185_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I lived in the San Telmo area, which was quite good.
<p/>

<p>
Tango dances in the streets, there is a fair on Sundays, picturesque mountains of old stuff.

San Telmo is beautiful with drawings on the walls, you need to see them.

In the center on Florida Street they exchange dollars for pesos at a black market rate, almost one and a half times higher than the official one. Another manifestation of the Argentine economic miracle. At night, multi-colored cubes glow above the street.

The tomb of San Martin, the liberator of Argentina from the Spanish colonialists, is similar to the tomb of Napoleon Bonaparte in Paris.

In both places, the names of the sites of the most famous battles won by the commander are written in a circle.

The narrow passages make you feel like you are in a labyrinth of crypts.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257016920_1cbdf94368_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Some crypts are poorly maintained and covered in dust and cobwebs.

Somewhere in the same area is El Ateneo, a very beautiful bookstore located in the theater building.

La Boca, here on the main street in every house there is a souvenir shop, and a bunch of excursion buses with tourists.

Around the corner there is no one but homeless people, and there are no colorful houses.

After I left Buenos Aires, I read that the city is very dangerous, you can only go to San Telmo during the day and very carefully, to La Boca only by bus with a tour, you get robbed in the metro, they rob you at the station and etc. Good thing I didn't read this *before*.
</p>
<h2>La Plata</h2>
<p>
I definitely wanted to visit the city of La Plata. How could you not want to after seeing the city plan? In such a geometrically perfect city, everything should be beautiful, everything should bloom brightly and delight the heart.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257396155_512513d6a6_h.jpg"/>

<p>
You can get to La Plata in about an hour by train for 30 rubles, and in the same amount of time by bus, but five times more expensive. The path passes through the pampas. It sounds romantic but it looks quite ordinary.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256355486_84e4188380_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At the entrance to La Plata you can see a ring of dirty slums.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257101849_79b597fbff_h.jpg"/>
<p>
As the map promises, the streets intersect at right angles and are called numbers.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257101894_276e125b31_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In theory, streets have normal names, but they are not used.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257396310_e53e6a2aad_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Despite the layout, it is easy to lose your way, because the city is very gray and monotonous.
<p/>

<p>
Typical street of La Plata. To its credit, compared to typical Russian town, there are a lot of trees and cars are not parked on the sidewalk. But there is a gray fence and bad tiles.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257102109_0652365011_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The central square and several streets around it are beautiful; government institutions are concentrated there. The plebs are left to live in concrete boxes.
<p/>

In La Plata, newspapers are interestingly sold in kiosks, rolled into tubes and laid out in rows.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256355621_510443110d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is nothing else interesting in La Plata, so a little politics for starters.
<p/>

<p>
The traditional call is to return the Malvinas, as well as to throw out all the foreign tourists from Iguazu National Park.

An interesting word is “femicide.” Freedom fighters need to take action.

<p>
Interestingly, the current government emphasizes continuity with the leaders of the juntas that have ruled the country since independence. So that everyone knows that there is no alternative, 146% in the elections is guaranteed. It’s time for our Khans to adopt this technique and paint themselves on posters together with the kings and general secretaries, it’s more honest.
