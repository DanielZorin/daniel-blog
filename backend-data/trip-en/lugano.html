<h1>Switzerland: Lugano, Melide, Chiasso</h1>
<i>5 March 2014</i>
<h2>Lugano</h2>
<p>
Switzerland, as usual, is very nice, very cozy and very expensive.

Lugano is located in the only canton where the main language is Italian, but the format of infrastructure facilities here is no different from <a href="../switzerland">German Switzerland</a>. The photo shows something unheard of - a train in Switzerland is two minutes late (pay attention to the scoreboard and the clock).

<p>
The lake near which the city stands is Lake Lugano.

<p>
Buses go to this mountain along serpentine roads.

<p>
In Lugano, unlike Zurich or Lucerne, high mountains are very close, visible from almost everywhere.

Cute and very expensive.

There is a funicular to the station.

<h2>Melide</h2>
<p>
This village is good because from here you can see almost all parts of Lake Lugano.

This photo shows the town of Campione d'Italia, a small enclave of Italy surrounded on all sides by Swiss territory.

Unfortunately, transport doesn’t go there very often, and the fare zone there is different than in Melide, so I didn’t go. However, there is hardly anything interesting there, except perhaps out of curiosity to find out whether there is customs control at the border of the enclave.

Melide consists of only a few streets, but there is even a tourist route and maps and signs posted here.

Melide station proves that even in Switzerland someone pisses in underground passages.

<p>
It also offers views of Monte San Giorgio, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which is also unclear why it is on this list.

The mountain is notable for the fact that fossils have been preserved there, and in appearance it is no different from other mountains in the neighborhood. But you never know where fossil animals are found?

<h2>Chiasso</h2>
<p>
This is a small town on the Italian border.
<p/>

<p>
This is the actual border.

When leaving for Italy, customs officers frisked me, searching every pocket in my backpack. What they were looking for there and why is a mystery. What is the general point of customs inspection at exit, and even between Switzerland and Italy? What profit can you make by transporting more than 10,000 euros in cash there?
