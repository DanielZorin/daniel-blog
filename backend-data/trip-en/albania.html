<h1>Albania: Shkoder, Tirana, Durres</h1>
<i>1-3 July 2014</i>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>
The history of Albania is so epic that it deserves a separate discussion.
Albanians are descendants of the ancient population of the Balkans, who were there before the Romans and Slavs. Albania is located in a remote corner of Europe and consists mostly of impassable mountains, so this territory was not of great interest to the big powers, which is why it retained its population in both Byzantium and Turkey. Albanian nationalism emerged in the late 19th century, as in other countries in the region. The Albanians were Muslims and could not act in an alliance with Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece against Turkey, in addition, there were serious fears that the Serbs and Greeks would take away a significant part of the territory of Albania. Therefore, Albania became independent only in 1912 after the defeat of Turkey in the First Balkan War. Then the independence of Albania was supported by the Great Powers™, apparently in order to prevent the strengthening of Serbia and Greece. The Albanians offered the English MP Aubrey Herbert to become king for supporting independence, but the Prime Minister did not allow it, and the German nobleman Wilhelm Wied became king.

Less than two years after independence, the Great Powers simply abandoned Albania, by secret agreement giving it under the protectorate of Italy in exchange for the latter joining the Entente. The northern part of Albania, meanwhile, was occupied by the Austrians. After the end of the war, Albania began to be divided by Yugoslavia and Italy. Initially, the British and French were going to surrender Albania, but under the influence of the United States they changed their minds, maintaining Albania's independence. At that moment, the country was undergoing a sluggish civil war and a chain of coups d'etat, which eventually brought Ahmed Zogu to power. Zogu became the President of the Republic of Albania with almost unlimited powers, but this was not enough for him, and three years later he dissolved the parliament and declared himself King Zog the First.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the Adriatic, Mussolini looked at this circus and thought through a cunning plan for the occupation of Albania. The Italians really liked the city of Vlorë because it would allow them to control the entrance to the Adriatic Sea on both sides. Like any dictator, Zog did not have many options for maintaining himself in power. He decided to use Italy for protection, in return he would allow the Italians to extract resources in Albania, took loans from them, in general, turned his country into a colony. Then he abandoned them in favor of Yugoslavia and Greece. When Chamberlain and Daladier were giving Czechoslovakia to Hitler, Mussolini realized that now anything was possible and sent troops into Albania. Zog I went to London and Paris to ponder about the old days in solitude. Albania found itself under occupation first by Italy, then by Germany. When it seemed that the country had reached the bottom, there was a knock from below, and the communists came to Albania.

Profound poverty, cattlification of the population, concentration camps, mass executions, paranoia - all these indispensable attributes of the communist state were present in Albania. Enver Hoxha took the idea to the point of complete absurdity, first breaking ties with Yugoslavia (for Tito’s betrayal of the ideas of communism), then with the USSR (for Khrushchev’s betrayal of the ideas of communism), and then with China (for Deng Xiaoping’s betrayal of the ideas of communism). There was an obsession in the country - there are enemies all around, we must prepare for war. At every corner they built underground bunkers for the partisans. The fight against religion was taken to the limit: according to Lenin’s behests, Albania was declared the world’s first atheistic state.

<p>
Albanian communism had another interesting feature. Usually in commie countries they try to completely destroy national culture (examples: USSR, China), but in Albania communism had a strong nationalist bias. It was then that they began to come up with an alternative history of Albania, where it was a thousand-year-old state, tracing its ancestry from the Illyrians, a people who lived in the Balkans during the times of Ancient Greece; moreover, they argued that Albania, and not Greece at all, is the heir of Ancient Greece. This reminds me of something.
Communism in Albania was finally abolished in 1992. Albania was the poorest and most backward country in Europe, so if Hoxha's successor had been a great dictator, he would have had a chance to build an analogue of North Korea, but it didn't work out. And so, when the communists brought the country to the very bottom, the liberals came knocking from below.

The new democratic authorities of Albania had a very unique concept of capitalism. They firmly believed in the invisible hand of the market, and therefore considered it beneath their dignity to somehow regulate the economy. They had more important things to do, for example, lustrating former communists who had renamed themselves socialists. Ex-prime minister and socialist leader Fatos Nano was arrested and spent several years in prison awaiting trial. Having looked at the successes of his Russian colleague in 1993, Albanian Yeltsin Sali Berisha decided to make a similar constitution for himself, but suddenly something went wrong and the people voted against it in a referendum. Taking into account the mistakes, the ruling circles in 1996 had already successfully rigged parliamentary elections, so that the socialists, who received only 10 seats out of 140, even boycotted them.
Meanwhile, everything was very cheerful in the economy. The country lived from two sources: transfers of Albanian migrant workers and arms smuggling to Yugoslavia in circumvention of the embargo. There was no banking system or market within the country; the entire economy was informal and controlled by mafia and clan structures. Instead of banks, there were a dozen organizations that “invested” money mainly in smuggling. When the war in Bosnia ended in 1996, Albanian “banks” turned into Ponzi scheme pyramids (and some were to begin with). To keep from bankruptcy, they began to raise rates, 5-6-8-10 percent per month. The scale of Ponzi scheme in Albania was unprecedented: two-thirds of the population kept money in pyramids, many sold all their property. At the beginning of 1997, the pyramids went bankrupt one after another.
<i>(In Albania you can still find a security system at the entrance of banks, like in <a href="../rio-de-janeiro">Brazil</a>.)</i >

Albania consists of two parts - the liberal north and the conservative south. After the collapse of the economy, it was the south, which supported the socialists, that became the center of the uprising demanding the return of lost deposits and the overthrow of the government. Unlike Yeltsin in 1993, Berisha did not have the overwhelming advantage in force that would have allowed him to shoot demonstrators. Numerous weapons warehouses left over from communist times were looted, and civil war began in the country. At a critical moment, the government managed to turn to foreign countries for help in time, and was able to avoid surrendering the capital to the rebels. They agreed to hold new elections, but the redistribution of property continued for several more months; the country was essentially controlled by gangs. The Democratic Party lost the elections, the situation began to stabilize. The Socialist leader was released from prison and became Prime Minister. In 1998, Albania finally had a constitution. The country began to rise from its knees. In 2005, Sali Berisha, thrown out previously, returned to power as prime minister, and remained in this post until 2013. In 2009, Albania joined NATO, and this year officially became a candidate for EU membership. A celebration was held regarding the EU candidacy: they closed the Tirana art museum, fenced off the roadway and organized a banquet for respectable gentlemen, while people watched the fireworks from the lawn.

<h2>Shkodër</h2>
<p>
Albania is the only country in the world, besides Russia, where trees are painted white.
<p/>

<p>
Only in Albania: they made a fountain in the square, placed benches around it, but forgot to make a transition across the road to the benches.

<p>
In all Albanian cities there are incredible concentrations of wires, apparently from the times when everyone stole electricity.
<p/>

There is Islam in Albania, and occasionally you can see women in hijabs.

<p>
The communist-era monuments are in poor condition and no one looks after them.

<p>
After wandering around different streets, I finally found the central street of Shkodër. The contrast with the rest of the city is stark.

<p>
And this is what this street looked like before restoration, and this is how its second half still looks.
<p/>

On the parallel street everything is as usual.

<p>
Albanian police officers wear exactly the same uniform as Russian ones. Only with the Albanian coat of arms on the patch.

<p>
Instead of monuments to Lenin in Albania, in all cities there are monuments to Mother Teresa, who was ethnic Albanian (born in the territory of modern country of Macedonia).

<p>
Contrary to the popular stereotype that Albanians = gypsies, in appearance the people here are similar to the inhabitants of other countries of southern Europe (Greece, Italy, Spain, etc.)

<h2>Durrës</h2>
<p>
Albania boasts the worst public transport system in Europe. At the Tirana tourist information center they gave me a map of the city, printed on a black and white printer, and an A4 piece of paper with minibus schedules. The minibus to Durrës, judging by the map, should go from the market. I walked around the entire market, but couldn’t find a minibus. I started asking passers-by where the minibus to Durrës was, and they told me to go down the street. I'm walking, there are no minibuses. I ask a grandmother who sells newspapers, and she replies: everything is correct, then turn into an alley and walk through the courtyards. Indeed, in one of the side streets there was a minibus, which took me to Durrës in half an hour! People ride standing, in the best traditions of Central Asia.

Here you can understand what amphitheaters in Spain, Italy and other countries would look like if they had not been restored.

Durrës is a seaside city, but to get the beach you have to go further from the center.

For example, there are bicycles for rent. Fashionable payment terminals are not available here; you need to take them manually from the girl at the counter.

There are book stalls all over the city. You can buy "Mein Kampf" in Albanian, but I didn't buy it again (I previously saw this book in <a href="../paraguay">Paraguay</a> and <a href="../washington">USA</a>), because I was too lazy to carry it in my backpack.

Next to the failed Hoxha Museum is the Blloku, a quarter where communist leaders once lived and where ordinary people were prohibited from entering. Now it is the party zone in the city. Here I discovered the Albanian Fried Chicken restaurant.
