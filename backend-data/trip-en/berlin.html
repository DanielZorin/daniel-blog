<h1>Germany: Berlin, Potsdam, Oranienburg</h1>
<i>8-11 February 2015</i>
<h2>Berlin</h2>
<p>
There are countries where it is impossible to travel past the capital. For example, <a href="../hungary">Hungary</a> or <a href="../../country/france">France< /a>. There are countries where tourists rarely visit the capital, for example, <a href="../../country/turkey">Turkey</a> and <a href="../croatia">Croatia</a>. Germany cannot be classified in either the first or second category. Somehow it turned out that in four trips to Germany I had never been to its capital, so Berlin remained the biggest gap in Europe for me. Since tickets due to the fall in the ruble exchange rate began to cost 25 euros, cheaper than to Budapest, it was not difficult to fill the gap.

Most of Berlin's attractions appeared in the 20th century and do not fall into the category of beauty. These are places of memory of the Third Reich and traces of the Cold War. Berlin was home to government buildings where figures such as Goebbels and Himmler worked. After the city was stormed in 1945 and bombed, many of these buildings burned down, but some remained. The block of pompous, huge buildings south of the Brandenburg Gate is it.

All that was left of the Gestapo building was the foundation on which a pavilion with an exhibition was built.

The most interesting monument of that era is preserved in the northern suburb of Berlin, Oranienburg.

This is the former Sachsenhausen concentration camp. The most famous prisoner of this camp was Martin Niemöller, the one who coined the words:<br>
<i>
When the Nazis came for the communists, I was silent, I’m not a communist.<br>
Then they came for the Social Democrats, I was silent, I’m not a Social Democrat.<br>
Then they came for the trade unionists, I was silent, I’m not a trade union member.<br>
Then they came for the Jews, I was silent, I’m not a Jew.<br>
And then they came for me, and there was no one left to protest<br>
</i>

Sachsenhausen looks about the same as <a href="../munich">Dachau</a>.

In place of the barracks there were heaps of rubble.

<p>
The first experiments in mass murder were conducted here. They came up with a special wall with holes, on which a length scale was depicted. The victims were, as it were, brought to the wall to have their height measured, and the SS man sitting behind the wall shot them in the back of the head.

All that was left of the building where this happened was the foundation.
<p/>

And the ruins of the crematorium.

The place is gloomy.

<p>
At the same time, the city of Oranienburg itself is not at all gloomy, but very nice.

For some reason, all the transformers here have ads.

After the war, Berlin was divided into four occupation zones. According to the Potsdam agreements, Germany was supposed to remain united after the end of the occupation, but the USSR was in no hurry to withdraw its troops from the east, and the Americans, respectively, from West Berlin and West Germany. At one time, the USSR tried to blockade West Berlin, closing travel there by land, but the Americans were able to supply the city with airplanes. At that time, communism began to be built in the GDR. As always, there were not enough people who wanted to build communism; there was no enthusiasm. People lived in East Berlin, where there was free education and low prices, and went to work for the capitalists. All reasonable people guessed that such life would end sooner or later, and sought to move to the west while it was still possible. Berlin was a hole in this regard: the main border between the GDR and the Federal Republic of Germany was closed, but it was possible to get into West Berlin and from there fly to West Germany. From 1945 to 1961, 20% of the population left the GDR; way more than Yeltsin-Putin Russia so far. One fine day, the rulers of the GDR decided to put an end to this and built a wall around West Berlin.

<p>
Everyone who thought: “They won’t do anything, I’ll still have time to leave, if anything happens,” screwed up big time and spent the next 28 years in a communist concentration camp.

<p>
The wall fell apart when Hungary opened its borders, so it became possible to travel along the GDR-Hungary-Austria-West Germany route.

<p>
The wall was dismantled for souvenirs, which increase in value over the years. Many pieces are placed in different cities, and in Berlin itself in many places.

For Americans, this is as important as the inscriptions of Soviet soldiers on the walls of the Reichstag are for us. This is a symbol of their victory over communism.

In East Germany they built approximately the same Soviet buildings as in all other Warsaw Pact countries.

Commie-style buildings were shoved into the historical center, such as this building in Potsdam.

Oddly enough, in Germany there are also those who are nostalgic for the GDR, although there the standard of living has increased 10000000000000000 times compared to the Soviet Union. Apparently they didn’t fit into the market economy.

As it turned out, there is still a monument to Gorbachev on Earth. Of course, such a thing will never be installed in Russia, but in Germany it is already installed.
<p/>

More precisely, a monument to all three people who had a hand in the destruction of the Berlin Wall.

February is low season in Berlin and there are relatively few people. There is only a small party at the gate.

Everything is closed on Sunday evening. Only this Turkish shawarma shop was open.

It turned out that this was a famous establishment; Merkel and Kohl had been here.

I ordered the main Berlin dish - curry sausage.

I thought there would be few people in the Reichstag/Bundestag at 9 pm just before closing, but this turned out not to be the case.

Unfortunately, there were no tours of the building as the parliamentary session was in progress.

But most look like some kind of squats. And not even in the eastern part, but in the western part too.

Out of curiosity, I went to look at the Hufeisensiedlung (horseshoe house) quarter, which is a UNESCO heritage site.

In the Berlin metro you can immediately notice that it is very old, almost like in <a href="../paris">Paris</a> or <a href="../london">London</a>.

The windows of the trains are filled with the Brandenburg Gate, in fact this emblem is everywhere here.

Berlin has two more symbols. Firstly, the bear is in the "Preved" pose. <i>reference to a Russian meme</i>
<p/>

Secondly, the little man in the traffic light hat. He even has a name - Ampelmann.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256965895_0eaa8bb1fb_h.jpg"/>

There are even special shops selling Ampelmann souvenirs.

Chessbox club. This is such an unusual sport: first they play chess for 3 minutes, then they stand up and box for 3 minutes, then they play chess again, and so on. The one who checkmates or knocks out the opponent wins.

The Garrison Church, where Hitler held the ceremony in March 1933 in which Hindenburg appointed him chancellor (“Potsdam Day”), has not survived. Under Hitler, it was this event (and not the appointment of January 30 itself) that was considered the date of the beginning of the Third Reich, and the image of the church was printed on medals.

There is one unusual place in Potsdam - a Russian colony. 200 years ago, Russian soldiers who were captured by Napoleonic army settled here. After the war they were allowed to stay as a sign of friendship between Russia and Prussia. The colony was under the personal control of the king, and even during the Nazi era continued to exist until the arrival of the GDR. In Aleksandrovka there are traditional Russian huts.
