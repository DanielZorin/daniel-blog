<h1>Turkey: Trabzon, Erzurum, Van</h1>
<i>11-15 January 2022</i>
<h2>Trabzon</h2>
<p>
Traveling around Turkey, I couldn’t help but visit the eastern part, where there are no famous resorts and attractions, and travelers can be seen much less often. This is the poorer and more conservative part of the country. The northeast was once inhabited mainly by Armenians (before the genocide of 1915), and the southeast is still inhabited by Kurds, who have a conflict with the Turks, which is why checkpoints and military patrols are not uncommon in that region. But the first and main city of eastern Turkey where I flew, Trabzon, has a special history. It was a Byzantine city, which, being the capital of the separate Empire of Trebizond, lasted even a little longer than Constantinople. Now it is a large port on the Black Sea that lives by trade.

<p>
Trabzon is located in a rather picturesque place on the hills near the seashore. Though, there is a highway along the shore, and the embankment is only now being built in the area of ​​the new huge mosque.

<h2>Erzurum</h2>
<p>
From Trabzon I went inland to Erzurum. The road quickly climbs to the top and then crosses a plateau known as the Armenian Highlands.

Erzurum, like most cities in northeastern Turkey, had a large Armenian population before the 1915 genocide. After those events, the city became purely Turkish.

In Turkey, bus stations are located on some kind of outskirts, but Erzurum has surpassed everyone. Here the bus station is literally 10  kilometers away from the city, that is, you drive 10 kilometers by taxi just through a flat, empty field. What is the point of this is unclear.

Getting to Van turned out to be not so easy. The direct bus on the schedule did not depart from the bus station, but from some place indicated as “near the university,” who knows where that is. Therefore, I had to go crookedly - first to Bingöl, then to Muş, and from there to Tatvan.

<h2>Van</h2>
<p>
In the southeast of Turkey there is a rather large Lake Van. For some reason, it is so insurmountable that a railway has not yet been built around it (although the terrain there looks no different from the hundreds of kilometers around where there is a railway), so trains towards Iran are still carried across the lake on ferries. I also wanted to take a ferry ride, but it turned out that there are no passenger ferries in winter, and railway ferries operate very rarely. Therefore, I just had to travel along the shore by bus. To the west is the final point of the railways - the town of Tatvan, and to the east is the large city of Van.
<p/>

In Tatvan there are no hotels on Booking.com, I just walked into the first one I came across on the main street.

In Van there is a large castle on a rock on the shore of a lake. It is away from the modern city center, about five kilometers away.

The next morning, upon arriving at the airport, I learned that my flight to Istanbul had been rescheduled for late evening due to snowfall, like all other flights. Because of this, I missed the flight from Istanbul to Moscow; I had to spend the night in Istanbul and buy a new ticket.
