<h1>Russia: Galich, Sudislavl, Kostroma, Ivanovo, Kineshma</h1>
<i>11-13 August 2019</i>
<h2>Galich</h2>
<p>
A couple of hours drive from Kostroma is the ancient city of Galich. It is convenient to travel from Moscow due to the fact that some trains to Siberia (along the northern route of the Trans-Siberian Railway) stop here. This is further than Kostroma, and tourists clearly get here infrequently.

<p>
It seems that the building was the victim of a ridiculous reconstruction from Russian Railways.

<p>
Of all the historical small towns in Russia where I have been, Galich looks like one of the saddest. The roads are almost all broken; these days, contrary to stereotypes about Russia, such a picture is not so easy to see.

The main square has clearly not been touched since the 19th century, except that the asphalt was laid somewhere in the mid-20th.

As in many Russian cities, instead of fortress walls, earthen ramparts along the perimeter have been preserved.

A second fortress was built north of the city center on Balchug Hill in the 14th century, but was soon abandoned after being devastated during the civil war in the 15th century. I first tried to go up the seemingly short path, but the path there went through such tall and wet grass that I turned back.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256112426_b005a857db_o.jpg">

But I made a great shot at the top.

Though, the staircase itself is in dire need of repair; a quarter of the steps are broken.

A small part of the lake embankment has been landscaped. You can't get close to the shore, there's a lot of shallow water with grass.

<h2>Sudislavl</h2>
<p>
On the way to Kostroma, the bus stopped for about 30 minutes in an urban village called Sudislavl. The village turned out to be very picturesque, everything in it seemed to have been preserved untouched since the 19th century. And the most picturesque place is the church on the hill and the road to it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256611925_409f3b5257_o.jpg">
<p>
The pavement also appears to be in excellent condition. It was Sunday that day and many people were walking to or from church, a rare sight.
<p/>

<h2>Kostroma</h2>
<p>
Visiting Kostroma <a href="http://goo.gl/HptpRi">8 years later</a> was undoubtedly pleasant. It seems that this time I spent less time in the city, but I walked around a large area, although this time I did not go inside the monasteries.
<p/>

In search of monuments to Lenin, I visited the industrial areas of this ancient city, which are not so far from the historical center.

On the other side of the house, Lenin stands symmetrically in good condition. I wonder who stood on the first podium? Was it really Stalin before 1956?

The last time I was in Kostroma was on the holiday of November 4, and this time I was on the city day. The center was crowded. Around the monument to Ivan Susanin there is no crowd among the shops, which, it turns out, now advertise themselves in Chinese.

<h2>Ivanovo</h2>
<p>
I’ve been to Ivanovo several times, but each time I was passing through, I never really explored the city. Ivanovo is formally part of the Golden Ring, but usually everyone passes by, because there are no ancient monasteries here - the city is just over 100 years old. But in fact, there are interesting places here even without monasteries.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257262955_ef16f7284a_o.jpg">

<p>
The last time I walked around the city was <a href="http://goo.gl/uUETD4">in 2011</a>. A lot has changed in 8 years. For example, the river embankment has now been developed.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257262890_a01256e702_o.jpg">
<p>
On the other side is the factory building. In Ivanovo, a lot of industrial architecture from the early 20th century has been preserved in the city center.

<p>
The layout of the city is unusual: there is not one main square as such, but rather two separate pieces, between which there is a manufactory and a river and several more blocks. To the north of the river there will be Lenin Square.
<p/>

The city is very car-heavy; for example, in this square there is an unregulated crossing with 6 lanes! I drove around Ivanovo a little by car, it was quite stressful - everyone was driving fast and honking their horns often.

It's nice to see that some things don't change. This poster hung here on my last visit in 2011 (the right side is dedicated to the 140th anniversary of the city in 2011). At this rate, it can live up to the 150th anniversary in 2021.

Ivanovo railway station is one of the most unusual train stations that I have seen, not only in Russia, but throughout the world. I don’t know by what miracle this old building was preserved in the form of a huge wooden palace.

There are generally many extraordinary Soviet monuments in Ivanovo - not just the eternal flame or the monument to Lenin, but for example the monument to the first Soviet of Workers and Peasants in Russia, created here in 1905.
