<h1>Turkey: Konya, Cumra, Karaman</h1>
<i>25-27 July 2023</i>
<h2>Konya</h2>
<p>
Once in summer in Kemer it was +40, too hot even for me. I decided to travel around Turkey for a couple of days, drink tea, eat kebabs, and see museums. I was in the north in Isparta, in the northwest in Denizli too. I have been in the west in Fethiye, in the southwest in Kas, in the east in Adana, in the southeast in Alanya, in the south there is only the sea. All that remains is to go northeast, to Konya. I was there too, <a href="../ankara">but in winter</a>, and came from Ankara.

A large tunnel was recently built, thanks to which the journey from Antalya to Konya along the new road became an hour and a half shorter. Though, most of the buses travel along the old road.

The bus station, as usual, is on the outskirts; fortunately, one of two tram lines goes there.

The card cost only 5 liras, the fare was 8.50 (in Antalya shortly before this the price had risen to 15).

<h2>Çumra</h2>
<p>
Near Konya there is one of the few places on the World Heritage List that I have not previously visited - the excavations of Çatalhöyük. The nearest city to them is called Çumra, it is about 40 kilometers from Konya. Recently, the high-speed railway line was extended from Konya further to the regional center of Karaman, and an intermediate stop was made in Çumra. Therefore, now you can get there in just 20 minutes comfortably.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53076966075_2b2a9a09c4_o.jpg" >
<p>
From Çumra itself there are still 10 kilometers to the excavations. If minibuses even go there, they are very rare, so I spent money on a taxi. According to the meter, including the wait, it came out to about $15 (400 liras).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53077058988_0930a9b950_o.jpg" >
<p>
Çatalhöyük is a Neolithic city. It existed from approximately 7500 to 5500 BC (that is, not as ancient as Göbekli Tepe, but much older than the Egyptian pyramids). Now only one piece of the excavation is open to the public.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53075981312_ac1c9a4f4c_o.jpg" >
<p>
You can see the walls of the houses tightly adjacent to each other.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53076752974_33b0328b5f_o.jpg" >
<p>
It was in these holes in the floor that the residents of Çatalhöyük buried their dead. Then, periodically, the roof of the house was torn down, a new one was built higher, and this created layers of burials.
<p/>

<p>
It sounds strange at first glance, but for someone who has been to the <a href="../samoa">Pacific Islands</a> and seen graves there right at the entrance to every house, it is not so unusual.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53076752969_c1c0d01f33_o.jpg" >
<p>
In the distance you can see a “layered” wall - in fact, these are layers of garbage that have been thrown there for decades. The fact is that in this city there were no streets familiar to us; people walked mainly on the roofs of houses, and the spaces between houses were used for garbage. The houses were entered through a hatch in the roof.

I spent quite a lot of time in Çumra, since trains are not very frequent. Railway station:

The main thing is that in this city I was able to open an account at Vakif Bank for free and get a card (usually they ask for about $300 for this).

<h2>Karaman</h2>
<p>
Karaman is a regional center in Turkey, nothing particularly remarkable, but since I was in Çumra, and a high-speed railway was built there, I decided to get to it.

<p>
“Turkish society, which knows how to defend its country and independence, must also protect its language from the oppression of foreign languages,” Ataturk said and removed many borrowings from the language. For example, the word "independence" - Bağımsızlık, literally meaning "lack of ties", it was created instead of the Arabic loan istiklal.
