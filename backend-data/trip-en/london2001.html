<h1>UK: London, Windsor, Brighton</h1>
<i>28 July - 11 August 2001</i>
<h2>London</h2>
<p>
In the summer of 2001 I visited the UK for the first time. This trip was a reward for winning a school Olympiad (I don’t remember exactly which one now). We were a large group of about 30 such winners. We lived in a small village near the town of Dorking, south of London - there, at the boarding school in the summer, they organized something like an international camp for learning English. Besides us, there were many children and teenagers from different countries: a large group from <a href="../taiwan">Taiwan</a>, much like ours, and children from different European countries who came there individually. Every day there were English classes in the morning, and in the evening all sorts of games and cultural events. Box Hill School is located in a Victorian mansion.

This is the main building, also known as Dalewood House.

There were several trips from school: for half a day we went to the pool in the nearest city, and to the bowling club. There were also three full-fledged excursions: to the center of London, to Windsor Castle and to the city of Brighton. The trip to London was quite short. First we drove up to the Tower.

One of these photos is the very first photo I took, but I'm not exactly sure which one.

From there we sailed along the Thames by boat. The view from the Tower has changed a lot since then - now there are no high-rise buildings on the left, but there is a skyscraper called The Shard.

You can see old license plates - these are still around today, but much less common and more likely in the outback or on small islands, most of the plates are according to European Union standards.

The city of Brighton is located on the south coast of England. There is a royal palace there in Indian style.

Judging by Google street view, this building has not changed in 20 years, even the sign is the same.

An interesting detail is that the LGBT flag hangs on the building on the left.
