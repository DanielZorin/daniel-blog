<h1>China: Heihe, Harbin, Changchun, Jilin, Shenyang, Dandong, Dalian</h1>
<i>1-13 March 2015</i>
<h2>Heihe</h2>
<p>
First steps on Chinese soil.
<p/>

<p>
By Chinese standards, Heihe is a complete wilderness, and also very cold. The population is a measly 200 thousand. I was sure that everything here would be tailored exclusively for Russian shopping tourists, but this turned out to be far from the case. In Heihe, no one speaks Russian, except for a few salespeople in the central supermarket who know a few words and numbers. Complete adaptation - you check into a hotel, explaining yourself with gestures, in a restaurant you choose dishes at random from pictures or a list of Chinese names. Perspicacious Chinese: why tie the entire life of a city to trade with Russia if the economy there could collapse at any moment and work would be lost? At most, you can take the trouble to translate the sign with Baidu translate and rewrite it with errors.
<p/>

<p>
More advanced ones come up with separate names that are understandable to Russians.

<p>
My favorite is the Putin restaurant.

<p>
Went in for lunch. By local standards, this is not the cheapest restaurant; even the menu is decently translated into Russian.
<p/>

<p>
A typical Chinese dish, costs about 20 yuan. In China, meat is always cut into narrow and long pieces so that it is convenient to eat with chopsticks.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256374213_65a63cb433_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is a simpler restaurant. The clear, sticky noodles are found throughout China, but are more popular in the north.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256174416_60a300231e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A Chongqing-style samovar is a hot pot, a popular dish in the south.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256373828_1182c14289_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Delicious sweet potatoes. Except for Heihe, I haven’t seen this dish anywhere else since later.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256373803_5d28a40735_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Heihe is full of cheap hotels; unlike other cities, it is not a problem for a foreigner to stay here.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255444827_9420efea16_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The best store in Heihe.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256374033_2ca01e609c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The infrastructure in Heihe is a million times better than in any similar Russian town. The roads are ideal with 10 lanes, the cold climate is not a problem.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256174271_7e05996d9d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Typical Chinese architecture is quite attractive.
<p/>

<p>
Bus stop.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255444737_ca61b5e4dc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Buses in Heihe are little. These buses usually travel between Chinese cities and villages. According to Chinese tradition, bus routes written in Chinese are posted at bus stops. Buses run frequently, so the exact minute-by-minute schedule is not indicated.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257217460_300c8542ba_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The station is quite impressive in size for a city with two trains a day.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256373703_48c6e267bb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A statue with a drugged horse, they like to put it in different Chinese cities, as if it is not just a city, but a tourist center of some class.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256373593_65c31e06e2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Street names are duplicated in Russian.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256373628_b6fc1ca9e9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The statues in the courtyards are funny.
<p/>

<p>
Snowmen.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256174636_3a65885e9c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The main street is simply gorgeous for such a wilderness.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256374003_0be31e5c41_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The bushes are trimmed in the shape of nesting dolls.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256373893_1afb6f9007_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Everything costs two yuan ($0.3).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255445207_a3b8fd1b6a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In northern Chinese cities, entrances to premises are covered with massive curtains like this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256922524_d994c9fabc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The main shopping center of Huafu looks very kitschy.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256373853_5a2fc0d0b8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There's nothing to do inside. The selection is dull, the prices are very high. There are almost no buyers.
<p/>

<p>
A farewell look at Russia.

<p>
We go further to Harbin.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257217795_e93707b65a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Have you ever seen the streets of a Russian town illuminated like this at night?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256174861_8ca6c57bf9_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Harbin</h2>
<p>
Harbin is one of many Chinese cities founded by Europeans who grabbed parts of the weakening country in the 19th century. Following the successful annexation of the modern Far East after the second Opium War (1862), plans were prepared in Russia to squeeze out even more territories in northern China. A fleet base was built in Port Arthur and a railway was constructed to Vladivostok directly through the territory of China (it was easier to build through China than through the wild territories north of the Amur). Harbin appeared as a station where a branch began from the railway from Chita to Vladivostok to the south to Port Arthur. The railway has long been transferred to China, and Harbin is now a city with a population 10 times larger than Vladivostok.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256915459_8b58f3a14b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
After the 1917 revolution, many Russian emigrants lived in Harbin, but after the advent of communism in China, the community came to an end. All that remains is the Church of St. Sophia, which houses an architecture museum.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256366193_c98cf6cd8c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Russian architecture? More like a stylization of it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256915109_3f72bd2397_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It has its own Kremlin tower.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256914819_48e22eb2d3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
More in common with the architecture of a later period. It is ironic that this building was built, it seems, in the year of the collapse of the Soviet Union.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256366178_473c2766fa_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Bas-relief with athletes, then the Kremlin towers, and then a skyscraper.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257209730_b7642c63e6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Yes, in Harbin, as in any self-respecting Chinese city, residential buildings compete in height.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257209805_46d692e58f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There in the distance there is something similar to St. Isaac's Cathedral.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256914904_211f723bba_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the distance on the left, it also seems to be skewed toward Russia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255437272_d562cca142_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But the most accurate one is probably this one. Similar to a House of Culture.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256914964_47dabe642b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There's some good stucco here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256167346_3de4569881_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At what point did they decide to build in the Stalinist Empire style in China?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257210305_d75abecd72_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At the same time, when did they begin to place sculptures in the style of socialist realism in parks?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256915624_81081f1fe9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In any case, capitalism is now being built here, much like in <a href="../guangdong">Guangzhou</a>.

<p>
The names of a couple of streets still remind us of Russia. Gogol Street (Guogeli).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256914884_45aebadf71_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Stalin Street (Sidalin).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256166921_d4aba21d5e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And this is what stands on Gogol Street.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256914869_4e345c8fae_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And this is what Stalin Street looks like.
<p/>

The Chinese are the grandmasters of night illumination.

<p>
What else is typically Chinese here is the filthy courtyards with heaps of all sorts of rubbish right in the center.
<p/>

<p>
And, of course, palaces.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256915599_cc1357fba2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
What is China without palaces?
<p/>

<p>
The best one seems to be on the other side of the river.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256915559_ea582fd2fd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The river freezes in winter, the ice is quite dirty.

<p>
Harbin jalopy. Unlike its southern counterparts, it is completely covered to protect from the cold.
<p/>

<p>
Like any serious city of 10 million, Harbin has a metro, one line for now. All subways in China look the same.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256366603_e44eaa2d4d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Even at -20, the Chinese go out into the streets to dance to slow pop music.
<p/>

<p>
At the end of February, China celebrates the New Year (according to the Chinese calendar). It is better not to travel to China at this time, because all transport and attractions will be crowded. I wisely skipped the event, but it looks like the after-party will be going on for a while. At least in Harbin there were always New Year's fireworks in the evenings. Chinese fireworks are very specific. They are more like a mixture of firecrackers with sparklers, because they do not fly up, but explode on the ground. When they are released en masse in yards, it seems as if there is a shootout going on all around.
<p/>

<h2>Changchun</h2>
<p>
On September 18, 1931, the Japanese blew up a railway on the outskirts of Shenyang (the road passed to the Japanese after the Russian-Japanese War of 1904-1905), blamed the Chinese for this, after which "polite" Japanese soldiers appeared in the territory of northeast China, supporting the desire of the local Manchus to federalize from China (<i>It's a reference to the similar invasion of Russia into Ukraine that happened back then in 2014</i>). The capital of the <s>Manchu People's Republic</s> Manchukuo became the city of Changchun, and the ruler was the former last Chinese emperor Pu Yi. Now, by the way, the Manchus, who conquered China in the mid-17th century and founded the Qing Empire, have almost completely assimilated, Manchu language practically disappeared from use.

<p>
How do Chinese museums differ from Russian ones? In Russia, in such places they usually lay out all sorts of objects that have survived from those times, but the Chinese instead make entire sculptural compositions illustrating the events described on posters and photographs.
<p/>

<p>
In format, this is most similar to a panorama of the Battle of Borodino.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257047730_06a442ea91_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Since this museum is dedicated to tragic events, it also contains many epic compositions symbolizing suffering under the yoke of the occupiers...

In Changchun, some buildings from the occupation times have been preserved: the imperial palace.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256004291_a7585583cc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And the main square with government buildings.

<p>

<p/>

<p>
Now there are still pretentious sculptures on it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255274527_6b0768d314_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Otherwise, Changchun is huge and spacious, like other Chinese regional centers.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255274357_4e071215fd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The main street. There are no traffic jams in Changchun.

<p/>

Occasionally there are pompous buildings.

<p>
Sino-Roman style.

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255274292_d847fb6c6a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But this is the view that opens up if you turn from the main street to the side right next to the station. On the left side there are entirely cheap hotels.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256003741_7bfb993c02_h.jpg"/>

At night all the signs are lit.

<p>
In these areas, parking is haphazard, so they carry a lot of dirt. There is still room for improvement for local landscapers.
<p/>

<p>
In Changchun, I first tried a wonderful restaurant format: you put ingredients in a bowl, and they cook soup from them. The price usually directly depends on the weight.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257047830_1456efdf3d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is almost no graffiti in China; usually only schools and kindergartens are painted.

For some reason, Chinese antennas always resemble the Eiffel Tower.

<p>
And in northern China they paint trees with white paint, like in Russia and <a href="../albania">Albania</a>!

<h2>Jilin</h2>
<p>
There is one reason to come to Jilin - here you can observe one unusual natural phenomenon.

The Songhua River does not freeze in winter. On a cold winter morning, steam rises from it, covering the trees on the shore with frost.

Either I arrived too late (although it seems that despite the beginning of March it was very cold, around -20), or it wasn’t humid enough, but it didn’t look nearly as cool as in the photographs.

Train Station. Getting around it is an adventure. You cannot go through the station (unless you have a ticket). You need to either make a detour two blocks away, or go through an unfinished tunnel for cars.

When you travel around China, you can sometimes see entire new cities being built. At the initial stage they look like ghost towns, but gradually they become populated.

<h2>Shenyang</h2>
<p>
Shenyang (Mukden) was once the capital of Manchuria before it conquered China. Therefore, it has its own “Forbidden City”, a prototype of the one in Beijing, where the first emperors of the Qing dynasty lived.
<p/>

The Shenyang Palace is smaller than the Beijing Palace, but visually very similar. There are many pavilions for all possible entertainment.

There are a huge number of clothing brands in China that you have never heard of. When you walk through a local shopping center, familiar names like Zara and H&M are not visible, unless it is a relatively high-end shopping center with Western clothes. The mass market belongs to Chinese companies.

<h2>Dandong</h2>
<p>
The city of Dandong, small by Chinese standards, is notable primarily for the fact that it is located on the border with one of the most incomprehensible countries in the world - North Korea. China and the DPRK are connected by a railway-road bridge and complex relations. On the one hand, North Korea still exists mainly thanks to China, who saved the North Koreans during the 1953-1956 war, helped them avoid starvation in the 1990s, and generally largely saves the DPRK from complete collapse, all for the sake of geopolitics. On the other hand, crazy neighbors who spend all the country’s resources on creating nuclear bombs are not very pleasant for the Chinese either, and the North Koreans do not consider China, which has slipped into capitalism, as friends in official propaganda.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256047971_386820d1b3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also an old bridge next to the existing bridge. Half of it was destroyed by bombing during the Korean War, and it was left as a monument.
<p/>

<p>
Border terminal building. Tourists not from Russia who travel to North Korea travel in transit through China, because it is much more convenient than through Vladivostok. You can fly from Beijing to Pyongyang or take a train via Dandong.
<p/>

<p>
You cannot leave North Korea freely, but it seems the system now is roughly the same as it was in the USSR, that is, if you are close to the party and Kim Jong-un, then you can. There are a lot of Korean signs and restaurants in Dandong, and I doubt that defectors hang out there, nostalgic for their homeland. The homeland is clearly visible from here. In summer, there are even pleasure boats for tourists, from which you can take a closer look at that shore.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256796074_f25fca3ecc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In appearance, North Korea is similar to some small town in the CIS.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255318382_dfd3233567_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Let’s not forget that this is one of the most prosperous cities in the country, which they try to keep in order.
<p/>

I wonder what it’s like for them to live on the other side and see what’s going on on this side? I doubt that anyone in the cities really believes the propaganda and has no idea how people live outside of North Korea.

From Dandong you can drive a little along the border, the road goes along the river bank. On the other side are ordinary villages.

The second time I was so close to the border, but did not cross to the other side because it was problematic. The first time was at <a href="../tel-aviv">the border between Israel and Lebanon</a>.

Besides the border with North Korea, there is plenty to do in Dandong. For example, here you can visit the Great Wall of China, its most eastern section.

<p/>

<p>
Once upon a time, I read in children's books that the Great Wall was built by order of the first emperor Qin Shihuang (the same one who made the Terracotta Army). In reality, what was built then can only be seen in excavations. The current wall, where it survives, mainly dates from the Ming Dynasty (14th to 17th centuries). And those areas where tourists go (mainly near Beijing) were generally rebuilt in the 20th century. The site in Dandong is no better or worse than the ones in Beijing in this regard.

<p>
Due to the proximity of the border, there are many Korean restaurants here. According to the Korean tradition, you order one dish (in this case, meat in batter at the bottom), and for an appetizer they bring you a bunch of spicy cabbage, cucumbers, and in this relatively reputable establishment they even brought a whole plate with rice, vegetables and fried eggs (much later I found out , that this is nothing more than the popular Korean dish "bibimbap").
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257092615_32656cc012_h.jpg"/>

There is even a Russian restaurant! There is black bread, herring, and Baltika beer. The prices are quite high.

When I was in China for the first time in 2008, business cards of prostitutes were actively distributed near hotels, which marked the beginning of my collection. Now in the northern part of the country they have been replaced by a new trick: sticking advertisements directly on the sidewalk. I was trying to understand the inscription, it seems to be some kind of play on words, because it literally means “packed girls.”

<h2>Dalian</h2>
<p>
I really wanted to escape the winter frosts, and finally, the temperature in Dalian became positive! The city immediately began to sparkle with new colors.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256793689_ce16ad0c56_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Finding a hotel took a very long time. There were problems in Dandong too, but I attributed them to the proximity of the border. However, in Dalian I was not accommodated in any cheap hotel near the station, which is actually par for the course for big cities in China. However, on the other side of the station there was a very pretentious-looking hotel, where a room cost only 78 yuan ($12). In terms of price-quality ratio, this is one of the best results in China, and simply outstanding for such a metropolis (usually the best hotels at low prices are in small towns near national parks).
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256793754_66ad0c4576_h.jpg"/>
<p>
All Chinese hotels have rubber slippers, which are very convenient. In Russia and Europe I always carried my own slippers, but in China I never needed them. Almost every room has a kettle, and often a desktop computer too.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256045596_63eebcfa61_h.jpg"/>

Another undoubted advantage of this hotel is the enchanting view from the window.

<p>
In most Chinese megacities, the development is quite chaotic, there is no such thing as a high-rise block proudly rising somewhere in the middle. What is called a skyline in America exists in every big city. There is one in Dalian too. Another exception is Chongqing and Shanghai.
<p/>

Dalian (Dalny) was founded in 1898 by the Russians, who leased the surrounding area for a naval base known as Port Arthur. After the Russo-Japanese War, it passed to the Japanese, who, however, continued to build it according to the Russian plan. Some buildings from those times have been preserved in Dalian.
