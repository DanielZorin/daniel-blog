<h1>Turkey: Istanbul</h1>
<i>8-15 March 2022</i>
<h2>Istanbul</h2>
<p>
I flew to Istanbul and rented a small apartment under a roof in a poor area near Taksim Square. There was a good view of the city from the window, the radiator provided excellent warmth during this cold season.

The area is undoubtedly colorful, although life here is undoubtedly not for everybody.

The closest mosque and supermarket to me was BIM, where you can buy a SIM card for 150 liras (half the price of any other place).

A couple of days later, bad weather arrived - Istanbul was covered in snow, even many flights at the airport were cancelled.

We had to be careful walking along the steep streets.

I didn’t intend to live in Istanbul for a long time (I already wrote that I don’t really like this city for living), I just wanted to take a break for a week. There wasn't much to do, I visited several banks with varying success and once crawled to the historical center.

Prices have increased significantly since December, in one restaurant where I was near the station, the price increased three times (it was the only cheap restaurant in the area, now the prices there are the same as in other tourist ones). But in Ortaklar near the Theodosius cistern the prices are still low. Kebab is only 35 lira.
