<h1>French Polynesia</h1>
<i>1-4 February 2020</i>
<h2>Tahiti</h2>
<p>
The last country in Oceania is French Polynesia. Further east there is only the lonely Pitcairn Island, which is several days away by boat, the Chilean Easter Island and the shores of South America. From Tahiti to Paris the distance is 15,700 kilometers, which is 1,000 kilometers less than from Paris to New Caledonia, and the shortest route is through America, not through Asia. Flights from France land in Los Angeles, and tickets from the US West Coast are inexpensive.

We are approaching Tahiti. The beginning of February is the rainy season, the number of tourists is low.

You can enter Tahiti if you have a Schengen visa issued by France (as well as other French colonies around the world). The French have their own idea of ​​what kind of jobs there are, their questionnaires always confuse me about which item to choose. In most countries, you need to enter a profession in words, rather than choosing from a list.

The capital of French Polynesia is called Papeete. It is the third largest city on the islands of Oceania after <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/579305.html">Noumea</a> and <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/ 542640.html">Suva</a>. Here in the center is densely built, with many shops and shopping centers, however, on Sunday they were all closed, and the streets were empty, as if the coronavirus had already arrived in the city.

The heart of the city is the market. By the way, it is the only place that works on Sunday, although only early in the morning.

I thought it was a fruit like jackfruit (to which it is related), but it turned out that it is not eaten raw. You need to remove the outer peel, cut into pieces and cook in a pan. It tastes like potatoes. The cheapest way to get carbs in Tahiti.

Supermarket. As in New Caledonia, there is a huge selection of wine, cheese and other French goods. The prices seemed to me not as steep as in Noumea; I bought some beef and pork for 15 dollars per kilo.

The girl on the left is covered in traditional Polynesian tattoos. Although the phenomenon of body painting existed even in ancient Rome, it was only in Polynesia that tattooing in prominent places was widespread in society since ancient times. The word itself also came to us from Polynesia.

One day I went for a ride around the island of Tahiti. Tahiti consists of two touching circular isles, in the center of each one there is a volcano: large Tahiti Iti and small Tahiti Nui. All life is centered on Tahiti Iti, the city of Papeete is on the western shore, and on the opposite side there is an isthmus connecting Tahiti Nui and the city of Taravao. In Tahiti Iti there is one large road around the entire (half)island, in Taravao two roads diverge from it along the edge of Tahiti Nui, and both quickly end, the far part of Tahiti Nui is impassable.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256635995_082f6c67bc_o.jpg">
<p>
Public transport in Tahiti runs more or less regularly, but only on weekdays, and at 4 o'clock it stops running. Buses run across the entire island to Taravao approximately once an hour.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254859437_e774010974_o.jpg">
<p>
The buses are surprisingly good, some even have USB chargers.

The middle of the island is occupied by high, impassable mountains. All life is mainly along the coast.

Tahiti is a volcanic island, so there are no good white sand beaches here, everything is in Bora Bora. The coast is mostly rocky.

<h2>Moorea</h2>
<p>
Near Tahiti, the large island of Moorea is the only island that is reasonably accessible by ferry rather than by plane (although there are 10-minute flights from Tahiti too). Unlike buses, ferries at least run on Sunday.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256652653_fa49eaae36_o.jpg">
<p>
Although the trip is only about 20 minutes, the waters between the two islands are rough, and there is terrible rocking. I crawled out of the ship very pale, even though it was a huge ferry. I’m afraid to imagine what it would be like on a small boat.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256452326_d9280e06aa_o.jpg">
<p>
Public transport, extremely rare to begin with, did not work on Sunday, so I went for a walk. Moorea is a fairly large island, and, like Tahiti, the roads all go around the perimeter, and in the center there are mountains. There are much fewer people here, there are no cities, only small villages with small streets perpendicular to the highway.
