<h1>Portugal: Lisbon, Santarem, Porto</h1>
<i>10-12 August 2024</i>
<h2>Lisbon</h2>
<p>
After a month in Africa, I flew to Lisbon - the most convenient destination from Cape Verde. Portugal was the first country I went to on my own in 2011. Since then, I have been there twice more - in 2014 and 2016. And now, I can't believe it, eight years later, I am walking along these streets again.

<p>
I specifically chose a hotel in this area so as not to walk far. However, it is also relatively inexpensive here - about 40 euros for a room, budget-friendly by today's standards, especially in August.
<p/>

<p>
The hotel was upstairs, not far from the Santa Justa elevator.

<p>
I was very tired, I hadn't slept well the night before, and I wasn't planning on going anywhere far. The feeling of lightness from being in Portugal was enough.

You can eat Brazilian acai in Portugal. It's awesome - costs about 8 euros.
<p/>

<p>
What I wanted to do was ride this tram once, I've never done it before. Especially since I had a day pass. But it turned out to be not so easy, there are a lot of people who want to ride the tram, and it's not easy to squeeze into it. And most of them, it seems, are tourists.
<p/>

<p>
In the end, I waited closer to the end of the route, and even then I had to stand.

This is already a cheap area, there are 1 euro shops.

<p>
Prices for fish dishes, not expensive. In general, Portugal is a relatively cheap country even now, although not as cheap as in 2011. Over these 13 years, many have appreciated Portugal, it has become a super-touristy place and a mecca for nomads, and the cost of rent in Lisbon has gone through the roof. It has become unrealistic to get a residence permit, applications are processed for years.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945083407_da1e85825a_h.jpg" >

There is a lot of fish and seafood in the stores.

<h2>Santarem</h2>
<p>
Although I didn't have much time in Portugal, I still wanted to see some new city. It had to be between Lisbon and Porto, which meant either Fatima (if going by bus) or Santarem (if going by train). I chose the train, because I missed trains. I had already been to the city of Santarem in <a href="../amazonia">Brazil</a>.
<p/>

<p>
Portuguese train. The bus is generally cheaper if you buy a ticket well in advance.

<p>
The train station is far from the city, and in a lowland, while the city itself is on a hill. I wanted to get to the center by bus, but they don't run on weekends.
<p/>

If you walk to the end of the main street, there will be the edge of the hill, on which there is a fortress. Only small walls remain of it, and now there is a garden.

Most of all in Portugal I wanted to wander around my favorite city of Porto.

It's funny, but I don't think I've ever gone far into Gaia before, except for this observation deck and the embankment below (where the port wine warehouses are). It's not as beautiful there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945128677_fe4a66d6fa_h.jpg" >

I decided to walk to another bridge, there are some fields there, and election posters.
