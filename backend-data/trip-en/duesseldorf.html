<h1>Germany: Düsseldorf, Cologne, Bonn, Trier</h1>
<i>24-27 June 2012</i>
<h2>Düsseldorf</h2>
<p>
Düsseldorf is a gray and gloomy city.
<p/>

<p>
Even the obelisks here seem to have been taken... well, you understand where.
<p/>

<p>
The European Football Championship was going on, so there was an outpouring of patriotism unprecedented for Germany: flags were hanging in the windows.
<p/>

<p>
In normal times this would be considered a sign of extreme nationalism.
<p/>

<p>
Tram tracks dispel the melancholy.

<p>
Stops are indicated by cubes with the letter H (Halte).
<p/>

<p>
Street signs with house numbers for the nearest block, like in Stockholm.

An interesting German thing is a public bookcase. You can take a book to read or put down your own.

<h2>Cologne</h2>
<p>
One of the most uninteresting cities I've ever been to. There is absolutely nothing to see here except the cathedral. You can simply arrive by train, go into the cathedral, which is directly opposite the station, and leave. In a city where there are two red men at the traffic lights, things cannot be good, as we have already seen in the example of <a href="http://juan-sin-tierra.livejournal.com/244805.html">Oslo</a> .
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256029131_4bd98e9387_o.jpg">
<p>
The city looks like this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256777279_cecbe0da69_o.jpg">
<p>
Traffic lights say "Please wait" when they are red.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256777279_cecbe0da69_o.jpg">
<p>
Only occasionally does something stand out.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257072985_89f9a9b973_o.jpg">
<p>
Like this balcony.
<p/>

<p>
Over the river.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256029156_a2dce96968_o.jpg">
<p>
On the embankment there is a microscopic restored area of three houses.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256029181_6e488bc466_o.jpg">
<p>
And one more.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257073050_0bc2de972b_o.jpg">
<p>
And then it’s rough again.
<p/>

<h2>Bonn</h2>
<p>
This is where the emergency communication poles in the Moscow metro come from.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255993882_ba8a448506_o.jpg">
<p>
Bonn stands in stark contrast to Cologne. The streets are much more lively.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256690844_a5f519cdd6_o.jpg">
<p>
Overall beautiful houses instead of gray boxes.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256143258_017064af0e_o.jpg">
<p>
Bells are hung on the facade. For some reason, in every city in Germany there is one house decorated like this.
<p/>

<p>
Beethoven was born in Bonn. This was also the capital of Germany before the fall of the Berlin Wall.

Let's go across the river.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256143348_e5130479c6_o.jpg">
<p>
It turns out it’s also nice across the river.
<p/>

<p>
People read a newspaper on a stand, like in Oslo or St. Petersburg.

<h2>Trier</h2>
<p>
Of course, everyone wants to know what the farthest outskirts of a run-of-the-mill German city look like. It looks something like this. Overall very good, the main problem is that there is nowhere to go in the evening because nothing works. However, this is also typical for large cities.

Trier, like Bonn, is pleasant to look at.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255860723_4565fda081_o.jpg">

There are several typical German houses.

Trier was on the northeastern outskirts of the Roman Empire; many buildings remained from the Romans, which is unusual for Germany.

<p>
Among the famous people, Karl Marx was born in Trier. It's lucky that it's not in the GDR, otherwise the house would have been covered in rotten tomatoes.
