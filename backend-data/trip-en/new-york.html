<h1>USA: New York, Jersey City</h1>

<h2>New York</h2>
<p>
New York is not beautiful at all. Only the panorama of lower Manhattan is pleasant, but otherwise it is a pile of buildings one on top of another without a single style, many ugly facades, narrow houses squeezed into empty corners; only here and there are pompous skyscrapers. And all this makes this city so interesting to explore.
<p/>

<p>
The best way to explore New York is by subway. A taxi costs 10-20 times more, and only the rich ride it. Or if you quickly need to get directly from the Bronx to Queens (the subway goes through Manhattan), but you are unlikely to have such a need. A weekly pass costs about $30, a single trip ticket costs $2.50.
<p/>

<p>
The metro has a huge number of stops; traveling 15-20 stops is normal here. There are several lines that are indicated on the diagrams by different letters, but with the same color. Trains on these lines follow the same route, but some stop at all stations, others only at a few large ones in the center, and at all on the outskirts.
<p/>

<p>
The metro looks pretty cool. There are rumors that rats live in the subway. I confirm, I also saw one on the platform, but it ran away when I wanted to photograph it.
<p/>

<p>
The exits from the metro are such that you can’t slip back.
<p/>

<p>
In the center (in Manhattan) everyone takes the subway, but closer to the outskirts, where more immigrants live, you can feel like you are in a ghetto. Especially good introduction is when coming from the airport, the line goes through the entire borough of Queens. Teenagers walk around the carriages and perform gangsta rap. Social advertising is also for them.
<p/>

<p>
There are also buses on which you can travel across Manhattan (the subway lines run lengthwise) using the same tickets as the subway. In other areas (Bronx, Queens, etc.), where traffic is not the same as in Manhattan, it is mainly the poorest sections of society who ride the buses. You can also get to the airport by bus, spending only 2.50 along with the metro ride. You can get from the airport this way if you have a metro ticket at hand, or if you are really determined, take the Aeroexpress to the Jamaica metro station (payment for the Aeroexpress is at the exit), buy a ticket from the machine for $2.50, return by Aeroexpress to the airport and go by bus.
Schoolchildren are traditionally transported by school buses.

<p>
Most streets in the center are one-way. There are "One Way" signs everywhere. Here is a typical New York street sign post. Please note that you cannot drive along this street alone, only with passengers.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257603005_5dc26323b0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Posted everywhere on the subway stairs are messages to call the police if anything looks suspicious. There are posters in the carriages urging you to be vigilant and report things left in the carriage.

<p>
Threat signs are a hallmark of the United States. If something is prohibited, then it will not just say, say, “Do not enter,” but “Everyone who enters will be punished.”

You are under video surveillance. Be civilized, don't piss on the street.

<p>
Do not gather more than 216! (It's in the Metropolitan Museum of Art). No one is counting, but if anything happens, the sign hangs in the corner, whoever didn’t hide, it’s not our fault. Also, at the entrance to any park, opening hours are indicated; if some homeless person decides to spend the night there, there will be a legal reason to send him away.
<p/>

There are quite a lot of homeless people in New York. There is not enough space, not enough for everyone. New York also lacks places for tourists, that is, hotels. Those that exist are simply unreal. There is one establishment called Sun Bright Hotel. Rooms there cost about $50 a day. This is what it looks like.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257545539_43bd91727a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is the worst hotel of all the dozens I've been to, especially considering the exorbitant price. The writing on the shower door is heartfelt.
<p/>

<p>
Mostly Chinese (it's in the middle of Chinatown) and Indians live here. There is no alternative - in the vast New York there are a measly dozen of hostels, places in them must be booked in advance, and the beds are simply prohibitively expensive: almost the same 50 dollars. So the question is which is worse. In principle, you can live in the Sun Bright Hotel, not for weeks, of course. Yes, the floor in the shower is a little wet, although after -8 hours from Moscow I was the first to get into the shower at 6 am, when it was still in perfect order. Yes, instead of a ceiling there is a mesh, because of this it is not completely dark at night, but people are not noisy, so you can sleep. The Internet, unfortunately, slows down in the evenings when everyone is loading it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256761598_36cabe9128_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Food in New York is so-so, restaurants are expensive, McDonald's and various ethnic establishments rule. I lived in Chinatown, so I ate at Chinese places. There is, for example, a mobile cart that sells crispy pieces of chicken for one and a half dollars, and Chinese noodles or rice for the same amount, cheap and cheerful. In snack bars it’s also normal.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256760783_b6a601e619_h.jpg"/>
<p>
McDonald's has two advantages. Firstly, this is not cliched fast food here, but national cuisine, you can go in with pride. Secondly, it works around the clock, so if you fly from Moscow, get up at five in the morning and are dying of hunger, then you can only eat there. Interestingly, the prices vary from state to state, and not just because of sales tax, base prices also vary.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256561846_540ec88a8f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Unfortunately, the morning menu is also available here. I had to drink coffee. The lid of the coffee says "Caution, Hot" not only in English, but also in Spanish.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257306999_a25b0a6138_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Ilf and Petrov wrote in "One-Storey America" that in America you can eat in pharmacies, where they serve monotonous lunches under numbers. Now “Lunch number 5” can be ordered at McDonald's, and pharmacies have been converted into supermarkets. The most popular chain in New York is Duane Reade, with pharmacies on every corner.
<p/>

<p>
New Yorkers drink coffee in droves in the morning. If you walk through Midtown at 9 o'clock, you can smell the subtle aroma of Starbucks everywhere.
<p/>

Fire hydrants in New York have unusual shapes.

And this is how they inform you about the goals of the construction.

<p>
In imperial propaganda you can often hear about the horrors of New York, that it is dirty, poor people and rats in the subway. The city didn’t seem that dirty to me, no worse than Moscow and much better than Brussels. In the mornings you can see Brussels scenes, but the packages are quickly taken away.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257307169_0509248de8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The sidewalk, you can appreciate the level of cleanliness.
<p/>

<p>
The name of the street is written on the descent to the crossing with tactile tiles.
<p/>

<p>
There is indeed steam from underground, but it is rare, and the smell is not particularly strong. <a href="../indonesia-1">Jakarta slums</a> are cooler.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256560156_d8afdd36a2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
What imperial propaganda could cling to is these posters. Why doesn’t Channel One talk every day about how millions of New Yorkers are dying of hunger?
<p/>

<p>
Hungry New York collects old clothes and sends them to second-hand stores in the great and beautiful Russia. By the way, it is again written on the box that whoever throws garbage there will be punished.

Now in New York there is an almost communist policy to equalize incomes of the population, the new mayor promises to continue taking money from the rich so that the poor can make ends meet. Ayn Rand turned over in her grave several times, but the monument to Lenin in New York is more relevant than ever.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256560521_1e449459e3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Ayn Rand was clearly inspired by the view of New York's Grand Central Station when writing "Atlas Shrugged".
<p/>

<p>
There is no bust of Nat Taggart here, and transcontinental trains have not been running from here for a long time. Passenger rail service in the USA is active mainly on the Atlantic coast, since the only high-speed train in the USA Boston - New York - Philadelphia - Washington runs there.
<p/>

<p>
Long-distance trains (and there are slow and very expensive trains across the country) leave from Penn Station. There is not a single bench in the entire station, with the exception of one hall, where people are allowed only with tickets.

Having visited New York, you can then identify familiar places in American movies. This is where, for example, Fry took his girlfriend on their first date (this is the Rockefeller Center).
<p/>

<p/>

<p>
There are not many people here in the morning; office workers are rushing about business.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257545619_824415923b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the evening the picture is more impressive.

Perhaps the most unusual skyscraper in New York (near the Brooklyn Bridge).

People are now allowed into Ground Zero on a first-come, first-served basis, although I wouldn’t say that there’s not a lot of room to squeeze into the place.

In general, the level of pathos in New York is not off the charts. There are not flags on every window. New York is not America.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257604295_e16f7246ce_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The best views, in my opinion, are in the central park.
<p/>

You should definitely go to the observation deck on the roof of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. By the way, it is free, unlike the Empire State Building and the Rockefeller Center.

Chinatown is one of the dirtiest places in New York. And most of the people are Chinese, it feels like you are in a big Asian city where Europeans are visiting tourists.
<p/>

Everything is calm in the Bronx. It’s a little freer here than in Manhattan; the houses are not located close to each other. Traditional stairs are present.

In general, Harlem is one of the cleanest and most pleasant areas of New York.

In any self-respecting black neighborhood, the main street, although it has a number, is named after Martin Luther King.

The free ferry takes you to the most un-New York of New York boroughs - Staten Island. Tourists often use this ferry to see the Statue of Liberty without landing on the island itself. Although it was a weekday morning, ferries ran more often than usual, they were not full, on the contrary, most of the places were empty. Staten Island can now be reached by car thanks to the tunnel.
<p/>

The ferry approaches the pier.
<p/>

<p>
The ferry passes Ellis Island. When there were no planes, everyone arrived in America by ship. At the entrance to the harbor there was a customs building (as in <a href="../rio-de-janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>), through which the ancestors of a significant part of the Americans passed. Usually you can go on an excursion to Ellis Island along with the Statue of Liberty (it is on the neighboring island), but recently the island has been closed for restoration.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257602445_7f43fd7aaa_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Staten Island is practically one-story America.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257307539_981ef339c5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Well, to be completely even, America is still not one-story, but two-story.

Oddly enough, there are areas on the island that are considered troubled. One of them, as I understand it, is in the area of this plant. It looks dull.

The view is not bad, although from Jersey I think it’s cooler. From there you can still see Midtown, but from here it is far away and not visible beyond the Brooklyn Bridge.

A unique place - rental of cassettes and discs is still preserved.

The most famous piece of Brooklyn in Russia is, of course, Brighton Beach, the Russian ghetto in New York.

Housing here is relatively inexpensive, since the area is located far from the center. From the metro station it seems that you are in your native Soviet Union, there are commieblocks all around.

But lower down there are actually small houses.

At Brighton the Soviet style is very well preserved. Look at this Oasis sign. This style is unique.

The embankment here is called the "boardwalk" in Russian too.

<p>
There are characters walking along the embankment that you haven’t seen in Russia for a long time. A sort of gangster from the nineties on an honorable pension.

Russians living in ghettos can be easily recognized in any country in the world by the stamp of centuries-old Soviet grief on their faces.

Another funny thing about Brighton is that when you pay with a card in stores here, they will charge you more money to compensate for the acquiring fee.

<h2>Jersey City</h2>

- Worse. In New Jersey.<br/>

New York is on the other side of the Hudson River. Day and monthly passes are not valid here, although tickets are visually the same as in New York. The poor have historically concentrated here, those who did not have money for housing even on the outskirts. But if you don’t know about it, you can’t tell by looking at it.

The roads in New Jersey are a hundred times clearer than in New York, but they also have a streetcar that runs through several adjacent cities. In fact, you can easily travel through the entire state by trains and trams.

Jersey City is so empty during the day that traffic controllers are calmly working at intersections.

Monuments in America are not like monuments in Russia and Europe. Here is the Korean War Veterans Memorial. Instead of stern pathetic faces - a soldier helping a wounded comrade.

Several monuments dedicated to September 11th. From here we had the best view of the WTC towers.
