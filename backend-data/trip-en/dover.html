<h2>Dover</h2>
<p>
Dover is the place where ferries go from England to France, and there are also white chalk cliffs desrrving the visit, even though they are lower than <a href="../ireland">Cliffs of Moher</a >.

<p>
The cliffs start almost immediately behind the city center and stretch for quite a long distance along the coast.

<p>
There are many ruins of old fortress walls on and around them.

<p>
The entrance to the ferry terminal is directly under the rock, to the left of it a small narrow staircase leads up.

Promenade along the tops of the rocks. A little higher there is a more equipped path, and at some point this one split in two, and the lower part was difficult to pass, I slipped on the clay and hurt myself a little on the thorns, so I had to go back a little.

Compared to the Cliffs of Moher, here the coastline is almost parallel to the sea, because of this the cliffs are only partially visible from above; they can only be fully seen from a ship.

<h2>Canterbury</h2>
<p>
On the way from Dover, I decided to stop in neighboring Canterbury, which is only 20-30 minutes away. The main cathedral of the Anglican Church is located here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255264907_83d8e0cea6_h.jpg"/>

<p>
The cathedral was under renovation, and the entrance fee was inhumane, so I didn’t go inside.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255264922_0956319ce0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It is interesting that the cathedral is surrounded on all sides by administrative buildings; the façade is not visible behind them.
<p/>

The outer walls of the city have been preserved in many places.

They are in such a dangerous condition that access to the inside has been closed.

Toilet under the elegant "privy" sign. Previously, I had only encountered this word in the speech of the characters in Game of Thrones.

In general, in England they know how to make some kind of inscription with elegant linguistic turns, no worse than in Japan.

Almost the entire historical center within the walls is pedestrian.

Theoretically, cars can pass if they really need to, but slowly and carefully.
