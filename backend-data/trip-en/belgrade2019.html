<h1>Serbia: Belgrade</h1>
<i>12 November 2019</i>
<h2>Belgrade</h2>
<p>
I bought tickets to Paris on Serbian Airlines with a transfer in Belgrade for almost a day, so there was time to walk around the Serbian capital. The last time I was in Serbia <a href="http://goo.gl/2gtkqD">in 2013</a>, and six months later in <a href="http://goo.gl/ V946P1">Kosovo</a>, which, according to part of the world, is also Serbia. Belgrade is still cheap and interesting.

It was my first time at Belgrade airport. It is quite close to the city center; the bus ride takes about 30 minutes. On the way, I saw an inscription on the wall that Kosovo is Serbia.

Some kind of slums.

The state building "Palace of Serbia" is across the river from the city center.

If you go down from here to the railway station, there will be a colorful bazaar on the descent; nothing has changed since 2013.

In Serbia, you can also sell hair (it is then used for hair extensions).

I walked to the Cathedral of St. Sava, which is at the far end of the historical center.

The cathedral itself is under reconstruction; only the basement is open.

Church of St. Mark. The architecture in Serbia is not similar to Russia, it is more reminiscent of Greece.

The interior decoration is austere.
