<h1>UAE: Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Ras al-Khaimah, Umm al-Quwain, Ajman, Dibba</h1>
<i>7-11 March 2023</i>
<h2>Abu Dhabi</h2>
<p>
Wizz Air started flying to Turkey, without thinking twice I bought tickets to Abu Dhabi for 60 euros round trip, since I had long been thinking about going to the UAE and Oman. Last time I was in <a href="../uae">Abu Dhabi</a> very briefly, this time it was better, although it still wasn’t much.
<p/>

<p>
We are approaching Abu Dhabi. It turned out that there is a railway in the UAE that is used for cargo transportation. Operating since 2016.

<p>
The cheapest accommodation on booking/airbnb in Abu Dhabi and Dubai (at least in the central part) are rooms in apartments converted into hotels. Costs about $30/day. The area is a little larger than in Hong Kong, but it is still more convenient in Hong Kong - the hotels there were originally designed as hotels, they have normal walls and a shower in each room. Here in an ordinary apartment, normal rooms are divided into two small ones by a wooden wall.
In the entrance hall there are portraits of sheikhs and teapots.

<p>
Since then, a separate entrance has been built there through a tunnel, and you need to get a QR code on the website to enter.

The part accessible to visitors seems to have been greatly reduced, with only two spots at the entrance doors.

A museum district is now being built on a once-empty island east of central Abu Dhabi. So far, only a branch of the Louvre is open, a branch of the Guggenheim and the main national museum are being built. Designed by top architectural bureaus.

<p>
The Louvre Museum is very interesting. As in many large art museums, the exhibition is arranged in chronological order, but usually the emphasis is always on the country where the museum is located (since there are many more exhibits from there), but here it turns out to be absolutely neutral. The exhibition goes from antiquity to the present, including paintings, statues, and examples of decorative and applied art. Starting with statues from 6500 BC.
<p/>

<p>
Here parallels are often drawn between different countries at approximately the same time - something that is rarely done in school and university, since the courses are usually Eurocentric. For example, samples of statues of different religions.

<h2>Dubai</h2>
<p>
I have a tradition - to come to Dubai once every five years: <a href="../dubai">2013</a>, <a href="../uae">2018</a>, 2023. Dubai is interesting because it is constantly growing and changing. Yes, there are many questions regarding the implementation of megaprojects, but in general the city and the country as a whole are moving in an interesting direction - not just selling oil, not just selling real estate, but making a place where you can do business and store money, alternative to the “Western world” (that is, approximately what you-know-who dreamed of achieving by forcing himself on neighboring countries). For me, of course, the minus of the UAE is that this is a country for people with more money than I have - even nomads are given a residence permit with an income of $5,000 or more, which is higher than in Europe. Although if I found a local job, I think I would happily live there, especially since I’m not bothered by areas with Indian food, but quite the opposite.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52787581865_acae0ae3d6_h.jpg"/>

<p>
We were able to see a little bit of Dubai from the plane. This is the palm tree island.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52787637213_15f190e5e1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It turned out that there was another larger palm tree even further from the center, and a third one was being built near the old city. But two additional palm trees were not completed, since it turned out that living on a palm tree is not particularly convenient: the water between the “leaves” stagnates, and a traffic jam is expected to form at the exit.
<p/>

<p>
This time I lived in the very center of Dubai, in the Deira area. The hotel cost $50, not cheap, but the room was very nice.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52787637128_3ebc1d0c5c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Deira has a huge number of all kinds of shops, I already wrote that it is like India without garbage.

In this area you can rent a bed in a hostel for just over $100 a month.

<p>
Last time I wrote not entirely correctly that Deira is the old part of Dubai. This is partly true, but the oldest part is on the other side of the river, where you can get for 1 dirham in cash on a boat like this.

From the highway to the sea there are residential low-rise areas. In the distance you can see man-made islands in the form of a world map, almost all of which are empty. There is a hotel on one island and a shrimp farm on the other.

The good thing about the Emirates is that it’s easy to find food from different countries, for example, Japanese, at any food court.

<h2>Ras al-Khaimah</h2>
<p>
I dedicated one day to visiting three emirates that I had never been to before. The first was Ras al-Khaimah (abbreviated RAK) - the northeasternmost emirate. Interestingly, the UAE initially were formed by six emirates, and the ruler of Ras al-Khaimah was unhappy that Abu Dhabi and Dubai had too much power. But immediately after the withdrawal of British colonial troops, Iran occupied two islands in the Persian Gulf that belonged to Ras al-Khaimah, and a couple of months later the sheikh changed his mind and joined the UAE. The islands are still under Iranian control.

Umm al-Quwain is the smallest and most rarely visited emirate. There are only buses from Ajman to the main city once an hour, I was one of only two passengers. You can also get off the bus going to/from Ras Al Khaimah on the highway.

<h2>Ajman</h2>

Ajman is the smallest of the seven emirates by area. It adjoins Sharjah to the east, essentially forming a single continuous agglomeration with Sharjah and Dubai. Dubai city buses go to Ajman.

<h2>Dibba</h2>
<p>
One day I went on a day trip by boat to Musandam, an exclave of Oman. You can drive there from two sides - along the shore of the Persian Gulf and along the shore of the Gulf of Oman. As I understand it, excursions are mainly from the east (Gulf of Oman), and we were allowed through the border in a simplified manner, without stamps and visas. The city of Dibba is divided by the border, the Omani part is called Dibba al-Baya, and the Emirati also consists of two parts: most of Dibba al-Fujairah belongs to the emirate of Fujairah, and a small piece near the border is called Dibba al-Hisn and is part of the emirate Sharjah.
