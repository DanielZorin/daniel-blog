<h1>Sweden: Stockholm, Uppsala</h1>
<i>18-20 April 2012</i>
<h2>Stockholm</h2>
<p>
Stockholm is located on a large number of islands. I tried to see as much as possible, in particular, in the central part of the city I went around everything.
On the most famous small island is the old town.
<p/>

<p>
There are narrow streets here.

Small courtyards.

Interesting house numbers above the doors.

<p>
And great transformers.
<p/>

<p>
There are kindergartens.
<p/>

<p>
Benches for strollers.
<p/>

<p>
What’s typical is that in Stockholm you can sit on any bench and get free Wi-Fi.
<p/>

<p>
You can also sit on the stairs, fortunately they are very clean
<p/>

<p>
The island north of the center (and south too) looks something like this.
<p/>

<p>
From here you can walk to the island, where the Vasa shipwreck museum and the Skansen open-air museum of Swedish architecture (which was closed due to winter) are located. There is an excellent telephone booth next to it.
<p/>

<p>
Between this island and the old town there are two islands, the purpose of which is to provide another excellent area for walking.
<p/>

<p>
On these islands there are some other institutions and even a small fort.

And when you reach the last cape, you see the following picture.

<p>
On the way back there is an example of modern art.

<p>
And finally, an island whose existence is truly a mystery. It is located somewhere between the north and the old city, next to it (but not through it) there is a road bridge, from which there is an exit here. There is only one unmarked building on the island. And, as is traditional for Sweden, not a single person was around.
<p/>

<p>
It is absolutely impossible to get lost in the center of Stockholm: on every corner there are always signs with street names and house numbers in a given block.
<p/>

I decided to walk from the northern part of the city to the royal palace of Drottningholm. The distance of 12 kilometers according to google maps did not frighten me. The territory marked on the tourist map of the city center soon ended, as a result I walked, knowing only the approximate direction, and made a detour through a couple of islands until I came across a map of the area hanging at some stop. As a result, 12 kilometers smoothly turned into 15.

<p>
The outskirts of Stockholm consist of a decent percentage of standard panel houses.

<p>
Unlike Russia, where they are usually left gray, in Sweden they prefer to paint them dark red.
<p/>

<p>
There is also a fairly significant presence of one-story houses. When you walk along it, it seems that it will never end.
<p/>

<p>
The area between the multi-storey buildings is well landscaped.
<p/>

<p>
On all the streets, including on the distant outskirts, there are always benches for tired travelers like me. In fact, there are practically no people on the streets there even during the day; there are mainly two categories: cyclists and runners. Sometimes there are those who go against the system.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256298364_408ab6926a_o.jpg">
<p>
All streets are neatly marked with bicycle paths and bicycle traffic lights. The pedestrian path is also marked with a pictogram. What struck me the most was the zebra crossing over the bike path.
<p/>

<p>
Finally, I reached the palace. Need I say that in April it doesn’t work and there are no people around?
<p/>

<p>
I walked another 40 minutes and got to the nearest metro station. The Stockholm metro, after all the enthusiasm expressed about it, disappointed me. Most stations are decorated like this:
<p/>

<p>
At a minimum it's like this:
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256301134_5753b77e4b_o.jpg">
<p>
The inside of the trains is comfortable, similar to electric trains in some European countries.
<p/>

<p>
After the 80 minutes allotted by the ticket, I got off at the opposite end of the city with the firm determination to walk about 10 kilometers home. There is a cemetery with the unpronounceable name Skogskyrkogården (unpronounceable because in Swedish, like in English, there is a lot of reduction, as a result it sounds not "skogskyrkogården", but something similar to "skuschukogon"). For some unknown reason, this place is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.
<p/>

<p>
Why, I have never been able to assess. Well, yes, there is a black obelisk.
<p/>

<p>
The way back ran through almost native landscapes of the southern outskirts.
<p/>

Here, migrant workers live in trailers.

And here, finally, is a high civilization!

On a dreary April day, I decided to go look at Stockholm University, since Google maps said that one of the buildings was not far from me. As I walked, the rain got stronger and stronger, I constantly solved the dilemma: go back or continue gritting my teeth in the rain, and eventually I reached my goal. It was Friday, but apparently in Sweden it is a non-school day, because there were fewer people in the building than in Moscow on Saturday evening. Mostly people sat with laptops at tables. What’s great is that no arrogant guards prevent you from going inside.

<p>
This was the building of the Faculty of Law. The stand indicates where to look for whom.
<p/>

<p>
The office is furnished, in my opinion, quite well.
<p/>

<p>
Exam results are posted on stands.

Hall with video projector. Moscow State University also has several of these.
<p/>

<p>
Regular classroom. We have similar ones at the Faculty of Economics. No one is afraid that some outsider like me will sneak in here and steal the computer standing in the corner, although theoretically the room can be locked with a key.

Electronic schedule. There are still some activities.

<h2>Uppsala</h2>
<p>
In the afternoon I went to the city of Uppsala, where the oldest Swedish university is located. The local government will give ours a head start.
<p/>

<p>
Again, no security guards. An empty auditorium with a projector, one of the very few classrooms that look like classrooms in this building. All main activities are located in other buildings, which in Uppsala, unlike Stockholm, are concentrated in one block.
<p/>

<p>
The large building directly opposite the castle was still closed from outsiders using an electronic lock that could be opened with a card, but I easily managed to get inside. There wasn't much space inside, with a few people working on laptops in a nice space in the middle of the second floor. I also took advantage of the moment and recharged my laptop a little.

<p>
While I was walking through the buildings, I couldn’t shake the feeling of a ghost town. There’s also the Faculty of Philosophy, where time seems to have stood still.
<p/>

Uppsala itself is mostly like the outskirts of Stockholm.
<p/>

<p>
But there are dispensers with a large selection of newspapers.
