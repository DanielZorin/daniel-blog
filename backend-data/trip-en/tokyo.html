<h1>Japan: Tokyo, Yokohama, Kamakura</h1>
<i>28-30 November, 1-2, 17 December 2017</i>
<h2>Tokyo</h2>
<p>
Tokyo is a prime example of a city with a complex structure, where there is no obvious main central part, but interesting areas and places are scattered throughout the territory. Therefore, I will describe it sequentially by district. In terms of administrative divisions of Japan, the city of Tokyo consists of 23 wards, and another 26 less densely built-up municipalities in the hills to the west, which used to be a separate prefecture. In fact, the entire Kanto region (Tokyo and 6 neighboring prefectures) is one very, very large city, but I will still consider cities in other prefectures, like Yokohama, separately. Of the 23 districts of Tokyo, about 8 are of greatest interest to a traveler. Let's start with the place where I lived - the Taito district.

I lived in a small house near the Minowa metro station. Here's my miniature yard.
<p/>

<p>
The area is purely residential, with older and newer houses. The newer ones are like these 3-4 floors.
<p/>

<p>
The older ones are like this.

An old wooden shed was nestled between two houses.

And this is a skyscraper by local standards.

<p>
The streets are very narrow, so often the sidewalks are simply drawn on the road.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254895642_475083c07a_o.jpg">
<p>
On a larger street, the sidewalk is fenced off.
<p/>

<p>
A shopping place (it says "Shop Mate"), but it only seems to be open on weekends as a market. On the right is the Christian Church. In general, there was a good supermarket within a 3-minute walk from my house, and a couple more were within a 10-15 minute radius, not counting the ubiquitous 7-11 and Lawson convenience stores.
<p/>

<p>
While walking around the area, I discovered the Sanraku Hotel. A sign at the entrance promises rooms with a TV, cold and hot water, and for only 2,200 yen (about $20). It turns out that in Japan you can also travel like in Southeast Asia and Korea, without booking accommodation, but you need to know in which area to look.

<p>
In every district of Tokyo there are maps of the district. This is not for tourists, but for orientation: it’s easy to understand which quarter is which. Only large streets have names, and addresses consist of the name of the block (in red on the map) and the block number (signed in numbers).

What exquisite inscriptions here! “Open air camping, sake drinking, and other behaviors that may be a nuisance to park visitors are prohibited by district regulations.”
<p/>

<p>
There is a sign on the asphalt that you cannot smoke while walking. Oddly enough, smoking is still widespread in Japan.
<p/>

Japanese traffic controllers stand at night with sticks that look like the swords of Star Wars antagonists.

The closest concentration of shops and restaurants to me was near Ueno Station (two subway stops). Trains from Narita Airport also arrive here.

The area is home to a zoo as well as an art museum designed by Le Corbusier and listed as a World Heritage Site.

One of the 23 districts of Tokyo is called "center", although in fact there is nothing particularly central in it, and the name is rather a tribute to tradition, because the business center was here in the first half of the 20th century. The neighboring district of Chiyoda, where the emperor’s residence is located, can be considered the historical center of Tokyo.
<p/>

The palace, of course, is closed to visitors; you can only view it from behind the moat.

Corner tower and its reflection. It's very common to see this in Japan because many castles are surrounded by water.

<p>
But the imperial gardens near the palace are open to everyone, although only during the day. I didn’t have time, but the next day in the morning I came here specially, and it was worth it.

I arrived at the perfect time - the golden autumn is not over yet, but the bulk of the tourists who came for it have already left.
<p/>

Autumn is the second most popular time to travel in Japan after spring, when the cherry blossoms bloom. It's quite hot here in summer.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255630966_470bcb56e7_o.jpg">
<p>
The autumn period is called "momiji", after the tree of the same name - the Japanese maple.

Not far from the Imperial Palace is Tokyo's main train station. Typically, train stations in Japan are not distinguished by expressive architecture - they have no architecture at all, because the station is an underground floor of a shopping center and does not have its own separate building. Tokyo Station is one of the exceptions.

Since this also includes participants of the Second World War, who distinguished themselves by lawlessness in China and other occupied countries, every visit of the Japanese Prime Minister to Yasukuni causes protests from China.

Another Buddhist temple (Tsukiji Honganji) is notable for the fact that it does not look like a Buddhist temple at all, but rather like some kind of palace or institution.
<p/>

The real center of life in Tokyo are two districts in the western part of the city: Shibuya and Shinjuku. This area has the most shopping, dining and nightlife options.

On one of the upper floors there is an observation deck, or rather two, because you can go into each of the towers. Admission there is free, but I stood in line for about 30 minutes to get to the elevator of the south tower.

Tokyo has an extensive subway and train system, which is also unusual for its incredible liberalization: within the city's administrative boundaries alone there are about four different subway providers, plus a monorail, plus several dozen companies that operate commuter trains to neighboring prefectures. However, it is very easy to pay as you go - the Pasmo pass is accepted by all operators, and not only in Tokyo, but also in all other big cities of the country.
<p/>

<p>
Within Tokyo, I traveled almost exclusively by Tokyo Metro, a private subway with 9 lines. There is also the state-owned Toei subway, which has 4 lines. One trip costs somewhere from 200 yen, but it is obviously cheaper to buy a day ticket for 600 yen on the Tokyo metro or 900 yen on both subways. However, I only used the first one; this only lengthened some of the routes a little.

Of the interesting places within the city of Tokyo, the subway does not go to Odaiba Island. You can get there via the lines of two other carriers - Rinkai and Yurikamome. The Yurikamome Line starts near Tsukiji Market.

Gundam is the oldest and most popular robot fighting franchise. The first anime about Gundams was released back in 1979; since then, many more series have been created, almost all of which take place in different universes with different heroes, sharing only the approximate design of the robots and their names, as well as some traditions of the franchise, such as the stable presence of a blond man in a mask among the antagonists.

In recent years, I haven’t really followed new anime, so most of the posters were unfamiliar to me. It turned out that the Japanese are 99% only interested in fresh stuff; old anime, which we consider “classics” or “pop” (such as Death Note or Code Geass), do not sell much.

Yokohama is not just a residential area, but an important historical city: in the period after the discovery of Japan in the 19th century, it was home to foreign diplomats and merchants, close to the imperial capital of Tokyo, but still separate. A parallel can be drawn with <a href="http://goo.gl/5oykE8">Beijing and Tianjin</a> in China.

I arrived at Yokohama Main Station. Many lines from different companies in all directions depart from different platforms.

Yokohama also has a metro, even two, one with two lines, the other with one.
<p/>

This metro station is in the old part of the port, as evidenced by the panel at the exit.
<p/>

There are several buildings of the 19th century, in European style.

Then there was a short period when the Japanese copied European architecture (a similar phenomenon occurred, for example, in <a href="http://goo.gl/4kcv6j">Thailand</a>).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256513639_954dd6af6b_o.jpg">
<p>
The building commemorates the 50th anniversary of the port. Like many 19th-century buildings around Tokyo, it was nearly destroyed by the 1923 earthquake.

For some reason, the most luxurious houses with a garden are at the very end of the street, without a view of the sea.

The city of Kamakura, famous for its ancient temples, is just half an hour's drive from Yokohama.

Garbage collection is complex. There is a schedule for which days what type of garbage is taken out, and it needs to be put in these collecting boxes by morning. The poster says that you should not throw away garbage in areas other than your own.

A rickshaw carries tourists. Yes, Japan was once poor, like <a href="https://goo.gl/7tgwJw">Calcutta</a> is now, and foot rickshaws were common here.

It is interesting because, according to legend, the local spring helps to multiply money, so people put coins or even banknotes in special bowls with a handle and lower them under water.
