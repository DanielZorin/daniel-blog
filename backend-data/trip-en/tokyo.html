<h1>Japan: Tokyo, Yokohama, Kamakura</h1>
<i>28-30 November, 1-2, 17 December 2017</i>
<h2>Tokyo</h2>
<p>
Tokyo is a prime example of a city with a complex structure, where there is no obvious main central part, but interesting areas and places are scattered throughout the territory. Therefore, I will describe it sequentially by district. In terms of administrative divisions of Japan, the city of Tokyo consists of 23 wards, and another 26 less densely built-up municipalities in the hills to the west, which used to be a separate prefecture. In fact, the entire Kanto region (Tokyo and 6 neighboring prefectures) is one very, very large city, but I will still consider cities in other prefectures, like Yokohama, separately. Of the 23 districts of Tokyo, about 8 are of greatest interest to a traveler. Let's start with the place where I lived - the Taito district.

<p>
I lived in a small house near the Minowa metro station. Here's my miniature yard.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255632781_dd5848e2fc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The area is purely residential, with older and newer houses. The newer ones are like these 3-4 floors.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255624991_7666f4432f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The older ones are like this.

<p>
An old wooden shed was nestled between two houses.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255625066_166552a21b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And this is a skyscraper by local standards.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257890950_4ab2f58115_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The streets are very narrow, so often the sidewalks are simply drawn on the road.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254895642_888931130a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On a larger street, the sidewalk is fenced off.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255835698_7c49bdbc53_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A shopping place (it says "Shop Mate"), but it only seems to be open on weekends as a market. On the right is the Christian Church. In general, there was a good supermarket within a 3-minute walk from my house, and a couple more were within a 10-15 minute radius, not counting the ubiquitous 7-11 and Lawson convenience stores.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256678695_c5eaffce28_h.jpg"/>
<p>
While walking around the area, I discovered the Sanraku Hotel. A sign at the entrance promises rooms with a TV, cold and hot water, and for only 2,200 yen (about $20). It turns out that in Japan you can also travel like in Southeast Asia and Korea, without booking accommodation, but you need to know in which area to look.
<p/>

<p>
In every district of Tokyo there are maps of the district. This is not for tourists, but for orientation: it’s easy to understand which quarter is which. Only large streets have names, and addresses consist of the name of the block (in red on the map) and the block number (signed in numbers).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255830048_2e281de72f_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p>
What exquisite inscriptions here! “Open air camping, sake drinking, and other behaviors that may be a nuisance to park visitors are prohibited by district regulations.”
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255830213_5bf04e00dd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a sign on the asphalt that you cannot smoke while walking. Oddly enough, smoking is still widespread in Japan.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256671105_02591ecdb1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Japanese traffic controllers stand at night with sticks that look like the swords of Star Wars antagonists.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256379984_31f5786c6b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The same sticks hang at the entrance to the police station.
<p/>

<p>
The police are looking for them. Bottom left is the traffic accident counter for yesterday, in all of Tokyo there were 0 dead and 115 injured.
<p/>

<p>
Metro station. Entry to small non-transfer stations is usually modest.
<p/>

<p>
The closest concentration of shops and restaurants to me was near Ueno Station (two subway stops). Trains from Narita Airport also arrive here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255624701_ce83c2c297_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the station passages, homeless people set up neat cardboard houses for themselves.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255829873_eed0c47f39_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The area is home to a zoo as well as an art museum designed by Le Corbusier and listed as a World Heritage Site.

<p>
A restaurant where you can buy Kobe beef. The price is about 100 dollars per kilogram.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254895392_4675089a1c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I had a more modest dinner, but still not bad.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255630691_ba71b97e68_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Also in the Taito area near Asakusa Station is the oldest temple in Tokyo - Senso-ji.

<p>
One of the 23 districts of Tokyo is called "center", although in fact there is nothing particularly central in it, and the name is rather a tribute to tradition, because the business center was here in the first half of the 20th century. The neighboring district of Chiyoda, where the emperor’s residence is located, can be considered the historical center of Tokyo.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255835863_2164f62b8f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The palace, of course, is closed to visitors; you can only view it from behind the moat.
<p/>

<p>
Corner tower and its reflection. It's very common to see this in Japan because many castles are surrounded by water.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256379544_6af2b464c5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But the imperial gardens near the palace are open to everyone, although only during the day. I didn’t have time, but the next day in the morning I came here specially, and it was worth it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254901347_02920cc901_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I arrived at the perfect time - the golden autumn is not over yet, but the bulk of the tourists who came for it have already left.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255630866_80a8691fab_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Autumn is the second most popular time to travel in Japan after spring, when the cherry blossoms bloom. It's quite hot here in summer.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255630966_f4fa1008dc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The autumn period is called "momiji", after the tree of the same name - the Japanese maple.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255835953_be10ab5cd0_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256380284_50f0f4db9c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is it with bright red leaves. The leaves are approximately the same as those of a regular maple, only three times smaller.
<p/>

<p/>

<p>
Momiji season is around November to early December.

<p>
Inside the garden you can also climb the walls.
<p/>

<p>
Here are the remains of Edo Castle, destroyed during World War II.

<p>
Not far from the Imperial Palace is Tokyo's main train station. Typically, train stations in Japan are not distinguished by expressive architecture - they have no architecture at all, because the station is an underground floor of a shopping center and does not have its own separate building. Tokyo Station is one of the exceptions.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254897032_cc970fd651_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254897067_30b2ee7e15_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are also many high-rise buildings in this area, mostly office buildings rather than retail ones.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255835008_835a9c9251_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256379389_cecc58909c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Unlike other high-rise areas, there is little advertising here.
<p/>

<p>
A bit like America.

<p>
Yasukuni is an infamous shrine dedicated to all who died fighting for Japan.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255630396_e223f07fa2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Since this also includes participants of the Second World War, who distinguished themselves by lawlessness in China and other occupied countries, every visit of the Japanese Prime Minister to Yasukuni causes protests from China.
<p/>

<p/>

<p>
There is also a military museum here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254900977_4c3109d617_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Another Buddhist temple (Tsukiji Honganji) is notable for the fact that it does not look like a Buddhist temple at all, but rather like some kind of palace or institution.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255633406_facc8b3689_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The Tsukiji Market is also located in this area.
<p/>

<p>
Some tourists specially come here at 5 am to watch how freshly caught tuna is sold. I think it's not much fun, especially at 5am, so I didn't go.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256679460_44d012fef9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are also a lot of people during the day.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256382964_b733f8fde1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Fruit stand. Fruits in Japan are absurdly expensive, just like in Korea, they play the role of gifts instead of flowers. One apple - 600 yen ($5).
<p/>

<p>
A stone's throw from here is the Ginza district, home to luxury clothing stores.
<p/>

<p>
Over the weekend, the main street of Ginza was closed and turned into a pedestrian street.
<p/>

<p>
In one of the shopping centers you can go out onto the roof, from which you can see in all directions.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254904147_95a1e1fffa_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The roof, however, is not too high; you can mainly see Ginza.

<p>
The real center of life in Tokyo are two districts in the western part of the city: Shibuya and Shinjuku. This area has the most shopping, dining and nightlife options.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256382164_edb7e04aeb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The famous intersection near Shibuya Station is the Tokyo equivalent of <a href="../new-york">Times Square</a>.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255625496_74642cada9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
During the day there are not a lot of people here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255625591_738037ef3f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You can also cross the street diagonally.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254895937_a887164e04_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Such diagonal crossings are very common in Japan.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255625391_62f1e94768_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It's much more fun here in the evening.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256382069_ef2b03f902_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The crowd pours out into the intersection.
<p/>

<p>
And fills it.

<p>
Near Shibuya Station there is a monument to the dog Hachiko, who waited here for 10 years for the deceased owner.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256374374_8e0d5c3b6f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The streets of Shibuya are crowded with all sorts of establishments, each with its own sign.
<p/>

<p>
There may be six restaurants in one building, each on its own floor, and all will have their own signs. In Europe, only the first, or at most second, floor is usually allocated for business.

Before entering the temple there is always a place for ritual washing of hands and face with such long scoops.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255625956_a5cae2521c_h.jpg"/>

To the side of the temple is the large Yoyogi Park.

After traveling to the south of Japan, I arrived in Tokyo on the last day before flying to Moscow; the golden autumn was already over.

On weekends you can see cosplayers and representatives of all sorts of subcultures here, but I didn’t get there then, apparently it was already a little cold for cosplay.
<p/>

<p>
Taxi. Surprisingly, there are a lot of them in Tokyo, despite the fact that the price is absurdly high - almost 3 dollars per kilometer, when even in America it is no more than 2.

On one of the upper floors there is an observation deck, or rather two, because you can go into each of the towers. Admission there is free, but I stood in line for about 30 minutes to get to the elevator of the south tower.

I came down from the observation deck and went to have lunch, passing by the north tower, I saw that there was no line there at all. I entered the elevator, and now I was already in the second observation room. From here you can see Shinjuku better; the northern tower itself is not in the way.

Tokyo has an extensive subway and train system, which is also unusual for its incredible liberalization: within the city's administrative boundaries alone there are about four different subway providers, plus a monorail, plus several dozen companies that operate commuter trains to neighboring prefectures. However, it is very easy to pay as you go - the Pasmo pass is accepted by all operators, and not only in Tokyo, but also in all other big cities of the country.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254901092_5ae940dde0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Within Tokyo, I traveled almost exclusively by Tokyo Metro, a private subway with 9 lines. There is also the state-owned Toei subway, which has 4 lines. One trip costs somewhere from 200 yen, but it is obviously cheaper to buy a day ticket for 600 yen on the Tokyo metro or 900 yen on both subways. However, I only used the first one; this only lengthened some of the routes a little.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254896312_d71e4d2cf8_h.jpg"/>

Of the interesting places within the city of Tokyo, the subway does not go to Odaiba Island. You can get there via the lines of two other carriers - Rinkai and Yurikamome. The Yurikamome Line starts near Tsukiji Market.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254902392_2adb2cc424_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Gundam is the oldest and most popular robot fighting franchise. The first anime about Gundams was released back in 1979; since then, many more series have been created, almost all of which take place in different universes with different heroes, sharing only the approximate design of the robots and their names, as well as some traditions of the franchise, such as the stable presence of a blond man in a mask among the antagonists.
<p/>

What is Japan without anime? The Akihabara area is associated with anime and computer games (as well as technology and electronics).

<p>
In recent years, I haven’t really followed new anime, so most of the posters were unfamiliar to me. It turned out that the Japanese are 99% only interested in fresh stuff; old anime, which we consider “classics” or “pop” (such as Death Note or Code Geass), do not sell much.
<p/>

In addition to Akihabara, there is another area with approximately the same anime paraphernalia stores - Ikebukuro. It is sometimes called "Akihabara for girls" because there is a greater emphasis on anime and games whose target audience is predominantly female.

<h2>Yokohama</h2>
<p>
Yokohama is the second largest city in Japan; in fact, it and Tokyo have long merged. You can get to Yokohama via several different railway lines, including the nationwide JR. The cheapest option is the Toyoko Line (TOkyo-YOKOhama) from Shibuya Station. Yokohama is not just a residential area, but an important historical city: in the period after the discovery of Japan in the 19th century, it was home to foreign diplomats and merchants, close to the imperial capital of Tokyo, but still separate. A parallel can be drawn with <a href="../tianjin">Beijing and Tianjin</a> in China.

I arrived at Yokohama Main Station. Many lines from different companies in all directions depart from different platforms.
<p/>

There are bas-reliefs at the entrance to the station.

This is the modern part of the city, there are multi-storey office buildings and shops.

<p>
A huge number of interchanges and transitions at different levels, I had difficulty figuring out how to get out of this maze.

Yokohama also has a metro, even two, one with two lines, the other with one.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255035167_75312796d1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This metro station is in the old part of the port, as evidenced by the panel at the exit.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255035212_e7e65ac89f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are several buildings of the 19th century, in European style.
<p/>

<p>
Then there was a short period when the Japanese copied European architecture (a similar phenomenon occurred, for example, in <a href="../ayutthaya">Thailand</a>).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256513639_bdda0ffcd8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The building commemorates the 50th anniversary of the port. Like many 19th-century buildings around Tokyo, it was nearly destroyed by the 1923 earthquake.

Across the river is the Yamate area, where foreigners settled in the 19th century after the opening of Japan.
<p/>

First you need to climb the hills.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255764731_51b98161c2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a whole area of ​​all kinds of mansions.

For some reason, the most luxurious houses with a garden are at the very end of the street, without a view of the sea.

<h2>Kamakura</h2>
<p>
The city of Kamakura, famous for its ancient temples, is just half an hour's drive from Yokohama.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257285150_ab39fd9d04_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The city itself is quite ordinary.
<p/>

Someone's yard.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256441973_dee4856060_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are mainly three temples visited in Kamakura. The first of them is Hase-dera.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255513187_3dc4d841bc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You are not allowed to take photographs inside; there is a huge statue of the goddess Guanyin (Kannon in Japanese).
<p/>

<p/>

<p>
There are also many smaller statues here.

And a small cave with statues.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256442293_d7ce7e1f5c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The temple is on a hill, so from there you can look down on Kamakura and the ocean shore.

And of course a beautiful garden with a pond.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255513247_239044218e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The second important temple is Kotoku-in, where a 13th century bronze Buddha statue sits.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256991154_d4c9202d21_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are windows behind the Buddha.
<p/>

<p>
Back to the station I took a circuitous route through the hills. There are residential areas with typically Japanese houses.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256991259_4db4aa69d5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Garbage collection is complex. There is a schedule for which days what type of garbage is taken out, and it needs to be put in these collecting boxes by morning. The poster says that you should not throw away garbage in areas other than your own.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256442508_612c9619a9_h.jpg"/>

A rickshaw carries tourists. Yes, Japan was once poor, like <a href="../calcutta">Calcutta</a> is now, and foot rickshaws were common here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257285310_c161343e7f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Hidden in the hills is the Zeni-arai-benten temple.
<p/>

<p>
It is interesting because, according to legend, the local spring helps to multiply money, so people put coins or even banknotes in special bowls with a handle and lower them under water.

It was already getting dark, the temple was closing, but I managed to walk a little around the surrounding gardens with ponds.
