<h1>China: Suzhou, Hangzhou, Shanghai</h1>
<i>13-23 May 2015</i>
<h2>Suzhou</h2>
<p>
In the region where the Yangtze flows into the sea, from ancient times there were many cities and villages on canals, which were needed for agriculture. Now around Shanghai there are several such old cities that have been turned into tourist attractions with paid entrance to the territory (like <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/395517.html">Fenghuang</a>). Suzhou is on a different level, because it is a very large city, and even the central part, which is a square island between the canals, is so huge that it takes an hour and a half to walk from one end to the other. There are canals everywhere here, and not just in the small boating section.

Some kind of residential area.

<p>
Mostly, the houses face the canals with their backs and their fronts face the street. This is different from the original Venice.

Previously, they used to attach pieces of paper with prayers to Buddhist temples for good luck, but now they hang train tickets.

Suzhou is famous not only for its canals, but for its gardens that are even included in the UNESCO list. For this reason, entry to most gardens is quite expensive. I already had a good idea of what a Chinese garden was, so in Suzhou I set myself an unusual goal: to see as many gardens as possible, spending as little money as possible.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256325029_679ab9c4b4_o.jpg">
<p>
Here is a nice garden not far from the city gates.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256620870_687c53bd93_o.jpg">
<p>
The garden is public, so you can dry your clothes on the branches.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255780708_51299440fb_o.jpg">
<p>
And even on wires.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254845392_1874d2367d_o.jpg">
<p>
Now this looks more like a solid garden.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255780198_9d856f1af7_o.jpg">
<p>
But still, public gardens are a little different; a real garden should be private and behind a high wall, so that no one can see from the street. There is one in the back of a block with narrow alleys, entrance is only 10 yuan.

Suzhou is such a cozy city that even the panel houses here are cozy. This is a courtyard.

The station is located interestingly - when you leave the building, there is a moat in front of you, and behind it a wall with a gate, but without a bridge. Bridge is on the side.

On the second day we visited the Suzhou Museum. It is interesting primarily for the building that was designed by Yuming Bei, best known as the architect of the Louvre pyramid.
<p/>

<p>
The exhibition in the museum is not particularly rich. In the far wing there was a room where the private collection of one person was exhibited, and so there were more exhibits in it than in the rest of the museum.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255575881_1788cd779c_o.jpg">

You can still look at modern Chinese painting.

Usually people visit Suzhou (and Hangzhou) from Shanghai on a day trip, but I decided to be original and leave Shanghai for the very end. There are direct trains from Suzhou to Hangzhou, although non-high-speed ones transit through Shanghai.
</p>
<h2>Hangzhou</h2>
<p>
People travel to Hangzhou from Shanghai to see the West Lake. In the program "Heads and Tails" this city was even called the outskirts of Shanghai. Well, of course, it only takes 40 minutes by high-speed train, but Hangzhou is also a metropolis of ten million people, there’s not only the lake there, but I’ll start with it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256912269_c93f02e670_o.jpg">
<p>
West Lake has been a source of inspiration for Chinese poets and artists since ancient times. Gradually, a canonical list of the 10 most beautiful views from different parts of the lake at different times of the year emerged. The lake is quite large; it will take three to four hours to walk around it.
<p/>

This is where those strange tentacle-like things that are depicted on the 1 yuan bill are located, although you can only see them up close from a boat.

On the other hand, the views of clouds over the lake are also quite good.

Also, because of the rain, I stayed in Hangzhou for three days instead of two and found a couple of pretty nice spots.

The road partly follows the shore, partly goes along two long roads of bridges and small islands, somewhat shortening the path across the lake.

To the east of the lake there are tea plantations where Longjing tea is grown.
<p/>

Tea plantations look similar to rice fields, and bushes are also planted in terraces.

I've never seen tea grow. This is a bush with green leaves. The leaves at the top ripen in the sun and turn light green, which is when they are harvested.

Hangzhou has <i>the very place</i> that I wanted to see - the Chinese copy of Paris. I was 100% sure that it was in Shanghai, in the same place as the copies of Amsterdam, London and Stockholm, but Paris is a different story. Chinese Paris is called Tianducheng and is located far on the outskirts: I took three buses from the lake, and took a bus back to the final metro station.

Usually in all cities I settled in the city center near the main station, but in Hangzhou the train arrived at a new station, and in general the city is not at all compact, so I traveled quite a bit by bus and subway. Once I was traveling by bus somewhere not very far from the center and found another chic Chinese-style church. With the inscription "Jesus loves you".

The Great Canal of China begins in Hangzhou! I have been to several cities through which it passes, but everywhere it was somewhere on the outskirts, and here I just lived nearby. This is an outstanding engineering structure that runs from Hangzhou all the way to Beijing. It was built long before the Panama and Suez Canals - back in the 13th century (and construction began 2000 years before that).
<p/>

<p>
Due to the fact that I did not walk around the city on foot at all, but moved around all the time by transport, the impression of Hangzhou turned out to be somewhat not very integral. It seems like I’ve been to many places, but they are perceived separately, not lining up into a whole continuous picture, like when you walk around the city on foot. Many photographs were taken somewhere on intermediate transfers.

Of all the Chinese cities, Hangzhou turned out to be the most “American” - not pedestrian friendly and strict. This city is definitely worth a visit, and not just for the lake.

<h2>Shanghai</h2>
<p>
Shanghai was the 50th city I visited in China. It's hard to surprise with anything in this situation. Indeed, a lot was familiar: multi-storey residential complexes, slums, street trading, copies of European architecture, tourist streets with newly built pagodas, multi-storey overpasses. Shanghai takes everything that China has and makes it perfect.
<p/>

<p>
Yes, it’s hard to resist taking a photo like this. By the way, for a long time Pudong (the area with skyscrapers) was a ghost town with half-empty offices, and 20 years ago there was nothing there at all.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256536125_e535a1a0b1_o.jpg">

Honestly speaking, Shanghai “on average” looks something like this:

Until the 19th century, Shanghai was a small city; it began to develop only when it became a European colony. Therefore, there is no special antiquity here. At most, the ruins are a hundred years old.

Tour groups are brought here because in the middle there is the Yuyuan Garden - a good opportunity to see a real Chinese garden for those who do not have enough time to travel to Suzhou.

There are an order of magnitude more foreign tourists in Shanghai than in other cities. Souvenirs for them, such as magnets, are also sold here (magnets are not sold in an ordinary Chinese city, even at souvenir stalls). I wonder who buys magnets with Saddam Hussein?

This is also the only place where wheels for boots are sold. Andrei Bednyakov once went astray, buying it for as much as 90 yuan, then he lowered the price to 30, but even 30 is an inflated price, because they easily offered me for 20. They also sell selfie sticks and flying dolls.

I reached Pudong somewhere on the fifth day. The tallest building - Shanghai Tower, the second tallest building in the world - has not yet been opened, although the outside has already been completed. You can climb the two adjacent ones, although it’s not cheap.

There are cities in which the panorama is beautiful due to the relief (for example, <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/248059.html">Rio</a> and <a href="http://juan.livejournal .com/396016.html">Chongqing</a>). Shanghai is completely flat, but here there are 20  floor buildings all the way to the horizon, something like this is not found anywhere else, even in New York.

In Shanghai, as in Beijing, it is very difficult to find cheap housing. Foreigners are categorically not accommodated anywhere. Again I had to resort to the help of agoda.com, however, this time the reception did not agree to accommodate me at the online price just like that, I had to book directly in the lobby from my phone. The room cost 120 yuan ($20), the most expensive in China. They even gave out vouchers for breakfast! In expensive hotels, breakfast is usually free, but I find this very rarely. Breakfast turned out to be very strange - there was a lot of spicy vegetarian food, and no meat, no fresh vegetables, no fruits. Who might like to eat spicy salads at 9 am, I don’t know.
The hotel façade was full of kitsch.

There is such an interesting place on Nanjing Street. They sell pieces of meat in some special sauce, sooooo tasty, but incredibly expensive.

12.50 yuan per 50 grams, i.e. 250 yuan ($40) per kilogram is the cheapest there is. But - near the stall they always give you small piece to taste, so while walking around the center of Shanghai, you can try it many times. I wonder if they have such a high conversion of promos into purchases, or such a high margin that they can give out samples so easily?

It’s enough to say two facts about Shanghai’s transport. Firstly, when you take the metro, they show fish behind the glass doors.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256536940_50f4498c35_o.jpg">
<p>
Secondly, there is the fastest train in the world, reaching a speed of 400 kilometers per hour, but not always: at certain times (which, of course, I was in) the speed is only 300, like standard Chinese high-speed trains.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256539195_0c66007434_o.jpg">
<p>
Since the fare is 40 yuan, this is not a very practical way to get to the airport unless you are a business person for whom half an hour is a matter of principle. The Maglev station is not in the center, you still need to get to it by metro, but exactly the same metro line ultimately goes to the same airport.

In 2001, the “One City, Nine Towns” project was launched in Shanghai. The idea was to construct areas that copy the architecture of different countries. I have already been to Nanjing “Venice” and Hangzhou “Paris”, and in Shanghai the choice is even greater: London, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Germany, Canada, Italy - this is what seems to be complete. Unfortunately, all these areas are very far from the center, and not all of them even have metro access, and traveling two hours one way in one direction with transfers is too long, so the program had to be significantly limited. The most popular of these areas is Thames town, which copies London, but it is the farthest from the center. To start with, I chose Amsterdam, which is located far in the north, but within walking distance of the metro. Chinese Amsterdam is called Gaoqiao.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255493106_d3b8f12839_o.jpg">

Having already seen various similar places, I can say that Amsterdam did not turn out very well. Firstly, it doesn’t look very similar, it pales in comparison. And in real Amsterdam, air conditioners are not installed on facades.
