<h2>Toulouse</h2>
<p>
Let's see what a higher education institution in France looks like.
<p/>

<p>
France has communism, so education is free. There are three universities in Toulouse, according to French tradition they are called Toulouse 1, Toulouse 2 and Toulouse 3, and there are also many higher educational institutions called “schools” (ecole). Toulouse-3 includes faculties of natural sciences, Toulouse-2 - most of the humanities, Toulouse-1 - legal and economic sciences.

<p>
This building houses the Toulouse School of Economics (TSE), a highly respected institute, one of the best in economics in the world. TSE administratively joined the University of Toulouse 1 in 2011. By the way, education there is in English, so fluency in French is not necessary, but the admission process is very strict, and a significant portion of students do not graduate.
<p/>

<p>
TSE is located in a former tobacco factory building; there is even an inscription on the facade.

At the entrance to Moscow State University, you will be greeted by a redneck security officer who will closely examine your pass, so that God forbid the enemies of the Motherland do not find out the super-secret nanodevelopments of spiritual bonds at the faculty of who knows what. There are no checks when entering TSE; anyone can enter.

At first glance, it seems that stealing a projector is easy, but I think there are surveillance cameras for such cases.

In the toilet there is a fiery call to keep clean. "You are in society - be polite and think about others."

The main difference between the approach to teaching in France and in Russia is the following. In Russia, students are traditionally given such a volume of information that it is obviously impossible to study, and even less necessary. Often, exam papers give meaningless questions on encyclopedic knowledge that require memorizing textbooks rather than understanding the subject. The result of this is deplorable: cheating is considered the norm of life, and even teachers turn a blind eye to it, nothing is left in the head, and 99% of graduates don’t even really know the first-year materials (calculus, hello!). In France, cheating is considered a mortal sin; those found guilty are excommunicated from higher education for various periods, and the court record is posted on a special board of shame.
<p/>

<p>
For the discovery of a telephone or crib sheets, they are excommunicated for six months, but if the culprit also managed to use these things for their intended purpose, then one and a half to two years. The sentences are highlighted with a felt-tip pen.
<p/>

<p>
After studying, it’s not a sin to have some fun. Toulouse is considered a city of youth and students. They sell marijuana here (Arnaud Bernard Square). Muddy types in the distance near the entrances - this is it.
<p/>

<p>
Toulouse has even banned drinking alcohol on the streets, but no one is observing the ban, especially in the area where the most popular bars are located. Bar "Color of Panties".
<p/>

<p>
Bar "Saint Breasts" (a word play, in French saint and seins sound the same). Unfortunately, I was caught in some of the worst weather Toulouse has ever seen, and because of the rain, no one was there.

The toilet located on the same square was also empty.

Toulouse is the pink city. The houses were built from local clay, which is why they have this color. Toulouse is simply the perfect city for walking. Every turn is charming.

As is tradition, I won’t spoil anyone’s impressions by posting photos of the main attractions. I’ll just hint at a few interesting places. Firstly, you can look at the panorama of Toulouse from the roof of the Galeries Lafayette store.

The bridge over the Garonne is interesting because there are holes made in it so that it doesn't collapse during floods.

I would like to make special mention of social housing-commieblocks. The idea of such structures appeared in France (and was implemented in Russia). In the turbulent 20s and 30s, leftist architects talked about how great it would be if, instead of separate isolated houses, all people lived in a common house and walked together along the corridors. There were revolutionary ideas like to demolish the entire center of Paris and build it up with such blocks. The idea didn't work out.

<h2>Road trip</h2>
<p>
When you hear the word “village” in Russia, you immediately imagine hell: dilapidated huts, broken roads, life in a heap of dirt and manure, garbage thrown right at your feet, the population is aggressive, lazy and has lost the remnants of humanity. There is nothing like this in France. Visually, the French village differs from the city only in size - both streets quickly end up in a field. Of course, a significant role in this is played by the fact that in France there is work not only in Paris.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257144190_778367ed1d_o.jpg">
<p>
It should be noted that 99% of travelers with cars, although proud of their “freedom” from train schedules, hardly use it, moving mainly between large cities, where it is inefficient and financially unreasonable (if there are less than four of you traveling in one car). The car should be used to travel to places where public transport cannot reach. For example, you can, in principle, get to each of the villages described below by bus, but it runs 1-2 times a day (the schedule is tailored to those who go to school), and you probably won’t be able to visit several places at once in a day.
<p/>

<p>
The first village is called Fourquevaux. As usual, it stands around the church.
<p/>

Even small villages erect monuments.

<p>
So don’t think that only in Russia everyone is obsessed with the Second World War. In France, the First World War plays a similar role; in any village there will be a monument with the names of the fallen soldiers.
<p/>

It has its own bakery. Is there a bakery in any Russian village? No! Once upon a time, people baked their own bread, but this art has been lost. Now a truck travels through the villages once a day, selling bread. This is in the best case, in the worst case you will have to buy the day before yesterday’s bread at the general store.
