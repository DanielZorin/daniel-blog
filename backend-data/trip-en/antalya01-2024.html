<h2>Antalya</h2>
<p>
In January I spent almost 10 days in Antalya, with a lot of free time in between, so I explored almost everything I had not seen before in this wonderful city.

I walked around the center of Antalya again, of course.

I rode the old tram for the first time. The fare there is the same as on a regular one, and the transfer is free (unlike transferring from a tram to a bus). But it comes once every half hour.

There were still two museums in the center that I had not visited. The first is the ethnography museum. The entrance is free.

I accidentally discovered another museum close to the center - on the site of an ancient necropolis. It looks like it was only recently opened.
<p/>

There is no access to the necropolis itself yet, although paths have been made.

I have already been to two waterfalls in Antalya (upper and lower Duden), but there is also a third one - Kurşunlu. It is so far away that I thought you could only get there by car, but then I looked up the route and found out that a bus actually goes there. First I went by tram.

In addition to museums and attractions, I visited restaurants in Antalya. At first I ate next door to the place where I lived on the outskirts, and there, as usual, there was exclusively Turkish food. I ate my fill of Iskender kebabs.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537279373_5a27053738_o.jpg" >
<p>
After that, I started looking on maps for restaurants with different cuisines. Since Antalya is a large and touristy city, there are such restaurants, although not very many (there are more in Istanbul). The first was a Korean restaurant in the Lara area.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53536212947_c5a73cab42_o.jpg" >
<p>
The food is excellent and authentic. Dishes cost 200-250 liras (7-9 dollars).

The Uzbek-Kyrgyz restaurant is simply excellent! It is located in the very center, although a little in the side streets.
<p/>

The prices are downright low, at the level of a Turkish food court.

I didn’t find a Chinese restaurant in Antalya (there was one, but it was closed, perhaps for the winter). There are Japanese ones in the form of sushi, although they are called pan-Asian. I chose My Asia on Konyaalti beach and enjoyed the views along the way.

<p/>

<p>
The rolls were quite good, and the ramen was very good. The prices turned out to be low - for all this I paid 600 liras ($20), usually sushi in Turkey is much more expensive.
<p/>

<p>
Finally I visited an Indian restaurant. I noticed it a year and a half ago, walking around Antalya, but it has a strange schedule - works only after 14-30. I came later on purpose.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537515880_a3b328efea_o.jpg" >
<p>
There is excellent authentic Indian and Pakistani food here. The prices are reasonable - dishes cost about 200-250 liras. Chicken karahi:

There is another Indian restaurant five minutes from here, but it is in a pass-through location and the prices there are one and a half to two times higher.

Close to where I lived was Dokuma Park (and the tram station of the same name). This park was made on the territory of a former silk-spinning factory, and is now literally filled with all sorts of museums and other attractions.

What attracted me most was the miniature park. There is a similar one in Istanbul, but it's far away from the center, so I never got there. And here it is also free. Hagia Sophia greets you at the entrance.
