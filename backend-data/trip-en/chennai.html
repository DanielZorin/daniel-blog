<h1>India: Thiruvananthapuram, Kanyakumari, Madurai, Tiruchirappalli, Ponicherry, Chennai</h1>

<h2>Thiruvananthapuram</h2>
<p>
The city with the long name Thiruvananthapuram (formerly called Trivandrum) would be completely unremarkable if not for one recent event. In 2011, the largest treasure in history was found here - more than one hundred thousand items made of gold and precious stones, worth at least a trillion dollars. These treasures were collected for many centuries by the rulers of these lands and accumulated in the basements of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple.

<p>
In 2011, five basements were opened, and one, the largest, has not yet been opened, but they found out that there are two more basements below. So there's probably a lot more treasure out there than we know.
<p/>

<p>
From the outside you wouldn’t be able to tell that in the basement you could literally swim in gold.

<p>
Security measures are, of course, enhanced - foreigners are not allowed inside, and Indians cannot even bring a mobile phone.

<h2>Nagercoil</h2>
<p>
This small city with a population of only 200 thousand is located near the border of the states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. I had a layover there and walked around the city a bit, although there isn't much to see in Nagercoil.

<p>
Judging by the guidebooks, the main attraction of Nagercoil is the Nagaraja Temple, after which the city is named.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257268829_2db18c7414_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Yes, this is a temple in honor of the naga (the monster from Heroes of might and magic), statues of which can so often be found in temples in some Southeast Asian countries.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255793857_d9e681e26c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The temple is more than modest.
<p/>

<p>
Movie posters. In the south, they make films in local languages, primarily in Tamil, and not only watch Bollywood productions in Hindi.

The Nagercoil area is the end of the Western Ghats, the mountains that run along the southwest coast of India, separating the very wet coastal regions from the fairly dry areas in the east.

<h2>Kanyakumari</h2>
<p>
I have reached the southernmost point of India! From here the only way is north.

There is a striped temple on Cape Comorin; people come here to swim in the waters of the Indian Ocean.

<p>
But in general, in Kanyakumari, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was in a half-abandoned Soviet sanatorium in Crimea. There are the same statues here, and they also haven’t been repaired for 40 years.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256995389_1f6226a449_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The same embankment.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256995024_aa55608907_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The same long rows of stalls with all sorts of goods and souvenirs.

<p>
For some reason the monument was put in a cage. So as not to be dragged away?
<p/>

Outside the waterfront with the Hindu temple in Kanyakumari there are many Catholic churches of different shapes and sizes.

<p>
Before leaving, I had lunch at the most budget-friendly place. It looks like this. There is no menu, they just give you rice and three types of gravy, one of which is quite spicy. There are no utensils in this establishment; everyone eats with their hands. At the same time, it’s not particularly cheap - 60 rupees ($1), for about the same money you can eat tastier food in Southeast Asian countries.
<p/>

<h2>Madurai</h2>
<p>
I remember as a child I often read through a book about world landmarks, and there were photographs of an Indian temple that looked like a pyramid, filled to the top with multi-colored statues of gods. And here I am in the city of Madurai at the gates of the Meenakshi Aman Temple.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256402041_0d59b435de_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The case when in reality it looks no worse than in the photographs. Although in the southern part of India most of the temples are similar in shape, but this one is much larger than the rest.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257148244_f40a9c23e3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At night it looks mysterious and a little creepy.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256599638_cb24a0df68_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257443575_2aad140044_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This temple occupies a whole rather large block and has the shape of a square. There are four high towers with statues - one on each side.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256981838_573530d7fd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Tourists are allowed into this temple, with the exception of a few secret rooms, but you cannot take a camera with you. A mobile phone is allowed, and taking photographs with a mobile phone is not prohibited!
<p/>

<p>
So I took some pictures with my phone inside. This is what the courtyard looks like.

<p>
I paid so much attention to the Meenakshi Temple not only because it is cool (which it is), but also because apart from this temple there is absolutely nothing to see or do in the million-strong Madurai. This city looks like all the others, there is not a single beautiful street, there is nowhere to walk, the eateries are the same as everywhere else.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256402006_c0bc7b23c3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A big contrast with China, where in every no-name city like <a href="../chongqing">Guiyang</a> I can remember many interesting places.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257443540_bfe24dabce_h.jpg"/>
<p>
All I took away from walking around Madurai outside the temple was an advertisement on how to shit properly.

<h2>Tiruchirappalli</h2>
<p>
I stopped overnight at Tiruchirappalli on my way to Pondicherry. I didn’t expect anything interesting from the city, but it pleasantly surprised me.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256373289_9ce1fba513_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the middle of the city lies a huge stone, on top of which a temple is built.
<p/>

<p>
First you need to go up the stairs.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254894937_7e8aea1171_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are small temples on each flight.
<p/>

<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255829538_871b55eb6c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Then you get to the top.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256373329_d14f3f4d09_h.jpg"/>
<p>
From here you can see a panorama of the city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254895097_efebb67474_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In principle, nothing special - low-rise buildings on the plain, but observation decks are not that common in India.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255624481_5921d3f2ec_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And you can walk the last piece to the top of the stone.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256373459_dfa359f79e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also a small temple and views from the windows.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255829613_b3c1cfcea4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The stone can be seen from afar.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255829803_4181011378_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also a large Gothic cathedral in the center of Tiruchirappalli.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254894762_44b75bb4fd_h.jpg"/>

At the foot of the stone there are even quite nice streets with colorful houses. The city definitely has potential.

<h2>Pondicherry</h2>
<p>
Not only Portugal, but also France had their own piece of India, and it was also scattered throughout the country. Now these four cities (Pondicherry, Karaikal, Yanaon and Mahe) are a single union territory of Pondicherry (or Puducherry).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256654456_d4f0f1aaa3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Pondicherry has been French for almost as long as Goa - until the 1950s. There are traces of colonization here, although for some reason there are fewer of them than in the Portuguese colonies: these are mainly churches and monuments. The churches here are like that, there is something in common with Vietnam and New Orleans.

It seems that the French were much less successful in converting to Christianity than the Portuguese. There are many more Hindu temples here than churches.

This small city was the capital of the region 1,200 years ago; several monuments included in the World Heritage List have been preserved since then.

The most famous is this temple by the sea, it is called “Coastal Temple”. There is information that 6 more similar ones nearby have now fallen below sea level. It costs 500 rupees to approach the temple, so I looked over the fence.

<h2>Chennai</h2>
<p>
Chennai (formerly Madras) is the largest city in southern India. Travelers rarely stay here for long. I allocated two days to explore this metropolis, in principle, as in most cities in India, this is more or less enough.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257053650_130de91292_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Since Madras was an important colonial port, pompous Victorian-style buildings remain, but fewer than in Mumbai and Calcutta. First of all, this is the railway station:
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255280032_ab15b36e2a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Several buildings on the station square:

<p>
And the courthouse is a huge building, occupying an entire block, however, you can only see the main facade, there are fences on all other sides.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255280207_8b8d86ef55_h.jpg"/>

Riding through the city by train, I noticed a huge Victorian building from the window; I could easily find the place on satellite maps, but it didn’t indicate what it was. For fun, I returned to this train station a couple of hours later and went to find out what it was.
<p/>

Let's get back to the sights. Who would have thought that Chennai houses one of the most important Christian shrines: the relics of St. Thomas the Apostle. Besides Thomas, the relics of only two apostles are known: St. Peter (in the Vatican Cathedral of St. Peter) and St. James (city of Santiago de Compostela, Spain). It seems like the Apostle Thomas went to preach to the east and reached India. This is the place:
<p/>

<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256010331_35ad573bf2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
More precisely, the relics are stored in the basement of a neighboring building (photography is not allowed in the hall itself).
<p/>

<p>
Also in Chennai, of course, there are a number of Hindu temples of varying degrees of interest.

I bought a refreshing drink from a stall - freshly squeezed lemon juice, diluted with water and sugar and shaken. Very tasty, during my time in India I became addicted to this drink. If there is no juice stall nearby (and they are still very common, more often than restaurants), you can buy Limca soda with a similar taste.

I traveled around Madras mainly by city trains. The system is similar to Mumbai - they go very often, they never checked my tickets either. It seems that travel around the city costs 5-10 rupees, I have never paid more.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256210833_e830d858c3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Many train stations look like abandoned buildings. When I first arrived at the station closest to my hotel (and it’s not far from the center), at first I didn’t believe that I was in the right place: there wasn’t a soul around. But the cash register still worked.

<p>
In addition to trains, Chennai has a new metro. At that time, it was the most pointless metro in the world: the line went from nowhere to nowhere, carried air, and was also organized crookedly: although there seemed to be one line, some of the trains did not go to the final station! Everyone was kicked out three stations before the end, and we had to get on another train, which was on the other side of the platform (where the train in the opposite direction should be). In the near future, it is planned to complete the metro so that it runs from the airport to the city center to the railway station.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256211263_1af0ad9319_h.jpg"/>

The reserve for the future is clearly large: so many turnstiles for the sake of the only passenger at the station (me).
