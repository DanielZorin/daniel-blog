<h1>USA: Miami</h1>
<i>19-21 November 2016</i>
<h2>Miami Beach</h2>
<p>
Miami sounds so pretentious. The only place cooler than Miami is the ski resort of Courchevel. When I, like the poor man I am, got off the bus, on which I had been traveling for almost two hours through traffic jams from the airport, for the first half hour I felt like a stranger at this festival of life. Having checked into a hostel for $20 right in the center of the main resort promenade, Ocean drive, I went for a walk. And I quickly realized that there was nothing particularly cool here, this is an ordinary resort where ordinary Americans with an average income vacation. Somewhere far away on the outskirts of the city there are villas of movie stars, which you can see if you buy a boat excursion for a couple of tens of dollars. Otherwise, there is no more pathos here than in Sochi. By US standards, it is even a relatively inexpensive city.

<p>
The most noticeable thing about Miami Beach is the large number of show-off convertible cars.

<p>
But if you look more closely, you will notice that the main purpose of these cars is to take selfies next to them, like with tame monkeys.

The beach is not particularly remarkable. Big, sandy.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256637628_09b5d5ff89_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But since this beach is located in a city of millions, you shouldn’t expect heavenly views here. For a city it is very clean and tidy.

<p>
There are restaurants on the first line from the beach, shops on the second, then mostly residential areas.

In Miami, McDonald's rules, not Burger King. Two double cheeseburgers cost three and a half dollars - cheaper than in Russia.

This is who is definitely a stranger at the festival of life.

Fruit market. Even dragonfruit is sold.

<p>
The quality of roads in Miami Beach, oddly enough, leaves much to be desired.

Besides the beach, Miami Beach is famous for having the largest selection of Art Deco buildings in the world.

<h2>Miami</h2>
<p>
Miami Beach and Miami should not be confused; they are two different cities. Miami is on the mainland, and Miami Beach is a long, narrow island separated from the mainland by a strait. Miami has an airport, train station, offices and shopping centers.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257185954_cb7c380e1c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are many small islands between Miami and Miami Beach. Some of them are semi-closed, businessmen and movie stars live there; on such an island you can only see the road and high fences along it. It's quite a long walk to the center of Miami, 5-6 kilometers. There are several bridges connecting Miami Beach to the mainland.
<p/>

<p>
The islands along the route where I walked are not so VIP. There are smaller houses there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256438291_6476d269c8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And the fences are not particularly high.
<p/>

<p>
But everyone still has a swimming pool in their yard and a boat dock.

It is advised not to leave standing water, this is to prevent mosquitoes that spread dengue fever from breeding.

Miami has two metro lines and in the center there is an unusual transport - cars that ride on wheels along an overpass. It's called people mover. Such systems can usually be found at airports or amusement parks, but here it serves the business center of the city, where almost everyone drives a car.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255709942_406fc7fdeb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Travel on this transport is free, so you can go around the entire center of Miami in a circle.
<p/>

<p>
Sometimes the paths go right inside buildings.

One of the stations is located on a hill, from where you can see the panorama of the city.

Miami is similar to other American cities in that it also has several formal buildings built before the Great Depression and many modern skyscrapers.
