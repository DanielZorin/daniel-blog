<h1>Antigua and Barbuda</h1>
<i>8-11 May 2022</i>
<p>
Antigua and Barbuda is a country in the Caribbean consisting of two islands. They are quite far from each other, so I didn’t go to Barbuda because I didn't want to get seasickness. Especially since there is nothing special to see in Barbuda - there is only one village, and it was destroyed a couple of years ago by a hurricane.

Approaching Antigua, the sea is shallow and blue.

Apparently, this is an area with large hotels on the shore, and behind them apartments are sold for citizenship by investment (Antigua and Barduda have the cheapest citizenship of the Caribbean countries)

Antigua has no volcanoes and is generally quite flat, with the highest hills on the island.

The tower in the center is a sugar cane mill. As sugar cane was historically grown on most of the islands, they are found everywhere.

The airport in Antigua is quite large and modern, probably the largest of all independent countries in the Caribbean, after Barbados.

I had a lot of time in Antigua and my flights departed and arrived during the day, so I was not tied to the airport and the capital, and rented a studio apartment in a village in the very center of the island which was relatively cheap ($50 per day).

There is a hospital nearby where you can get an antigen test for coronavirus for "just" $100 (in Europe it would cost less than a euro; in Germany at one time people did them almost every morning before work).

At the opposite end of the island from St. John's, in the town of English Harbor, there is a World Heritage Site - a shipyard named after Admiral Nelson, who lived there for several years.

Now there are all sorts of restaurants and shops in the shipyard premises.

The neighboring island of Montserrat, a British possession, is visible on the horizon. In 1995, a volcano awakened there and covered half of the island with lava, including the main city, and most of the population left. Now planes fly there almost exclusively from Antigua, and the entrance to the territory of the former capital is officially closed, so you need to rent a plane or somehow get through illegally.
