<h1>Thailand: Mae Sot, Kamphaeng Phet, Nakhon Sawan, Surat Thani, Koh Samui, Koh Phangan, Nakhon Si Thammarat, Phatthalung, Hat Yai, Songkhla, Narathiwat</h1>
<i>12 February - 11 March 2016</i>
<h2>Mae Sot</h2>
<p>
A city on the border with Myanmar. I spent the night here twice: on the way there and back. The first time there was a funny pink hotel, where in the corridor there were chairs from buses.
<p/>

<p>
The second time there was a very cozy room, respect to the hotel owners.
<p/>

<p>
The city is like a city, much cleaner than Myanmar.

<h2>Kamphaeng Phet</h2>
<p>
The ancient city of Kamphaeng Phet is included in the UNESCO list along with the more famous Sukhothai.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256443083_a88315d713_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The main group of ruins is long and narrow, you can walk along the low fence and see everything without buying an entrance ticket.

Looks like Sukhothai, yes.

The large area is surrounded by a wall; there are no residential areas inside, but there are wide roads.

<p>
There is a whole forest here, with all sorts of ruins scattered throughout. You can walk off the main road through the village for free.

The ruins are littered with dry yellow leaves, just like golden autumn.

The city of Kamphaeng Phet is located near a huge river. The bus station is at the end of the world behind a two-kilometer bridge.

<h2>Nakhon Sawan</h2>
<p>
A medium-sized city on the way from Bangkok to the north. Here I switched from inexpensive buses to almost free trains on the way from Myanmar, fortunately there is a railway station in Nakhon Sawan.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256726868_825c2f6f3b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It is unusual that the bus station is located in the city center, and there is a highway right next to it, and the railway is far on the outskirts.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257567795_97c25d5c09_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the center of the city there is a lake with a park and an island.

<h2>Surat Thani</h2>
<p>
A transit city where they like to trick white tourists into buying expensive transport. However, I didn't have any problems. I arrived by train, walked to the station, bought a bus + ferry ticket to Koh Samui. You don't need to give in to the touts at the station, and you don't need to come here on a tourist bus. On the way back I went south to Nakhon Si Thammarat, there are no scams in this direction. They say that if you go from Koh Samui towards Bangkok or Phuket via Surat Thani, there is a risk of getting into a minibus that will take you somewhere 10 km from the city center, from where only scam buses and expensive taxis go.

An hour's drive from Surat Thani is the port with ferries to the islands of Koh Samui, Koh Phangan and Koh Tao.
<p/>

<h2>Koh Samui</h2>
<p>
The plan was this: to stay at the ferry terminal on Koh Samui, go to neighboring Phangan for one day at the Full Moon Party, then move to some beach village. But everything went wrong. On the day of FMP, I caught a cold, could hardly wait until the return ferry at 8 am, and then spent three days in bed with a temperature of 40. When I started to recover, Alena fell ill. As a result, we spent 10 days on Koh Samui, and only on the last day we got to the beach, after which I left this island with great pleasure.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256291056_bd55258732_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And it didn't all start out so bad.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256291036_676fe94009_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also a beach in the city near the ferry terminal.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256489853_be3b96a695_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It’s just not very pleasant to be there - everything is clogged with small crustaceans, and the water level is ankle-deep.
<p/>

<p>
Being tied to the hotel, I walked around all the surrounding streets 500 times. There's nothing interesting there, just a sign.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257038224_4f2534ff79_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It glows like crazy.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255560727_af71fef6b7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A few days later it became more fun - a night market opened nearby.
<p/>

<p>
They gave concerts.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255560917_f5d009f626_h.jpg"/>
<p>
They sold furniture.
<p/>

<p>
I didn’t feast on beetles.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256291291_6c613c6d8e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But I tried horseshoe crabs. A peculiar thing.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256291376_91324d15ad_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Noodles are ok, 40-50 baht. Sushi for 6 baht was sold, but not every day.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256291186_93bddebb7d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
My favorite is this fried meat with a very tasty sauce.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255561377_f71389d0b3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Finally the day came to see the island. Everything is very bad with public transport, there is virtually none, especially in the late afternoon. A taxi is very expensive: for 10 kilometers they charge $20 (for comparison, in Bangkok with the meter it will cost no more than $3). You can hitchhike.
<p/>

<p>
This is Maenam Beach, which was the main one 10 years ago, but has now lost the palm to Chaweng on the eastern side of the island.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255560987_a4208b6fff_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is no beach, the water is muddy.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256291501_50c49e02f5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There aren't too many people either.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255561077_6a260df3d9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And this is Chaweng beach. It’s also not worth going that far. It's no worse in Pattaya.

<p>
Prices on Samui are something.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256291831_819d5e567b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Forty should be a kilo of pineapples, not four small pieces.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257333070_dcb6ac2d61_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A Big Mac on Samui costs more than 200 baht. I've only seen more expensive ones in Switzerland.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257332900_40342412f9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Sushi is also far from 5 baht.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257038564_72075f0baa_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Somehow everything is completely sad and hopeless.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256291641_482995bebb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I will never go to Koh Samui again.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256490333_b39dd72be3_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Koh Phangan</h2>
<p>
Koh Phangan is another Thai resort island. There is an even smaller share of the local population here, it is a little more expensive than on Koh Samui, it takes longer to get here and the ferry is somehow disproportionately expensive: 300 baht one way (for comparison, from the mainland to Koh Samui it costs 120, despite the fact that the trip is three times longer). There's nothing to do here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256290001_347e6fbc44_h.jpg"/>
<p>
"Pay before the worm." 7-11 percent is 20% more expensive than on the mainland.

<p>
It seems strange to me to travel such a distance for such a terrible beach.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256290291_765c93c3d4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At low tide it is generally impossible to swim; the water is ankle-deep for tens of meters in the distance.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256489178_c02c61c7e0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At the same time, there are hotels all along the coast, and someone lives here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257331665_68d64bdaf7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In general, there would be no point in going to Koh Phangan if it weren’t for the monthly Full Moon Party.
<p/>

<p>
Every month on the day of the full moon, the Full Moon Party is held on Koh Phangan - probably the largest regular party in Southeast Asia. The event is significant, I went.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257037839_4c8de68b7a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I was worried that there would be no ferry tickets, but you can buy them the day before without any problems, although the regular ferry from Samui runs only three times a day and does not accommodate many people. Apparently, many people don’t bother and buy a special transfer not from the main pier (it’s twice as expensive). The Full Moon Party takes place on Haad Rin Beach in the southeast of Koh Phangan. Already during the day it becomes a bit crowded there.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255560047_af261200d8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The beach is generally a bit small, and there are a lot of hotels around, besides FMP, I wouldn’t stay here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257331725_6ad287bd6f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Two main attributes of FMP. Firstly, fluorescent paints in acid colors.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257331695_070672f3df_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Secondly, buckets. The bucket is a signature cocktail consisting of Thai strong drink Hong Thong or Sang Som, soda and Red bull (the bottle of Red bull in the photo lies at the bottom of the bucket). It’s inexpensive, 200 baht (only a little more expensive than buying all the ingredients at 7-11), it’s very easy to drink through a straw, and, as you might guess, you get drunk very quickly.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256038132_9a4a94cca1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are lighter drinks too.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256290481_1c9ef516ef_h.jpg"/>
<p>
They also sell food, the prices are higher than usual, but I wouldn’t say extortionate. Pad Thai is generally worth it.

Somewhere after midnight, entry to the beach costs 100 baht. The ticket sellers can only be seen at the main entrance. And some are taken by boat directly to the beach. Although the party should generate a very respectable profit every month, the organization is very lame. There is a catastrophic shortage of trash cans and toilets.

I didn't really like the musical component. Maybe the grass was greener when I was 20, but in my opinion the drive was lacking.

By morning, everything around was littered with bottles, and those who could not withstand the pressure slept on benches or sand.

<h2>Nakhon Si Thammarat</h2>
<p>
Nakhon Si Thammarat was once the southern capital of Thailand, which at certain points in history even gained independence. This is probably the only place in the south of Thailand where you can see the ancient ruins that are present in abundance in the north and center of the country.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256728058_f85e44a17d_h.jpg"/>

The main and most ancient temple is this one.
<p/>

Interestingly, the city was originally built near the seashore, but now the sea has retreated, and there is now dry land 20 kilometers to the east. Therefore, the city is stretched from north to south, and narrow from west to east, although it would seem there is room there.

<h2>Phatthalung</h2>

In the south of Thailand and Malaysia, you can find karst landscapes almost in an open field, although not in such concentration as in Yangshuo and Halong Bay.

Songkhla is a resort where only Thais and Malays go. You won't find tourists from Europe here. In some way this city subtly reminds me of Anapa.

<h2>Narathiwat</h2>
<p>
The provinces of Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat in the south of Thailand are for some reason considered dangerous territory. On the official websites of the Foreign Ministries of various Western countries, the threat level is not even orange, but red - like in Syria or Somalia. Before that, I had been to a similar place once - in the Caucasus. In the south of Thailand there are predominantly Muslim Malays who would like to secede. Terrorist attacks occur approximately every week, but what if you read the news more closely? “In village X, a terrorist attacked a policeman with a knife,” “In village Y, terrorists burned down a school.” Over the past 10 years there has not been a single major incident; all terrorist attacks are directed against the army, police or schools (as places where the damned occupiers force you to learn the Thai language). In addition, almost all attacks occur in rural areas, because in cities there are simply more police, checkpoints, and it is more difficult to organize a terrorist attack. So don’t listen to the warnings and feel free to travel around the region.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256734018_8bf01f7545_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In general, Narathiwat is not rich in attractions, but it has its own atmosphere.
