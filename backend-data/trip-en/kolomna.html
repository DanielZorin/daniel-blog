<h1>Russia: Kolomna</h1>
<i>12 June 2012</i>
<h2>Kolomna</h2>
<p>
It takes two hours to get to Kolomna by train from Moscow. This is probably far enough that a significant part of the population does not go to work in Moscow, but at the same time close enough for foreign tourists to come here for one day. The courtyards have a cozy provincial look.

<p>
There are old inscriptions on the doors.

<p>
And the street names are funny in English. I wonder if this helps foreigners at all? It’s not difficult to learn the Cyrillic alphabet or compare the letters by sight; these are not hieroglyphs.

Modern trams with electronic displays travel around Kolomna, there are ticket machines on the streets, and travel costs an exorbitant by provincial standards 23 rubles.
Also in Kolomna there are flat traffic lights, like in Minsk.

The feeling of deja vu with Minsk intensifies: the same inscription “Supermarket” and a poster about the cleanliness of the city on half the wall.

But in reality, in terms of cleanliness, this is not Belarus at all.

Although the level of embezzlement here is probably lower than in Moscow. In any case, they built a children's playground here that I have never seen anywhere in Moscow.

And commieblocks began to be painted in bright colors, like in Bratislava.

And the supermarket also has a special queue management service. I was already imagining how I would become as famous as Navalny, forcing cashiers to sit in all available cash registers, but local residents disappointed me by telling me that this phone usually does not answer.

The center is, of course, very beautiful. There are almost no foreign structures in the historical part. It’s just that someone thought of building a stadium near the Kremlin.

<p>
In honor of the city anniversary, for which I was one day late, the center was decorated with flags and old photographs, from which it can be concluded that almost nothing in the center has been destroyed in a hundred years.

In the village of Staroye Bobrenevo, located on the opposite bank of the Moscow River from Kolomna, I discovered a very beautiful monastery. Although the monastery seems to be working, the entrance to it is not visible.

Half a truck is parked next to him.

<p>
The water in the taps in Old Bobrenevo tastes similar to the water that Schweik gave to Second Lieutenant Dub to drink somewhere in the vastness of Hungary.
It also seems that there are spies in Kolomna who communicate with each other through inscriptions on the asphalt.
