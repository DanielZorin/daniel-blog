<h1>China: Chengdu, Leshan, Chongqing</h1>

<h2>Chengdu</h2>
<p>
Everyone comes to Chengdu to see giant pandas who live in the wild only in Sichuan province. On the outskirts of Chengdu there is a nursery where they are bred. More than 100 pandas live there. Of all the places I've been in China, this reserve has the highest concentration of foreigners.

Pandas are very cute. To see them awake, you need to arrive early in the morning.

In addition to giant pandas, there are also small pandas. Initially, they were called “pandas” until Europeans knew about the existence of giant ones. In English they are called "Red panda" or "Firefox", the famous browser was named after this animal.

There are a hell of a lot of fish living in the ponds; if you throw some bread, they will cause a real massacre.

Lunch for two for ~$15. In fact, two dishes were ordered - steak (top right) and Sichuan hotpot (center) - a local dish served very hot right with hot coals and a hell of a lot of pepper. They served four more plates of appetizers and a couple of desserts.

But the main party place is the people's park. This is a park with rides, a disco and benches where you can play board games.

From the park I went to the local tech market and bought a new laptop, spending the rest of the evening setting it up.

<h2>Leshan</h2>
<p>
It takes about two hours to drive from Leshan to Chengdu. There is a huge (70 meters) Buddha statue carved into the rock.

There is a huge crowd on the descent to the feet of Buddha, so it is best to arrive at closing time, when it clears up.

The last bus back leaves at 7 pm, we were late for it, but there were taxi drivers hanging out near the station who promised to deliver to Chengdu for a price only 20 percent higher than the price of the bus. We took a taxi to some exit from the city, where we could catch a passing bus to Chengdu. Some had to ride a little in the trunk.

<h2>Chongqing</h2>
<p>
Many people are probably wondering - why travel to all sorts of cities? Everyone has already traveled before us, you can read about everything in Wikipedia, guidebooks and blogs. I guess I'll answer this way. As long as the intense pleasure from visiting a great place, about which no one has ever said anything good, will cover the boredom of monotonous residential areas and old cities with narrow streets, I will go and look at everything myself, without relying on the opinions of others. This was the case in <a href="../smolensk">Bryansk</a>, this was the case in <a href="../poland">Gdansk</a>, this was the case in Chongqing. It is written everywhere about Chongqing that it is a gloomy industrial city, and there is nothing to see there. My biggest mistake while traveling in China was that I allocated too little time to this city.
<p/>

<p>
I traveled to Chongqing from Chengdu in a vestibule - after being late for the train I had to take the remaining tickets for the next one. In Chinese vestibules they give you buckets to sit on. It takes two hours to get to Chongqing by high-speed train. Chongqing used to be part of Sichuan Province, but is now a city region like Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. Chongqing's population is about 30 million, making it a serious contender for the title of the largest city in the world. From 1937 to 1945 Chongqing was the capital of China, and for this reason it was thoroughly bombed by the Japanese.

<p>
From all this it is difficult to understand what this city is like, so we need to find out in practice. The next day, early in the morning, I had a flight to Guangzhou, so I chose a hotel on the outskirts of the city, near the airport. The hotel for 1000 rubles ($30) is, as always, divine. In my opinion, it is better to live in such a hotel than for the same money in a one-room apartment on the outskirts of Moscow.

The proximity to the airport is actually imaginary, it’s only close on the map, but in reality it’s very inconvenient to walk there.

You need to cross the highway because there is no pedestrian crossing. It’s better not to get to the airport, but to get off at the penultimate metro station, then you won’t have to cross the highway.
