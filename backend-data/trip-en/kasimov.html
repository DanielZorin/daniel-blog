<h1>Russia: Yegoryevsk, Dmitrovsky Pogost, Spas-Klepiki, Kasimov, Old Ryazan, Ryazan, Lukhovitsy</h1>
<i>22-23 August 2020</i>
<h2>Yegoryevsk</h2>
<p>
Yegoryevsk is one of the cities in the Moscow region remote from the Moscow Ring Road, it’s like <a href="../krasnogorsk">Serpukhov</a> or <a href="../zaraisk">Zaraisk</a>: not a residential suburb, but a separate self-sufficient city. It is relatively difficult to get to Yegoryevsk, since there is no direct train to Moscow, so you need to travel by road, and this is always long and painful. There was a traffic jam on the main highway for many kilometers, so I drove through Kupavna and secondary roads in the Pavlovsky Posad area. In the village of Danilovo, a monument to the one-armed bandit, Lenin, was discovered.

<p>
It turned out that the central street of Yegoryevsk was beautifully landscaped.
<p/>

<p>
The city is small, so all the front buildings are concentrated on it, and there are private homes on parallel streets.

The central square is diamond-shaped, as are the two smaller adjacent squares.

Soviet hotel. From above you can see the funny coat of arms of Yegoryevsk - a hand with a spear sticks out of the cloud and inserts it into the dragon’s mouth.

<h2>Dmitrovsky Pogost</h2>
<p>
Beyond the Yegoryevsk district, the even more mysterious and distant Shatursky begins. The road passed through its southern part, away from the main city, but I stopped at a couple of settlements along the way. The village with the name Zhabki ("little toads") was distinguished by a chic inscription at the entrance.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257104605_d25f73e198_h.jpg"/>

<p>

<p>
The village of Serednikovo. The central square looks sad - there is an abandoned Soviet cultural center and a store there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256808579_b8812ef34b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But otherwise, along the highways there are quite normal-looking houses.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256261308_8de8f1675c_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256808684_c0a6616cdf_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Then I made a short detour to visit the village of Dmitrovsky Pogost (quite large, more than 2000 people).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256060741_599a2de593_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The point is that there is a very rare example of a monument to Lenin here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256808759_9b6401184b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Lenin is sitting here on a bench with two bearded village men.

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256808844_12052a892f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A few kilometers from Dmitrovsky Pogost there is the village of Korobovskaya, after which this entire area was called Korobovskaya volost before the revolution. Now Dmitrovsky Pogost itself is colloquially called Korobovo (apparently, it’s shorter).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255331217_15670d45b0_h.jpg"/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256060986_27cf3eda7d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Dmitrovsky Pogost is named after the graveyard ("pogost") at the Church of Dmitry Solunsky.

<h2>Spas-Klepiki</h2>
<p>
Finally we enter the Ryazan region. The northern part of the Ryazan region, the south of the Vladimir region and the east of the Moscow region make up the historical region of Meshchera, where the national park of the same name is located.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255543001_0c3f05c722_h.jpg"/>

<p>
The road goes mostly through dense forest.

<p>
At the junction of the Moscow and Ryazan regions there is an area with a large number of lakes.

The nearest town is called Spas-Klepiki.

I love Spas-Klepiki. Unusual shape.

<p>
Further along the way was the city of Gus-Zhelezny. Sunset was already approaching, and I didn't plan to stay there long (except because of the name which means "Iron Goose"), but from the highway I saw a colossal cathedral with a bell tower, clearly larger in scale than this village with less than 2,000 inhabitants.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254813847_66d40e3e52_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The shape of the cathedral is more similar to some German or English one, and this is not without reason - this style is called Russian pseudo-Gothic.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255748393_50f77a43d6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are not many examples of this style. The most famous are the Chesme Church in St. Petersburg and the palace in Tsaritsyno.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257581234_90e0dca3b3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The church in Gus-Zhelezny was built in the first half of the 19th century, the architect is not exactly known.

The Gus River, after which the village is named. On the same river stands the more famous city of Gus-Khrustalny ("Crystal Goose", famous for crystalware production).

<h2>Kasimov</h2>
<p>
The main goal of the trip was Kasimov - one of the historical cities of Russia in the north of the Ryazan region. This is one of the most beautiful small towns in Russia with an unusual history: in the mid-15th century, Moscow Prince Vasily II gave this region (and the city, which was then called New Lower City) to Kasim, the son of the Kazan Khan, who helped him in the struggle for the throne. As a result, the Kasimov Khanate appeared in the middle of Muscovite Rus', for a long time remained a formally independent vassal of Moscow, and was fully annexed only at the end of the 17th century.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257001444_2fbd178c7a_h.jpg"/>

<p>
The current Kasimov is, of course, not a city of the 15th century, but rather of the 18th-19th, but with a very extensive and well-preserved historical center.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257295945_7a7cee4a89_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The square is impressive in scale - there are several churches, and two levels of shopping arcades with columns.
<p/>

Opposite it there used to be the main monument to Lenin, but now it is gone. I took advantage of the situation and became a monument myself.

Now the main Lenin stands on Lenin Square, in a fairly quiet residential area near the center.

<p>
The roads in Kasimov are very, very bad. Only some central streets are more or less normal. Since I had a car, I lived in a hotel on the outskirts, and there were such gullies around that I could drive at a maximum of 10-15 km/h. At the same time, roads outside the city are of good quality. As far as I understand, roads in the city are repaired at the expense of the city budget, and outside the cities - at the expense of the regional budget, which is clearly larger even in the not very rich Ryazan region.

There are almost no residential areas on the other side of the river, but a few kilometers from the shore is the Prioksky Non-Ferrous Metals Plant - the place where bullions for Russia's gold reserves are produced.
<p/>

<p>
An interesting page in the history of the city is connected with the plant - in the early 1990s, through cunning machinations, workers stole gold from the plant, and in the city itself the mafia lived in incredible luxury, from time to time killing each other in the struggle for control over the gold trade. You can watch a film about these events from the series “Criminal Russia”.

<h2>Old Ryazan</h2>
<p>
Not everyone knows that the city of Ryazan received its name only at the end of the 18th century, and before that it was called Pereslavl-Ryazansky. Historical Ryazan, the capital of the principality of the same name, was in a different place, 50 kilometers from the modern one. Ancient Ryazan was destroyed during the Mongol invasion in the 13th century, and by the 14th century it was almost completely abandoned. Now near this place there is the village of Staraya Ryazan and a few kilometers away on the other side of the river the city of Spassk.

<p>
First I had to get from Kasimov to the village of Shilovo, then turn onto the Ural highway. These are local roads, but it turned out that they are of quite good quality in the Ryazan region. Shilovo is a fairly large village.

<h2>Lukhovitsy</h2>

I passed through Lukhovitsy in 2011 on the way to <a href="../zaraisk">Zaraysk</a> and saw the main attractions then, but you can get to know the city a little closer. The center is located a few kilometers from the highway, around the station on the Moscow-Ryazan road, thanks to which this village once began to grow and became a city.
