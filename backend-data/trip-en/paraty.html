<h1>Brazil: Ubatuba, Paraty, Vitória</h1>
<i>22-24, 27 May 2021</i>
<h2>Ubatuba</h2>
<p>
Ubatuba is a small resort town on the coast in the state of São Paulo. As on the way to Santos, the road to Ubatuba includes a sharp descent to the seashore.

The end of May is low season, it is a little cool here (although in Russia this would be considered very warm weather), and there are almost no tourists, and even most of the restaurants on the embankment were closed with the promise of opening sometime in October.

<h2>Paraty</h2>
<p>
The World Heritage-listed city of Paraty is located on the coast approximately midway between Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Before the construction of a direct road inland, this was a place to spend the night. During the Portuguese colonization, gold mined in the state of Minas Gerais was brought here. After the end of gold mining, the city lost its significance, and therefore retained its historical appearance.

<p>
This region is called the Green Coast (Costa Verde), the landscapes are similar to Rio de Janeiro.

<p>
Paraty has an interesting feature - the city is close to the sea, and during high tides the streets flood. Therefore, they are specially made so that the sidewalks are raised, in some places there are even bridges, and at first glance it is not clear why they are needed.

Vitória is the capital of the rarely visited state of Espirito Santo. I flew there for one day from Rio de Janeiro purely to see another state.

<p>
As usual, I didn’t bother with public transport, which is not very good in this city, especially when you have to travel far due to the difficult terrain. I immediately took a taxi to the south. In fact, there are two cities here: Vitória and Vila Velha, separated by a narrow bay. As its name suggests, Vila Velha is the original location of the city, founded in 1535 (the third city in Brazil after Salvador and Recife). Later the capital was moved to Vitória (which was called Vila Nova da Vitória). There is almost no old architecture left in Vila Velha, except for a couple of forts and a monastery.
