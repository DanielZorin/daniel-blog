<h2>Andorra</h2>
<p>
Of all the microstates, Andorra takes the longest to get to; from the nearest airports (Barcelona and Toulouse) it takes three hours. Andorra is the twin of <a href="../liechtenstein">Liechtenstein</a>. Both countries are in the mountains, there are no other attractions (unlike Monaco, San Marino or Luxembourg), until recently both were small "islands" outside the Schengen area. However there are way more tourists in Andorra.

The main reason people come to Andorra is for skiing and snowboarding. In Liechtenstein it is much less developed, so 99% go there for half a day, while in Andorra many stay for a long time. I'm not interested in winter sports, so one day was enough for me. Cities in Andorra are attractive mainly because of the natural surroundings.

The capital of Andorra la Vella/Vieja is actually not so Vella, but very much noua/nueva.

I tried to find the "old part of the city" until I realized that it consisted of one street - this one.

Andorra la Vella is side by side with another town called Escaldes-Engordany.

Lots of modern architecture and contemporary art, which also reminds me of Liechtenstein.

In Andorra, like everywhere else in Europe (except France), there is public transport. It is represented by buses. What’s interesting is that in such a small country there are two competing companies, and on the bus of one company they didn’t accept my ticket from the other! The whole country is divided into 4 zones, travel to 1 zone costs 1.30 euros if you buy a ticket for 10 trips. Unfortunately, there is no pass for the whole day (more precisely, there is one only within the first zone). The first place I went to was Encamp, one zone from the capital.

There is some kind of chaos on the balconies with chairs.

The town of Pas de la Casa is located in the highest part of Andorra. Here in the mountains the altitude is more than 3000, there is snow even in the off-season, and the main ski slopes are here. In addition, Pas de la Casa is located on the border with France, so the French come here to shop: since Andorra is not included in the customs space of the European Union, prices seem to be lower. In reality, I didn’t notice much of a difference in prices, apparently because I have no idea how much cigarettes cost in France or anywhere else. Food costs about the same. There is even a customs check at the exit towards France (at the entrance from Spain only passports were checked).

The border between Andorra and France runs along the La Arieja River, if, of course, it can be called a river.

I didn’t even take my passport with me, so I took this photo while illegally staying in France.

There are houses only on one side of the border, and nothing on the other side.

Pas de la Casa can be reached through a pass or through a tunnel under the mountains. What’s interesting is that the exit from the tunnel is already in France, and the bus from there goes back to Andorra.

Ice is a big problem in Pas de la Casa. Having walked along the local hilly streets, I more than once remembered Luzhkov’s cocktail with a kind word.

Let's look a little at Andorra's infrastructure. Here the concentration of Russian tourists has reached a critical point when the shops begin to put signs in Russian.

Throughout Andorra there is a network of perfume shops that made me think every time “What is Google selling here?”

If in <a href="../latvia">Riga</a> and <a href="../washington">Arlington< /a> they put wool on pillars, then in Andorra they put wool on railings.

In Andorra, the markings of parking zones are reviewed every year and stickers are placed on signs.

In general, Andorra is a pleasant place, definitely worth a trip once, to enjoy the mountains and move on in the direction of southern France.
