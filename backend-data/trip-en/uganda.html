<h1>Uganda: Mbarara, Kampala, Jinja</h1>
<i>19-21 July 2024</i>
<h2>Mbarara</h2>
<p>
After the border, I had a long journey to the capital of Uganda, long but comfortable - in a large bus, and even with an empty seat next to me. At first, the landscapes in Uganda are as hilly as in Rwanda, but gradually they taper off.

<p>
It is immediately obvious that it is not so clean here.

A village.

<p>
The houses are quite decent.

We pass a small town.

Here, too, there are flooded fields in the valley.

In East Africa, bulls have some unusually huge horns.

A market. As usual, they sell vegetables lined up in pyramids.
<p/>

<p>
In a tent in the field, they are celebrating some kind of holiday, probably a wedding.

<p>
A truck with bananas. At first I was puzzled why they were so green. It turns out that this is a special type of banana from East Africa. They make a local dish called matooke.
<p/>

In the villages there are structures in the form of a truncated pyramid of unknown purpose.

A door shop.

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945982241_bc644ed26b_o.jpg" >
<p>
They sell food and drinks at the stops. Fried corn is popular all over Africa, but in Uganda, kebabs are especially good.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946441800_abb0fc20ce_o.jpg" >
<p>
They are big and juicy, and cheap.

When it got dark, we passed the equator, there was even a monument near which people take pictures. We moved briskly until we reached Kampala, and then the nightmare began - the last 50 kilometers took more than 3 hours.

<h2>Kampala</h2>
<p>
The capital of Uganda is quite an interesting city, fortunately it is located on picturesque hills, and Lake Victoria is not far away (in the neighboring city of Entebbe). But the main feature is the traffic jams, the whole city is one continuous traffic jam, since for a population of 7 million there is not a single road wider than two lanes. Even taxi apps offer mostly motorcycles, not cars. Cars are only available in Uber, and the price is much higher than usual in Africa. 
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946322619_81693ba76d_o.jpg" >
<p>
Luckily, the bus dropped me off in the very center, I found a hotel in the nearest block, so I didn’t have to go far, I walked and rode longer distances by motorcycle taxi. First - to the independence monument. 
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946322769_010a90b7bf_o.jpg" >
<p>
It’s somehow really quiet and calm here, there are some big offices and government buildings around.

The station for minibuses impressed me the most. These are local minibuses, and a few hundred meters from here there will be another station for long-distance minibuses.

<p>
Someone hung a portrait of Idi Amin on the minibus. He was the president of Uganda from 1971 to 1979, one of the most odious rulers in world history. He did many eccentric things, for example, he wanted to put up a monument to Hitler. They also say that he declared war on the USA, and the next day he declared himself the winner, but I have not found any proof of this story in English-language sources. Of course, he personally shot the dissatisfied, and then ate them. Amin's rule ended with him deciding to attack Tanzania, but something went wrong, and the Tanzanian army occupied Uganda and overthrew him.

In East Africa, you can buy jackfruit, this tree was brought here from Southeast Asia, and it has taken root well.

On another hill to the west of the market area is the "historical center" of Kampala.

Cakes in Africa look very appetizing, a lot of cream. I have never bought one, because I can't handle that much on my own.
<p/>

<p>
A couple of kilometers from the center are the royal tombs - a UNESCO World Heritage Site. I couldn't miss this - there aren't many places like this in Africa.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945084722_8698d7c7ee_o.jpg" >

There are several buildings with unusual round roofs like these.

The main building is this. Four kings of Uganda are buried there, who ruled from 1835 to 1969, the last one was also the first president of independent Uganda.

There are residential buildings around it, where the king's widows and other relatives live, they look after the tombs.
<p/>

View near the entrance to the tombs. There are many hills in Kampala, and it's easy to find such juicy views.
<p/>

<h2>Jinja</h2>
<p>
Uganda borders the northeastern shore of Lake Victoria, the largest lake in Africa (Kenya and Tanzania also border this lake). The two main cities on the coast are Entebbe (a suburb of Kampala) and Jinja, 100 km to the east. Jinja is a pleasant town, even a bit of a resort.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946322934_2f5129d46d_o.jpg" >
<p>
The hotel for $14 (50 thousand shillings) was quite good.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945085167_ddf4441988_o.jpg" >
<p>
The city center, as usual, is a shopping area. What's strange is that it is far from the lake, although one might expect some kind of embankment here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945085197_9429881858_o.jpg" >

On the right you can see the roof of a Hindu temple. In Uganda and Kenya there are still many people of Indian origin, they moved here during colonial times.

<p>
I took a motorcycle taxi and went to the river bank. Jinja is located at the place where the Nile River flows out of Lake Victoria. More precisely, the White Nile, there is also the Blue Nile, which begins in Ethiopia. They merge in Sudan (the capital of Sudan, Khartoum, is there) and the Nile flows through Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea as a single river.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946444140_1ca5755e7a_o.jpg" >
<p>
On the map I saw a road leading across the bridge to the other side.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946322929_93575929b9_o.jpg" >
<p>
As it turned out, the road is quite passable, the locals walked there and rode motorcycles to get to the area on the other side of the river.
<p/>

<p>
This bridge is actually a railway.

<p>
Here it is - the source of the Nile. Lake Victoria is visible in the distance. Strictly speaking, this is not quite the source, because water also flows into the lake from somewhere. It is believed that the real source is in Burundi near Mount Kikizi.
<p/>

<p>
Apart from this place, there is nowhere to really go to the river bank from this side. There is another place where you need to go around, and there seems to be an official observation deck with a paid entrance.
