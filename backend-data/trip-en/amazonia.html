<h1>Brazil: Manaus, Santarém, Belém</h1>
<i>17-23 April 2021</i>
<h2>Manaus</h2>
<p>
The northern part of Brazil is occupied by the Amazon rainforest - a region with exotic animals and plants, where instead of roads there is the Amazon river and its numerous tributaries. In the middle of the Amazon lies the city of Manaus with a population of more than 2 million. Manaus boomed at the end of the 19th century during the rubber rush - the Hevea tree was the only source for rubber production, and it grew only in South America. When Hevea began to be grown in other tropical countries, Manaus became impoverished, and now it is an ordinary city, serving primarily as a hub for a vast region.

I arrived in Manaus on Saturday evening. The coronavirus peaked in Manaus earlier than in the rest of Brazil, and by the end of April there were almost no restrictions. In the evening, street bars and kebab shops were open.

<p>
But the next day was Sunday - a day of silence, when the streets were empty.
<p/>

<p>
Walking around the city was quite uncomfortable, but I spent half a day outside the city on an excursion, so everything turned out quite well.

Many buildings with colorful facades remain from the era of wealth in Manaus.

But already opposite, all the street stalls are boarded up and wrapped in cloth, like statues in St. Petersburg palaces in winter.

<p>
The most popular fish is called "piraruco", you can eat it in a restaurant for 20-25 reais. Cornmeal and cassava (farofa) are traditionally added to rice as a side dish in the Amazon, but this is less common in other regions.

From Manaus I went on a standard excursion to the Amazon and the surrounding area. A tour on a large boat costs about 120 reais, and for 300 I rented a small motor boat with a guide for two right in the port. In terms of time, it was much less than on a large boat, but mostly due to a much higher speed of movement   the absence of stops for lunch, a long time to collect all passengers, etc. In general, I definitely recommend this option if you are not alone.
<p/>

<p>
The journey begins at the port of Manaus.

<p>
The first place is the confluence of waters.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257460220_2370e19bd3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here the Rio Negro River (with dark water) flows into the Amazon (with brown water), but the currents are so strong that 20-30 kilometers of the river flow in parallel, without mixing.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256616433_87ef0d5368_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Interestingly, the two rivers also have different water temperatures, which you can feel with your own hands when the boat makes a small circle near the watershed.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256616453_51c2ad5821_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In Brazil, it is believed that the Amazon begins here, and the part of the river before its confluence is called Solimões. In other countries, on maps, the Amazon begins in the Andes in Peru.

<p>
Village for tourists. In the Amazon, more than in other regions of Brazil, there remains an indigenous population (before colonization, Brazil was sparsely populated, much less populated than the Andes, so the modern population is mostly descendants of settlers). In the depths of the Amazon there are even tribes that have never had contact with the outside world. But in the vicinity of large cities, of course, there are no such people, and local residents work in ordinary jobs or entertain tourists.

Another advantage of a small boat is that you can navigate narrow channels.

The latest entertainment is dolphins. Pink dolphins live in the Amazon. In this place they are attracted by the distribution of food, so they swim close to people.

<h2>Cruise on the Amazon</h2>
<p>
Foreign tourists in Russia love to travel by train to Irkutsk, where the journey takes 4 days. Brazil has its equivalent of this epic trip - a boat trip through the Amazon. The distance, of course, is much shorter, but since ships are much slower than trains, it also turns out to be long and meditative. From Manaus to Belém it takes about 4 days to sail, to Santarem (the largest city along the way) - about 30 hours. Surprisingly, I couldn’t find any reliable information about schedules and prices on the Internet, let alone book one. Everything is done the old fashioned way, go to the port with your feet and ask what’s going on.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257166679_fc0ece2986_h.jpg"/>

<p>
The port of Manaus looks something like this from the inside. As you can see, the ships here are far from being cruise ships.
<p/>

<p>
Instead of a reserved seat, there is a common deck where you can hang a hammock (which you need to buy yourself).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257166179_52636b391c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At night. By the way, there are quite a lot of sockets - extension cords are under the ceiling.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257166304_ecbc252976_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It is forbidden for two people to sleep in the same hammock.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257166439_6c1f9b7e44_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But there is also an analogue of a train coupe - a separate cabin. Travel costs 200 reais per person, cabin costs 400 reais for everyone. The cabin pleasantly surprised me. I modestly expected at least an outlet, and there was even an air conditioner and a refrigerator, like in a hotel.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255689977_14185b0bf4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Our ship had two decks with hammocks   several cabins, the lower deck was occupied mainly by cargo   the engine room.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257462535_9819e16d24_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I heard that in recent years in Russia on trains it has become possible to eat normal food in the restaurant car at a reasonable price. There is no such progress on Amazon yet, so the market fills the empty niche. On the ship itself there is only a stall where they sell drinks, cookies and noodles, which can be poured with boiling water. There seemed to be a dining room on the middle deck, where advertisements promised lunch and dinner, but it did not work. But at stops they sold food everywhere, as used to be the case everywhere in Russia at railway stations. The standard is lunch with chicken, pasta and rice, R$12. In the middle there is a local sweet - cassava macacheira pie.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256419886_c8764cf30f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
We depart from Manaus. The schedule was to leave at 5 pm, so I expected to see the confluence of the rivers again.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255690052_04803ac2ce_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But in fact, we set off an hour and a half late; it took more than an hour to load some napkins from the truck.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256419576_353510f75b_h.jpg"/>

There are also hooks on the stick for packages. For some reason, in Brazil they love to sell chips and circles of cheese.

Sunset over the Amazon. Before midnight we had already arrived in Santarem, which was a surprise to me - instead of the promised 36 hours, we sailed for only 29.

<h2>Santarém</h2>
<p>
The city of Santarém is located in the middle of the Amazon, somewhere between Manaus and Belém. In Portugal there is a city with the same name near Lisbon. Santarém has about 300 thousand people, which seems like a lot, but it turned out to be the only Brazilian city where I couldn’t use Uber due to the lack of cars, but fortunately the alternative app 99 worked. The main attraction of Santarém is Alter do Chão beach.
<p/>

<p>
It takes about 40 minutes by bus to get to Alter do Chão. Formally, this is part of Santarém, but it looks like a village. Most of the roads are dirt.

Berth. It turned out that in April the water level in the river was high, and most of the beach was flooded. Umbrellas barely peek out of the water

We had a great time, and the food was also cheap for the beach - fish or steak with all the snacks was only 25 reais.

Alter beach is not on the Amazon, but on its tributary Tapajos. The confluence of the rivers occurs near the center of Santarém.

Tacacá is a signature Amazonian dish. This is a hot and sour soup with shrimp. To prepare it, you need cassava root extract and jambu, a plant related to Sichuan pepper that grows only in the Amazon.

<h2>Belém</h2>
<p>
Near the mouth of the Amazon stands the city of Belém - the end point of the trans-Amazonian routes. The Amazon is so large that the water at the mouth is fresh even tens of kilometers from the coast, and Belém itself is still a little deeper. I was flying to Manaus with a transfer in Belém, so I saw the Amazon for the first time here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256660634_da058ec4cc_h.jpg"/>

<p>
Around Belém, as in other places in the Amazon, there are endless forests with winding rivers.

If you look closely, you can see houses along the banks, that is, the rivers are like roads here.

Ships are unloading next to the market, and it looks like fish entrails are being dumped there, so the smell there is terrible. But the birds like the urubu (black vulture) love it.

<p>
On the other side is the açaí market - açaí berries are brought here by river and sold in bulk, but this happens at 5 in the morning (like selling tuna at the <a href="../tokyo">market in Tokyo</a>). During the day there is nothing here.
<p/>

<p>
In Belém you can try açaí in its pure form - just crushed berries. Behind the glass you can see how a person is right now preparing this drink and pouring it into bottles. It is stored for only a few hours, so only frozen açaí is exported to other regions. In its pure form it’s not at all like what I’ve tried before - it doesn’t taste sweet, but like some kind of tart herbal mixture.
