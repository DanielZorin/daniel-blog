<h1>South Africa: Rustenburg, Johannesburg, Pretoria, Emalahleni</h1>
<i>6-10, 13-14 February 2023</i>
<h2>Rustenburg</h2>
<p>
From Botswana I entered the northwestern province of South Africa, which is called simply North West. This province mainly speaks the Tswana language, that is, it is like a continuation of Botswana. But the landscapes here are more hilly.

<p>
Initially after the border we drive along a straight road without cities.

A small pass. The sign tells you to shift down into a lower gear.

Here comes the descent.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537310644_6214edfae3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The first town along the way is called Zeerust. Looks impressive for a town with a population of less than 10k. Probably there are so many shops and fast foods because the city is on a large highway.

The cosmetics seller asked if I had coins from Russia as a souvenir, but I only had coins from Botswana.

In the store they trade through glass, like at a bank cash desk.

<p>
After Zeerust we drive along a large highway, a pleasant road.

I successfully took a seat in the minibus in front to the left of the driver, so the trip was comfortable.

<p>
Rustenburg is the largest city in the North West Province. Here I stayed at a hotel. Security measures at the entrance:
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537420499_1eb6fbf076_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But this area doesn’t look scary, it’s a typical one-story suburbia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537100126_f08c473b7e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It is prohibited to bring weapons and drugs into the kindergarten.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537524255_66f7f9b200_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I went into the city center to have a look and get some food.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537284193_af0f81c3ce_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The closer to the center, the less comfortable it is (the walk was only 15-20 minutes).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537524170_fe530242db_h.jpg"/>
<p>
What alarmed me most was that most of the shops had already closed, although it was about 6 pm, and it had not even begun to get dark. I immediately remembered the empty streets in Brazil on weekends.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537524140_31b8cdcf37_h.jpg"/>
<p>
One supermarket was open until 7, I did some shopping and returned to the hotel by taxi, since I didn’t want to join the ranks of smoked Russians (that’s what they call pork sausages in South Africa for some reason).
<p/>

<p>
The next day I rented a car to go to Pilanesberg National Park, 60 km from Rustenburg.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53536219292_a22b726748_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I didn't take many pictures along the way as there wasn't much to see. Neither on the outskirts of Rustenburg, nor along the way, where the villages are mostly somewhere off the road. Perhaps this is a legacy of apartheid, when the territories of the villages were Bantustans, and the road was for white people.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537420329_7985daaf7c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Not far from Pilanesberg there is a city named Sun City. In fact, this is not a city, but a large expensive hotel. This is what the entrance looks like, why there are so many paths is unclear. It costs about $20 to enter the hotel grounds, so I didn't go there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537099641_b075cb37bd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Before getting to the gate, I first turned into the area on the side (Sun Village), where there are all sorts of shops and McDonald's. There was also a service entrance for hotel employees.
<p/>

<p>
Some guy was sitting there on the grass, when I turned around he asked if I could hire him for a job. Alas, I am not a South African businessman.
<p/>

<p>
There is a town in front of Pilanesberg that is not too far from the road. It's called Ledig.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537099591_33b48f6c6f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It looks something like this, similar to the outback of South America.

<h2>Pilanesberg National Park</h2>
<p>
In Africa, of course, I wanted to see the wildlife. Other continents do not have as many large animals as Africa. In the vast majority of countries, you can only go on a safari with a guide in a special open-top jeep, but South Africa stands out here in that there are parks where you can drive independently in a regular car. This way you can spend the night in the city, and not in the park, where it is usually much more expensive. The largest and most famous park is Kruger, but it is far from everything, and Pilanesberg was just along the way. Entry costs only about $8.

Road. At first I drove on asphalt roads, then I got used to it and began to drive further and further onto dirt roads.

<p>
Buffaloes by the river, approximately as indicated on the map. It's not very visible, although I put on a 50 mm lens instead of my usual 18-25. Ideally, you need a longer lens, but I don’t have one.

And here is the elephant himself! It's hard not to notice him.
<p/>

Tourists on a group safari also look at the elephant.

The second elephant approached. I saw a lot of elephants that day, fortunately they are the most noticeable and sleep little.

You cannot get out of your car, except in special fenced areas with gazebos.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537187168_fe387e272b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The landscape of the park is quite hilly; this area is actually an ancient volcano, which is why the park has such a round shape.
<p/>

Having pulled onto the dirt road, I came closer to the zebras.

The elephant drank water, and I waited for him to move away. Elephants are big, and even in the car I drove past them with caution.

There is a restaurant in the middle of the park. Toilets are also found in other places near the gazebos.

Having rested, I moved deeper into the western part of the park along dirt roads. And immediately met rhinoceroses.

In general, such an independent safari is fun and exciting. But there are also disadvantages - steering is very difficult and tiring. By the end I had completely lost my concentration after 7 hours of driving on these slow rough roads.

I wanted to find a lion or leopard, but it didn’t work out. These animals are more nocturnal (especially the leopard), sleeping during the day.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537318959_34adf23a61_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And there are a lot of antelopes.

Towards the evening, when it is not so hot, the animals become more active. On the way back to the exit I saw elephants and baby elephants again.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53536117057_8691b31605_h.jpg"/>

<h2>Johannesburg</h2>
<p>
Johannesburg is the largest city in South Africa, with an extremely dubious reputation. To be more precise, the crime rate there is incredibly high; according to all ratings it will be in the world tops. Although in the latest ranking for the number of murders per capita, it only ranks 34th, and among the cities of South Africa, the seemingly calm Cape Town is in the lead. Durban and Port Elizabeth are also higher. But statistics are one thing, feelings and people’s memory are another. Even if crime is now much lower compared to the 90s and 00s (and this is undoubtedly the case), locals still take the usual enhanced security measures. I, too, was very careful and walked around the city a little, but there was no way I could miss such a large and important city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537041586_3ad1e2ff71_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Johannesburg Airport is the main transport hub for the entire region. Until 2017, when South Africa abolished visas for citizens of Russia, even for a transfer you needed a visa, like in the USA, and this made traveling around southern Africa very problematic, since a South African visa was very hard to get.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537043491_8b70df4785_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Johannesburg from above. It looks decently like America - many private houses, areas for cars.

<p>
But in the distance there is chaotic construction - this is a poor area (township), where blacks lived under apartheid.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537228773_6e697da68d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And in the poor, the buildings are dense. The contrast is clearly visible.

Here is the ideal view: on the right is the piece with high-rise buildings - this is Sandton, the modern business center. On the left is a large gray spot - this is the Alexander district, the most famous township.

In the distance you can see the high-rise buildings of the old center.

<p>
The old center is the historical core of the city, where skyscrapers were built during apartheid until 1994. After the fall of apartheid, the center was populated by former residents of Bantustans due to lawlessness, whites left for the outskirts (much like in the USA, only this all happened much more abruptly), and the center quickly fell into decay. The whites made a new business center in the north in the Sandton area. I checked into a hotel in Sandton. The hotel area is fenced around the perimeter, entry is through a barrier.

Sandton didn't seem dangerous to me. You can also meet white people on the street here.

Johannesburg has Gautrain that connects the city centre, Sandton, the airport and Pretoria. These trains are more expensive than other public transport (especially to the airport it costs more than $10 - a taxi is about the same), but there is a security guard in literally every car.

There are a lot of people here during the day, and I don’t think that on such busy streets there is a significant chance of being robbed. But the atmosphere is tense, you constantly feel some sideways glances, which is not the case in other cities in South Africa. Or maybe I'm just paranoid because of the city's bad reputation?

<h2>Pretoria</h2>
<p>
South Africa officially has three capitals: Cape Town has the parliament, Bloemfontein the supreme court, and Pretoria the office of the president and government. But of course, the office of the president is more important than the court, and besides, Pretoria is very close to the economic capital - Johannesburg. Statistically, Pretoria is not much safer than Johannesburg, but the central areas here still do not have such a bad reputation, so I walked right through the city, albeit carefully.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53536112157_f540845220_h.jpg"/>

The fastest and most convenient way to travel from Johannesburg is by taking the Gautrain. It is not entirely clear where one city ends and another begins.

Thinking about what to do in Pretoria besides discreetly photographing buildings, I decided to go to the zoo to see those animals that I did not come across on safari. The zoo is very close to the city center, about 15 minutes walk from the central square. This is one of the largest and most interesting zoos. There is even a section with fish, like in an aquarium.

<h2>Emalahleni</h2>
<p>
From Eswatini I had to return to Johannesburg before flying home. I decided to drive overland through the province of Mpumalanga. In this province all the most interesting things are located on the eastern edge (Kruger National Park and Blyde Canyon), and the vast area west of Eswatini is mainly industrial and mining. I wanted to break the road so as not to spend the night in Johannesburg, for which the city of Emalahleni was best suited.

The landscapes in this part of South Africa are reminiscent of Europe.

The city of Emalahleni turned out to be a typical South African city of average attractiveness.

Bus station. Often, both in everyday life and on signs, the old name of the city is used - Witbank. By the way, the modern name on some of the signs is written with a capital letter inside: eMalahleni. This is a feature of the spelling of the Zulu language, where e is a prefix denoting the nominative case of a certain gender (there are about 20 “genders” in Zulu).

Witbank is the Afrikaans name. This city is about 45% white, but I didn't see any whites. City center:

I booked a hotel near the center, literally five minutes from that square. There were shady streets with spreading trees, and one-story houses behind fences.

It also turned out that this was a red light district. Near every second house there were girls in lingerie or other revealing outfits.

After this, you look differently at such active advertising of penis enlargement and abortion.
