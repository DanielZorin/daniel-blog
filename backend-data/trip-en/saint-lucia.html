<h1>Saint Lucia</h1>
<i>30 April - 2 May 2022</i>
<p>
Saint Lucia is a country consisting of one island of the same name. The plan was simple - I fly to the main airport in the south of the island, spend the night in a hotel next to the airport, and on the next day I go to the capital (from where I leave the next morning by ferry), along the way visiting Soufriere - a city with famous coastal cliffs. But one serious obstacle arose - that day was Sunday. And Sunday in the Caribbean is a disaster, just like in Brazil and Oceania. Nothing works, transport doesn't work. I don’t know what they’re doing here on Sunday, apparently they’re lying on the sofa. In Europe, offices and some shops are also closed on Sunday, but all entertainment venues and restaurants are open so that people can go to them.

<p>
The room that I rented through the usual airbnb near the airport turned out to be a studio apartment.

<p>
I came to the bus stop to look for something going towards Soufriere. There were actually minibuses, but they all went only to the nearest suburbs within 5 km. Someone said that there was no chance at all to go to Soufriere, someone said that theoretically there are chances, but you need to wait a couple of hours. As a result, after an hour and a half, I despaired and went to another stop, from where buses went straight to Castries (the capital) along a shorter road along the eastern coast of the island.

<p>
In the meantime, I looked at the town of Vieux Fort ("old fort"), the second largest city in the country.
<p/>

Everything is closed and empty.

<p>
On the minibus to Castries, however, I took the best seat, so everything was clearly visible. This is the airport and the rock at the Old Fort.

Suddenly, in the middle of nowhere, a stadium with rusty Olympic rings appeared.

The stone is painted in the colors of the flag of Saint Lucia. The flag has three overlapping triangles on a blue background, but for simplicity you can turn them into stripes.

The warehouse was built with funds from <a href="../taiwan">Taiwan</a>. Saint Lucia is one of the few countries that recognize Taiwan instead of China.

Castries is the capital of Saint Lucia, located near a bay in the north of the island. I stayed in the cheapest hotel (which was not cheap at all and cost about $60) near the center in the hills.
<p/>

<p>
There were some slums under the hill.

Center of Castries. The offices and shops in the city center were mostly closed on weekend, but it was still livelier here than in other cities.

It seems like they should be selling something here, maybe souvenirs for cruise passengers.

Saint Lucia minibus. There was nothing going to Soufriere from the capital, but I still had time, so I went where I could - to the north of the island.

Rodney Bay - as I understand, tourists who come for the beach stay here. There is a shopping center, shopping streets and there were even a few working restaurants (not just KFC).
