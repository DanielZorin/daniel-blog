<h1>Thailand: Pattaya, Chanthaburi, Trat, Koh Chang</h1>
<i>17-29 November 2015</i>
<h2>Pattaya</h2>
<p>
Good guys go to heaven, bad guys go to Pattaya. If you are already 50 years old, then this is good advice.
<p/>

<p>
There are two main categories of tourists in Pattaya. The first is older men who meet Thai (as well as visiting Burmese and Cambodian) girls here for the purpose of relationships of varying degrees of duration. The photo shows them hanging out. If you see a young man or woman of any age, then this is almost certainly a tourist from Russia, because only Russian travel agencies thought of selling tickets to a sex resort in the beach holiday category.
<p/>

<p>
There is also a small third category - those who live here for months. That's reasonable: if you absolutely need to live near the seashore, then in Thailand Pattaya will be the best option for the price. This is essentially a big city with all the benefits of civilization and a beach. Phuket is also well developed, but it is objectively more expensive there, and the other resorts are very small and distant, and also expensive. Those who do not need the beach go to live in cities in the north instead of Pattaya.
<p/>

<p>
Pattaya is quite similar to the Philippine sex resort <a href="../luzon">Angeles</a>, only the scale is larger, and there is no beach in Angeles, so there are no beach tourists. Everything is as usual: the cheapest prostitutes can be found on the long promenade (Beach road), the more expensive ones work in bars, and the most expensive ones work in strip clubs and go-gos.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256624456_7dbff96e4b_o.jpg">
<p>
The offer is truly extensive.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255895917_9d6af16534_o.jpg">
<p>
A typical street with bars looks like this. They run perpendicular to the embankment, crossing the first and second streets, and ending at Buakhao Street (it is between the second and third). From Buakhao to the third and beyond there are mainly hotels or residential buildings. There are themed streets (such as streets with trannies).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255895807_c0701e7fe8_o.jpg">
<p>
Beer in bars is really cheap. Starting from 50 baht - it costs the same in the store.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256624546_7553f7400f_o.jpg">
<p>
But usually 60-70. The clientele is the same as in Angeles.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257667660_365156e360_o.jpg">
<p>
An assortment of stalls, just like on the themed streets of Bangkok.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256825033_df54dda61b_o.jpg">
<p>
The main place is, of course, Walking street.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255895432_f7c2057043_o.jpg">
<p>
Under the influence of the flow of tourists, ordinary entertainment establishments appeared here - where they play music or show Thai boxing.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255895547_5d9d982106_o.jpg">
<p>
Street performances.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257668800_4497dd74e3_o.jpg">
<p>
But there are still more go-go bars.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256625661_1365131c9e_o.jpg">
<p>
Beer, by the way, is somewhat more expensive.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256625586_4f67350ac7_o.jpg">
<p>
Go-go bars turned out to be a huge disappointment. In the middle of the hall, five girls stand near poles and languidly jerk their legs from time to time. Grandfathers are sitting along the walls with girls who have already been taken off. That's all.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257667100_7dfa8313f9_o.jpg">
<p>
Only the signs are bright, the inside is zilch.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257667100_7dfa8313f9_o.jpg">
<p>
The only place I found where they actually dance is a Russian bar. By the way, it’s three times more expensive than any Thai one. I'm proud of Russia!
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255895492_19d237aebd_o.jpg">
<p>
With the current exchange rate of the ruble in Pattaya it is no cheaper than in Russia, there are fewer Russians, Russian cafes are closing. The signs still remain.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256824998_c7a20db9a9_o.jpg">
<p>
The main requirement for food.
<p/>

<p>
But it doesn’t matter, a replacement has already been found. Now the Chinese are coming to Pattaya! This is some kind of surrealism: Chinese groups with flags go on a tour along Walking street.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256825258_35534b8f58_o.jpg">

"Note to the right, this is the legendary bar with Russian strippers."
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257370884_123b899035_o.jpg">
<p>
"Here you can buy branded Thai souvenirs."
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257667190_fe79b5d3d9_o.jpg">
<p>
“And this is my colleague, you can buy tickets to the ping-pong show from him!” (The paper describing the ping-pong show, however, is funny translated into Russian)
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257668695_902e788cc7_o.jpg">
<p>
Even more surreal is that above the entrance to Walking Street hangs a portrait of the king and the inscription “God Save the King.”
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257370919_398e1d1157_o.jpg">

And in the tobacco store I finally found Lenin to take a photo with him.
<p/>

<p>
What does Pattaya have besides nightlife? Beach. Well, in principle, the beach is normal, no worse than Sochi, but I wouldn’t go to the other end of the planet for something like this.

The food is ok, the prices are normal. My favorite place an Buakhao Street.

In Pattaya I witnessed one of the main Thai holidays - Loy Krathong.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257668370_bed86271f5_o.jpg">
<p>
The point is to launch a krathong boat into a river or sea, thereby symbolically letting go of negative emotions.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257371964_777d2da45c_o.jpg">
<p>
Krathongs are made from leaves, flowers, bread and rice so that they do not clog the water for a long time.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256625226_26d59038a3_o.jpg">
<p>
In the evening, at low tide, a fleet of krathongs can be seen.

<h2>Koh Laan</h2>
<p>
Those who don't like Pattaya beach go to the neighboring island of Koh Laan (or Larn). The ferry costs 30 baht one way, but many do not want to wait an hour before departure and rent a boat for much more.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257371464_828ee53ed5_o.jpg">
<p>
Laan Island is small, there is a town near the ferry terminal and a couple of roads to the beaches in the southern and eastern parts.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257667860_0468336b80_o.jpg">
<p>
There is a Thai temple here too.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256078977_2911e89da0_o.jpg">
<p>
At the entrance there are figures of soldiers with machine guns.
<p/>

<p>
This is Tawan Beach. There is not a single large hotel on it, but it is still very crowded.

Most Chinese do not know how to swim; on the beach they only take pictures with life preservers.

The Indians will soon replace the Chinese, who are already gradually learning to travel independently, just as the Russians have already learned.
<p/>

<p>
The day is coming to an end, the Thais are relaxing in beach huts.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257668295_77017df500_o.jpg">
<p>
There is a nice looking beach at the northern end of the island. To get here, you need to immediately turn right from the ferry terminal.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256826393_38819886f6_o.jpg">
<p>
And in the northeast it is even better, although there is no road indicated on the map - perhaps you can only get here by water. And maybe during the day there are also a lot of people here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257668330_abd3bb9ab7_o.jpg">
<p>
Koh Laan is a good island to be “in nature” after the densely built-up Pattaya, although if you just need to swim, then in my opinion the Pattaya city beach is not much worse.
<p/>
<h2>Chanthaburi</h2>
<p>
As usual, in a transfer city you need to go eat at a local cafe. Chanthaburi turned out to be quite an interesting city besides food.
<p/>

<h2>Trat</h2>
<p>
Trat is the last large coastal city before the border with Cambodia (although the crossing still takes more than an hour along a narrow strip of Thai territory off the coast) and a transit point for trips to the islands of Chang, Kut and Mak. I was hanging out in Trat for an extra unplanned day, so to have fun I visited absolutely all the local temples and monuments.

On the main square they sell tangerines from their cars, just like they sell potatoes in Russia. 3 kilograms for 100 baht ($1/kilo).

There is an evening market, the food there is good, but there is no sushi, but there are plenty of other snacks.

In general, there is not much to see in Trat, but as in any Thai city, you can have a pleasant and cultural time here.

<h2>Koh Chang</h2>
<p>
I went to Koh Chang Island one day from Trat before crossing the border into Cambodia with the goal of lying on the beach. Koh Chang is a large and mountainous island with civilization only along the shore.
<p/>

<p>
The ferry arrives on the east coast, and all the beaches are on the west. Minibuses on this island (as on the rest of the Thai islands) are not cheap and essentially operate like taxis, and not as regular public transport.

The main place is called White Sand Beach.

There is almost no space on the beach, the strip of sand is terribly narrow.

The beach is normal, the water is clean, but I wouldn’t hang out here for a long time.

The food is ok; in the evening they sell pancakes, pad thai and other classic dishes along the road.

We hitchhiked back to the port, fortunately there is only one road and there is decent traffic. Hitchhiking on the islands of Thailand is good.
