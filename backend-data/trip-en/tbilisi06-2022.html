<h1>Georgia: Tbilisi</h1>
<i>12-22 June 2022</i>
<h2>Tbilisi</h2>
<p>
Although Georgia is an absolutely beautiful country, I have only been to it once <a href="http://goo.gl/UKAueT">eight years ago</a>. This year has given many people a reason to visit Georgia for one reason or another.
<p/>

<p>
Georgia is among the top 10 countries in the world for ease of doing business. For public services, in the very center of Tbilisi there is such a fashionable building - the "House of Justice".
<p/>

The inside also looks nice.

To the left of the entrance there are people who help you quickly get through the line and get a legal address (it’s strange that this relic of the Soviet Union is left here).

In eight years, Tbilisi has changed a lot, the city has become even more modern and advanced.

The two main grocery chains in Georgia are now Carrefour and Spar, direct competition from France and Germany.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52208514522_f06df23012_o.jpg">
<p>
There is also a more elite Goodwill, but it’s basically the same as in Carrefour.

<p>
At the same time, many goods are of Russian or Ukrainian origin, sometimes they are directly adjacent.

An unusual feature of Georgian supermarkets is that here you can buy pasta, flour, and sugar by weight from aquariums like these.

Once, out of curiosity, I went to a Turkish restaurant, everything was authentic - adana kebab.
<p/>

<p>
Prices are slightly higher than in Turkey (16 lari = 5.5 dollars, in Turkey this costs about 55-70 liras = 4.5 dollars). Georgia in general, I would say, is somewhat more expensive than Turkey.

In Georgia, a lot of things are done right on the street. For example, car rental.

In Georgia, it seems, there is no need to certify the technical condition of the car, at least I have repeatedly seen cars with very severe damage driving down the street as if nothing had happened.

In the spring of 2022, drawings of such a cat began to appear everywhere in Tbilisi. There has even been a theory that Russian agents mark missile targets and the location of bomb shelters this way. It turned out that it was just the bartender who spent the night drawing his cat named Shisha (hence the inscription on the side). The court fined him 10 thousand lari and banned him from painting on Georgian territory.

In mid-June, the European Union gave candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova, but refused to Georgia. Because of this, there were several protests in Tbilisi; I attended the largest one.

I decided to explore Tbilisi thoroughly district by district, like other large and important cities in the world. Tbilisi historically has 10 districts, some of which are now formally united into one. On the western bank of the Kura: Mtatsminda (old town), Krtsanisi (south of the old town) and Vake-Saburtalo (northwest of the old town). On the eastern bank: Didube-Chugureti (most of the coast opposite the center, railway station, bus station), Gldani-Nadzaladevi (northern Soviet housing), Isani-Samgori (historical Avlabari district   south-eastern Soviet housing). Tourists usually hang out in the Mtatsminda area.

The most ancient part of the city is Narikala Castle on the hill and the adjacent streets below. The castle is not very high, it is quite easy to climb on foot, but you can also take the cable car, which starts from Rike Park on the other side of the river.

From Freedom Square starts the Rustaveli Avenue - it seems to be the main street, but it is very inconvenient. There is not a single ground crossing along the entire avenue, only underground ones, and those are a kilometer apart, so getting to the other side can be difficult.

Not far from the Gldani massif there is the monument “Chronicle of Georgia” by Zurab Tsereteli.

The monument apparently refers to the giant statues of the pharaohs in ancient Egypt.

This is also an observation deck from which you can see the northern outskirts of Tbilisi (the center is a bit far away).

On the other side of the monument is the Tbilisi reservoir. On the shore you can see the beach where people swim in the summer.

The trailer still hangs over the garages, although the road has not been operated for probably 30 years.

In total, there were or are at least 7 cable cars in Tbilisi: two operating ones (the modern one to the Narikala fortress and the old one to Turtle Lake), Samgori, a closed one to Mtatsminda (from which the station at the Rustaveli metro station remains). There was also a road in the Technological University metro area across the river, it was closed after the opening of the second metro line. And also two cable cars in Saburtalo: to Lake Lisi and between the university buildings - the first was abandoned, and the second, as it turned out, had recently been restored, but I did not have time to explore it.
