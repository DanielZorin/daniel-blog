<h1>Oman: Dibba al-Baya, Muscat, Ibra, Nizwa, Bahla, Ibri</h1>
<i>11-15 March 2023</i>
<h2>Dibba al-Baya</h2>
<p>
The Musandam Peninsula is separated from the main part of Oman by the territory of the UAE. There are two towns on the peninsula on both sides - Khasab and Dibba, and there is not even a road between them. The peninsula is made up of rocky mountains that rise sharply just off the coast, forming something similar to the Norwegian and New Zealand fjords.

<p>
Most excursions are from Dubai to Dibba, on the east coast, although the drive is about the same. In Dibba, entry through the border is simplified, without stamps. The town is more modest than the neighboring Emirati one.

<h2>Sohar</h2>
<p>
After standing at the border for three hours, I finally entered the main territory of Oman. There are still more than 300 kilometers to go to Muscat. The initial part of the route passes through mountains similar to those on the other side of the border.

<h2>Muscat</h2>
<p>
The capital of Oman confused me at first. I couldn’t figure out exactly where the center was: usually when you look at the map on your phone, the center is whereever the inscription with the name of the city is. But the bus arrived in a completely different place, and I didn’t find the Sultan’s palace there either. It turned out that historical Muscat is a small patch, sandwiched between the sea and rocks. It has nowhere to grow, so most of the city is located further along the sea to the northwest, stretching about 50 kilometers.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52787630843_de42c3b7ab_o.jpg">

<p>
Palace of the Sultan of Oman. Sultan Qaboos ruled Oman for 50 years, but he died in 2020, and now the new Sultan is Haitham. Of course, during such a long reign, everyone got used to Qaboos, his portraits are everywhere, all kinds of mosques, hospitals and universities are named after him.
<p/>

<p>
Both the past and the current Sultan appear on the banknotes. Since the Omani rial is worth 2.5 dollars, almost all the money is paper - down to 0.100 rial (right). There are coins smaller than 100 fils, but they are rare.

Oman has very good wide roads, major highways almost all the way along are multi-lane, although in the desert there is not much traffic.

<h2>Izki</h2>
<p>
I initially did not intend to visit the city of Izki; nothing was written about it in the guidebook, but looking at the map, I saw that it was not a standard Arab city with straight streets, but a labyrinth of small alleys, like in some old European city. So I drove there and didn’t regret it.

<p>
In the very center of this city lies a vast ghost district.

Apparently, these houses were abandoned because the residents moved to more comfortable houses made of modern materials. The old houses were made of clay, and are now gradually being destroyed.

Nizwa is the most popular tourist city in Oman and is famous for its fort.

One of the World Heritage Sites is the falaj or aflaj water canal system (in Arabic, falaj is singular, aflaj is plural). One of the listed falajs is located on the northern outskirts of Nizwa (although I later came across these canals in other towns not listed).

The first thing I did was drive up to the observation deck. On the map, it seemed that it was close to the center of Al-Hamra, and I thought that the center was on a hill, and this was like a terrace. But it turned out to be the opposite, the center is down in the valley, behind a grove of palm trees.

Then another 100 kilometers to the city of Ibri. On the way, it suddenly began to rain.

<h2>Ibri</h2>
<p>
Ibri is easily confused with Ibra, but in Arabic these names are very different - Ibri has an accent on the second syllable, and at the beginning there is also a guttural sound, denoted by the letter "ayn". Ibri is the capital of the Zahira province.

From the road I noticed a fortress on top of a layered rock.

Around the fortress, for the most part, there are some private areas with vegetable gardens, only in one direction there is a market and shops.

<h2>Bath</h2>
<p>
One of the World Heritage Sites in Oman are the excavations of Bath, Al Khutm and Al Ain. They are not far from Ibri, you just need to get off the highway and drive 10 kilometers following the signs.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52787177386_6a32e3f01f_o.jpg">
<p>
But when you arrive, it’s not very clear where to go - there’s no sign like “Welcome to Bath.” It's also not entirely clear from the maps where it is - several points are indicated, and not all of them are exactly on the road. At first I even passed the turn near this mosque, because there you need to turn onto a dirt road.
<p/>

Having circled around, I didn’t see anything at first.
<p/>

<p>
A large fence enclosed the area, running through the hills. In some places there were inscriptions on poles stating that archaeological excavations should not be destroyed.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52787177281_cf9f86f160_o.jpg">
<p>
In fact, you just need to park at this fence, walk to the place where it ends and sneak inside.
<p/>

From here it remained to get to Muscat. The road here is quite narrow by Omani standards, only two lanes.
