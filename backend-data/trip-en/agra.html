<h1>India: Agra, Fatehpur Sikri, Khajuraho, Varanasi</h1>
<i>26 April - 4 May 2017</i>
<h2>Agra</h2>
<p>
The state of Uttar Pradesh is the most (over)populated region of India, with 200 million people, and the level of development leaves much to be desired. If you want to see mountains of garbage reaching to the sky, soot in the air, rotting corpses on the streets, lepers, traffic jams of people and rickshaws - in general, everything that immediately comes to mind when you hear the word "India", then come here, and also to neighboring states of Bihar and West Bengal. Agra is one of the most visited cities in India because the Taj Mahal is located there.

<p>
If it were not for the ancient monuments left over from the times when Agra was the capital of the Mughal Empire, it would be an ordinary provincial city, not even the largest in the region.

The architecture of the old city for the most part represents the style of “I can build four walls of bricks, but there is no money for paint.”

The area between the fort and the Taj Mahal was improved: they simply demolished everything that was there and made a wide alley and a garden around the fence.

There are rumors about a long queue at the Taj Mahal, but this is nonsense. Firstly, there is a separate queue for foreigners. Secondly, if you enter not from the western side, where there is the fort and an alley for buses, but from the southern or eastern side of their city, then there is no queue for Indians too. Main entrance.

By the way, it turned out that the well-known white mausoleum of the Taj Mahal is located behind two levels of tall red walls. Here is the Taj Mahal from the side:

There is a river on the north side of it, there is no wall there. Theoretically, you can drive across the bridge to the other side and look from there, but the distance is rather long.

<h2>Fatehpur Sikri</h2>
<p>
Fatehpur Sikri is a small city about 20 kilometers from Agra, built in 1571 as the new capital of the Mughal Empire, because Emperor Akbar wanted it so. After 15 years he got tired of it, he left, and after another 20 years the city was abandoned. Now it looks like a huge fortress in an open field, because the residential area is still a little to the side.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256292283_53b6375fa2_o.jpg">
<p>
Fatehpur Sikri is listed as a UNESCO heritage site. You can get here cheaply by any bus going along the highway towards Jaipur. There is a huge market near the highway, and a gate towers above it.

<h2>Khajuraho</h2>
<p>
The village of Khajuraho is famous for its well-preserved Hindu and Jain temples from the 10th and 11th centuries. The once large city was abandoned in the 13th and 14th centuries, and was rediscovered only in the 19th, after which it essentially became a tourist town. The complex in Khajuraho gained particular fame compared to other numerous temples in India thanks to sculptures and bas-reliefs of an erotic nature, the presence of which shows that some thousand years ago India was not a backward ultra-conservative country, but a stronghold of free morals (like Ancient Greece and the Roman Empire) .
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256267261_22b0ee7249_o.jpg">
<p>
The form of these temples is quite typical for that part of India.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257014339_280372c965_o.jpg">
<p>
There is a group of the largest temples, where entry is paid (500 rupees), and many temples away from the center, which stand separately, and entry is free.

Moreover, there are very cheap hotels here (I lived for 200 rupees), there are no problems with accommodation for foreigners, and the town itself is also interesting. On the main street there are souvenir shops and hotels, but in the eastern part, where there are distant temples, it looks downright authentic.

<h2>Varanasi</h2>
<p>
Varanasi is the legendary city where Indians come to die, after which their bodies are burned and scattered over the sacred Ganges. It is also a very poor city, even by Indian standards, and a rather ugly city. This is where there is the maximum concentration of unpleasant individuals who sell marijuana and opium on street corners and engage in other shady activities.
<p/>

<p>
I'll start right away with the most pressing topic. Corpses have not been floating in the river for a long time, well, at least I have never seen one in 4 days. I would even say that the water in the river is surprisingly clean (by Indian standards). People even bathe and wash things.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254961092_a6bf135c8d_o.jpg">
<p>
The burning of the dead does not take place just anywhere, but in several specially designated places. The most famous is the staircase (ghat) of Manikarnika. It's next to these pillars, right now behind me. (By the way, the pink building could be an excellent observation deck, but it’s a power plant and the entrance is closed)
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254960977_48e1ac920b_o.jpg">
<p>
If you stand on the observation decks there, shady individuals will come up to you to tell you that you can’t take photographs, even if you are not trying to. The point is not in spirituality (what kind of spirituality can there be in India? This is a country more unspiritual than Russia), but in the fact that they have a selfish interest: if you pay money, then you can shoot, even a close up of the funeral pyre. The price of the issue seems to be several hundred dollars, that is, the strategy of targeting exclusively VIP clients has clearly been chosen. Not that I really want to, if it was simply said that it is impossible, then it would be reasonable, but the position “any whim for your money” in delicate religious matters is surprising.
On the neighboring streets there are deposits of firewood for a fire; there are different categories from the poor to the elite.

<p>
Some people take photos of the Manikarnika ghat off the water by renting a boat, but the boatman may get in the way. It’s easier to walk two kilometers along the river to the second place with approximately the same bonfires, this is already on the edge of the old city, and no one will care there, especially if you don’t get impudent and put on a lens with a longer focal length.
<p/>

<p>
By the way, there are special people who carry bodies to the burning place through the old part of the city, where it is impossible to drive a car, while singing out a tune.

In a year, 25-30 thousand bodies are burned in Varanasi, that is, less than a hundred per day for two ghats, that is, about once every half hour.

There is a very important Hindu temple in Varanasi, which has what appears to be a dome with a huge amount of gold in it. This temple seems to be large, but it is surrounded on all sides by narrow streets so that it is impossible to understand the scale; the entrance to the temple looks like the entrance to a dark gateway. Non-Hindus are not allowed there.

<h2>Sarnath</h2>
<p>
Very close to Varanasi is one of the four main places of pilgrimage for Buddhists. In general, Buddha lived in India, and his religion originally appeared here, but has now practically disappeared, having been supplanted by Hinduism and Islam. The four holy places are the birthplace of Buddha (Lumbini, Nepal - on the border with India), the place of enlightenment (Bodh Gaya, Bihar), the place of the first sermon (Sarnath) and the place of death and cremation (Kushinagar, Uttar Pradesh) .
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254961702_a49a264d97_o.jpg">
<p>
Since Buddhism died out in India many centuries ago, the main temple and the area around it fell into some disrepair.

Nowadays, with the advent of the opportunity for the general public to travel, pilgrims from countries where Buddhism is still widespread began to come to Sarnath. So modern temples began to be built around the archaeological zone.
