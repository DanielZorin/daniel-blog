<h1>Northern Cyprus: Kyrenia, Lefkosa</h1>
<i>27, 31 December 2013</i>
<h2>Lefkosa</h2>
<p>
In 1974, Cyprus wanted to join Greece. The Turks did not like this and occupied a third of the island. All the Greeks from there were kicked out, all the Turks from the south moved to the north. UN peacekeepers were stationed at the border.

It's been 40 years. Northern Cyprus is recognized only by Turkey, and this creates certain problems: after all, all connections with the outside world are through Istanbul, international companies cannot work, the country is economically isolated and lives off help from older brothers and smuggling to the south. Tourist infrastructure is either expensive or of poor quality. Due to its relative cheapness (compared to the European Union, but not to Turkey), the country attracts a number of downshifters (mostly Russians who need a visa to southern Cyprus), who buy houses and live here, although the prospects in the unrecognized state are rather doubtful. The local residents themselves do not like living in an unrecognized state; at one time, in a referendum, they voted for ending “independence” (a unique case among unrecognized self-proclaimed states) and joining the EU along with the south, but the Greeks were not so enthusiastic and voted against it, because they were not promised the return of the houses taken away in 1974. With the accession of southern Cyprus to the EU, the situation of the North improved, as there is now relative freedom of movement and more opportunities to work in the southern part.

The capital of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, Nicosia, also known as Lefkosa, is a pitiful sight. An unkempt, half-abandoned city, similar to a typical Middle Eastern outback, but not at all like Europe, in which it is politically located.

The only plus is that there are inexpensive hotels here, for about $30, although their condition is not impressive. If in the worst Russian and Tajik hotels it is clear that nothing has changed since 1991, then nothing has changed here since 1974.

<h2>Kyrenia</h2>
<p>
City of luxury. It is a haven for the rich with a few hotels with prices starting at $100.

The castle is much more decent than any in southern Cyprus, so excursions are brought here all the way from Limassol.

The only thing that reminds us of the TRNC is the monument to Ataturk and Turkish flags. Well, and the absence of McDonald's, probably.
