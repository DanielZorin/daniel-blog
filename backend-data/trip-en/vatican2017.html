<h1>Vatican</h1>
<i>13,15 January 2017</i>
<p>
The Vatican is the smallest state in the world. Most of the buildings in it are inaccessible to ordinary people without special passes: there even seems to be a grocery store and other infrastructure, but that’s all for those who work for the Pope. Tourists can visit St. Peter's Cathedral and the square in front of it (free), the museum with the Sistine Chapel, Raphael's rooms, etc. (entrance 16 euros, I was there in 2009), and the gardens where you can book a special tour (32 euros). There is also a combo tour that includes a visit to the Pope's residence on the outskirts of Rome, where you are transported by train directly from the Vatican.
Vatican's border runs along the circumference of the cathedral's colonnade.

To enter the square, you need to go through security.

Since I was in the Vatican last time (in 2009), two Popes changed. John Paul II is buried here in St. Peter's Basilica.

He is included in the list (this is a list of popes buried in the cathedral, so Benedict XVI is not here).

This is actually the only open place in the Vatican.

The Vatican is the only country that can easily be walked around in an hour. You can traverse <a href="../monaco">Monaco</a> and <a href="../gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> in 2-3 hours, and all other countries are larger.

Gate to the Vatican Museum. More precisely, the exit, the modest entrance is a little to the left. As you can see, in January there is a chance to get in without a giant queue.

I was lucky to be in Rome on Sunday, and on Sundays you have the chance to see the Pope. To do this, you just need to come to the square by noon.

I understood about 90% of his speech, despite my poor knowledge of Italian. The Pope spoke very slowly and clearly.
