<h1>Cambodia: Siem Reap, Angkor, Kratie, Banlung, Stung Treng</h1>
<i>11-23 December 2015</i>
<h2>Roads</h2>
<p>
There are no passenger trains or domestic flights (except for rare flights from Sihanoukville to Siem Reap) in Cambodia, so to get around the country you will have to sit on buses. Locals still ride in the back of trucks, but it is much slower, uncomfortable, and for tourists the price is the same as a bus. The bus system in Cambodia is organized inconveniently, so it is difficult to understand it from the outside. There are a bunch of companies, all of them have their own offices and departure points at different ends of the city. There are bus stations, usually on the outskirts, even in small towns. The bus station is just a large field with buses, where sometimes there are folding tables with ticket sellers. With the exception of the Capitol company, whose station is located in the center of Phnom Penh, tourists can actually buy tickets at a travel agency or city ticket office with taxi to the bus station included.

I have no idea how transfers are organized. We drove from Siem Reap to Banlung all day from 8 am to 10 pm, with two transfers in Kampong Cham and Kratie. It was a regular bus to Kampong Cham, and then two minibuses, in which, fortunately, we managed to grab seats in the front row, where it was not so crowded. How money paid in Siem Reap is transferred to a company without a sign that owns minibuses on the other side of the country, I don’t know. However, I didn’t notice that locals paid anything at all on these minibuses. Although there seem to be tariffs at the Kratie bus station.

<p>
This is what a minibus looks like at the Kratie bus station.
<p/>

Bus station. Luckily, it is located in the central square.
<p/>

<p>
We waited here for an hour and a half for a minibus to Banlung. There were already passengers there, they sat us down and drove us to this house about a kilometer from the bus station.
<p/>

<p>
And then they took me back and dropped me off!
<p/>

<p>
Again near this temple. Another minibus immediately arrived and we were invited to it. Then this minibus drove up to the auto repair shop and the driver and a couple of other men spent a long time loading a huge wheel for a tractor into the cabin. But in the end we reached Banlung.

<p>
Roads in Cambodia 20 years ago were completely absent; travel was only possible along rivers, especially during the rainy season. Now there is virtually no river transport, and all major cities are connected by normal roads.
<p/>

<p>
This is the highway from Phnom Penh to the Thai border via Battambang. Decent throughout.
<p/>

<p>
But the road from Phnom Penh to Siem Reap north of Tonle Sap Lake let us down. There is a section of about 50 kilometers where the road is laid out in the best traditions of remote Russian villages. This section can be driven around along a normal road with a small detour, but the bus chose to drag along this dusty patch of potholes.
<p/>

<p>
The speed of travel in Cambodia is low - about 40-50 kilometers per hour.
<p/>

<p>
Every self-respecting bus will have an entertainment program. It consists of the Cambodian comedy shows and a selection of music videos. Cambodian videos were made at the technical level of Russia in the early 1990s. The average plot is like this. The singer and his girlfriend are sitting in a street eatery, where they are enjoying fried noodles for a dollar. Then the girl meets a rich prince and leaves with him in a cool car, and the singer suffers and dreams of returning her. There is no happy ending.
It is better not to travel on buses at night, because the entertainment program will disturb your sleep.
<p/>

<p>
The buses stop every few hours for a pit stop at a roadside restaurant. It looks something like this. All restaurants in Cambodia have a bright red sign with a telephone number and the logo of one of the beer brands: Angkor, Anchor or Cambodia. In tourist places the name is written in English, in non-tourist places - only in Khmer.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256256139_b2d6fe1998_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Billboards advertising beer stand along all the roads.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255507136_06ab309636_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I didn’t like the food at these roadside restaurants; I always took a supply of food with me. In general, in my opinion, it’s inconvenient to spend half an hour on these lunch breaks instead of getting there faster. In Europe, for example, buses do not stop except to drop off passengers. I suspect that the bus companies make a profit from these restaurants.
<p/>

<p>
Moreover, the prices there are not low - eating rice costs $2.5. I only bought fruit at these stations, if they had it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254777152_f0c01d11c1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The rest of the time I walked along the highway.
<p/>

<p>
The buses are mostly decommissioned from Korea, China and Japan. The inscriptions in Korean remain on this one.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255712323_8bd262a04c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Pit stops are useful because they have a toilet. Toilets are free. Can you understand where is male and where is female? There is a special person sitting near the entrance who will tell you.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256552215_f62c37b724_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Once we stopped at some pretentious place for a pit stop.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256552380_bec3164e7f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There was even a sculptural composition at the entrance.

<p>
And next to it is a gorgeous building. These are found along highways even in small Cambodian cities.
<p/>

<p>
It would be better if we got to Siem Reap right away, there were only 50 kilometers left.
<p/>
<h2>Siem Reap</h2>
<p>
Siem Reap mostly consists of hotels and restaurants serving tourists coming to Angkor (which is 90 percent of all visitors to Cambodia). There is little of interest, it is all somewhere far from the center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254777837_014909450d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The average street in Siem Reap looks neater and newer than the average in Cambodia.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255507656_badaa01649_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The main streets are filled with bars and pubs. In terms of the degree of westernization, Siem Reap is superior to Phnom Penh.
<p/>

<p>
Since Siem Reap is very touristy, it is difficult to find food at reasonable prices in the center. I most often dined at one establishment where the prices were normal, $1.5-2 per dish. Steven Corner.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255507716_ba36c7dd6d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The signature dish is grilled ribs.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256552640_2975dcc4f1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I came across an unknown fruit while walking around. Attempts to find out its name from sellers were unsuccessful. Much later, I learned the name from the Thais and found out that it was Limonia Acidissima, or elephant apple. The taste is strange, like cinnamon cake.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255507791_d47d3501eb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Travel agencies sell bus tickets. You can get to Phnom Penh for just $4.5. To Banlung (Ratanakiri), the cheapest I found was $16, the rest were asking for $22-25.

The sumo laundry also has a branch here.

<p>
Angkor is located north of Siem Reap. If you drive along the main road towards Angkor, there will be luxury, expensive hotels on both sides.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254778027_292b1faab8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The New Year was approaching, Christmas trees were being placed near hotels.

<p>
A flock of flying foxes lives in one of the main squares of Siem Reap. These are animals similar to bats, only much larger.
<p/>

They look impressive in photographs, but in reality they shy away from people, preferring to sit high in trees, where they can only be reached with a very big lens.
<p/>

<h2>Angkor</h2>
<p>
Angkor is the most famous place in Cambodia, and throughout Southeast Asia. They often say and write “Angkor Wat”, meaning the entire archaeological park, but this is incorrect, because Angkor Wat is only one temple, although many people’s acquaintance with Angkor ends there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255090842_69e9481eee_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In 90% of photographs, Angkor Wat appears to be standing over a lake.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256863890_10d4883f10_h.jpg"/>
<p>
When you first approach from Siem Reap, it’s not clear: there seems to be a wide ditch, with the temple itself in the distance.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256568629_b0917c659b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In fact, the reflection is being filmed in this puddle.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256568694_05a5e10364_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Hundreds of people come to Angkor Wat at five in the morning to photograph the sunrise over this puddle in the terrible crowd and crush. If you wish, you can shoot here.
<p/>

<p>
Entrance to Angkor costs $20. You can also buy a three-day ticket for $40, but I decided it was better to get up early and see everything in one day. All tickets are personalized and with photographs taken right at the ticket office, so you won’t be able to take someone else’s three-day ticket. Theoretically, if you use Photoshop, a ticket can be faked, since it is checked only with the eyes, the barcode is not read. But most of those who got to Angkor for free simply ran from the controllers. In principle, you can even enter the territory along a secondary road without control, not to mention walking through the forest, where there are no fences. The problem is that you need to somehow move around the territory: you can’t walk 40 kilometers in a day in the heat, and you can’t ride a bicycle either. All significant temples will also have to be accessed from the back entrance, so I think it makes sense to spend $20 here. As a means of transport, then you can take a tuk-tuk with a driver; you can move around quickly and inexpensively - within $15 for the whole day. You can rent a car, but it is much more expensive and inconvenient to drive on narrow roads. You cannot rent a motorcycle (this would ruin the tuk-tuk business), unless you rent it in another province and come on it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256022408_e733b0c87d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
First you need to decide on the route. If you are not an archaeologist, then it hardly makes sense to visit absolutely all temples, including those located 20-30 kilometers from the main ones. To consolidate knowledge about the Khmer Empire, you can later visit Khmer temples in Thailand (Phanom Rung, Phimai) and Laos (Wat Phu). Based on online reports and area surveys, most tourists go to the other extreme, visiting only three points - Angkor Wat, Bayon and Ta Prohm. You won’t be able to do more with the excursion, because you need a couple of hours for lunch and another couple of hours to wait for those who are late.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256912213_c3cd52e816_h.jpg"/>
<p>
To better understand the situation, I will insert a map. The square surrounded by a moat in the middle is Angkor Thom, once the largest city in the world. To the south is Angkor Wat, the main temple. The center of Siem Reap is 6-7 kilometers to the south. Accordingly, first you come to Angkor Wat, then to Angkor Thom. From there you can move in two directions. If you go east, you get the so-called “Small Circle”. There will be the popular Ta Prohm temple and a couple more. The road will turn south and lead back to Angkor Wat. If you go north, you get the "Great Circle". Since in the “Small Circle” there are essentially only two temples (but large ones), it can be combined with a large one; the detour from the road to Ta-Prom is small. I would also like to note that if you have a ticket for the next day, you can visit Angkor Wat after 5 pm. There is definitely not enough time before sunset for a full visit, but it will still significantly save time on the main day. I visited Angkor Wat at the very end.
You shouldn’t waste time on lunch, it’s still expensive to eat on the territory of Angkor, and going to the city is a waste of an hour of time. It’s wise to stop at a store and market on the way in the morning, stock up on high-calorie food, fortunately you don’t need to carry anything with you, you can leave it in a tuk-tuk.
<p/>

<p>
It is impossible to avoid getting into the crowd in Angkor, or rather, it is impossible at the main points. You have to accept that the road to Angkor Wat will look like this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256568669_2d8c13d30b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
These are people leaving because everything is already closing.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256568834_8810e5606d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is no quick way to get around Angkor Wat; it is the largest temple in the whole world.
<p/>

<p>
The maximum level you can climb to is to the base of the five towers. There is only one entrance and there is a queue to get there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255093547_5a812fcd5d_h.jpg"/>

The lower levels can be walked freely.

At about 8 am I was near Bayon, exactly 10 minutes before the first large tour group appeared there.
<p/>

After Bayon you can walk through the ancient city. The map shows that the buildings are only in the very middle. The rest is mostly forest, something like this. Ordinary people who lived there did not build houses from stone.
<p/>

As soon as you enter a not-so-top temple, the crowd becomes much smaller. This is Baphuon.

<p>
Around in the forest you can see small piles of stones - the remains of fences.
<p/>

In this area there were buildings of the royal palace. If you go north off the main road, you can see a lot of interesting things.

It's interesting to go a little deeper into the forest. There are thousand-year-old bricks lying around in it.

<p>
In the central temples, all the bricks were probably replaced with new ones long ago, but here, perhaps, they have been lying around for a thousand years.

I think a big part of the fun of visiting Angkor is visiting a few of these secluded places.

Through the overgrown window you can see a huge tuk-tuk parking lot.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256569779_dc2328e907_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is the temple.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255821451_fc036fc2a9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Across the small road there will be another temple with a huge pile of stones at the base.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255821496_c1bb2b4419_h.jpg"/>

<p>
Then we took the tuk-tuk north, towards the big circle. The entrance gate is well preserved.
<p/>

<p>
The temples in Angkor all consist of approximately the same elements - stupas, gates, bas-reliefs are quite similar, although different temples have very different layouts. A sort of designer. By the end of the day, the details begin to become boring.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255092762_9164fe9047_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The first temple to the north is Preah Khan. It’s very big, it takes about 15 minutes to walk through in one direction.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256865280_845e691ef2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The same chain stands on the bridges at the entrances to Angkor Thom.

<p>
In this temple you can see colorful trees whose roots entwine the walls. That is, approximately the same as in the Ta Prohm temple, but in a more intimate setting without a crowd.
<p/>

In the lake on the man-made island there are also the remains of a kind of water temple.

<p>
The unexpectedly beautiful Prerup Temple is the last in the “big circle”.

<p>
By the way, if you wish, it is very easy to get into this temple without a ticket - the walls at the back are full of holes and are not guarded in any way.
<p/>

They say that during the day it’s the busiest place, but in the evening it’s better.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255822426_ab913374b2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This temple is famous for the trees that grow through the walls.

<p>
For some reason, Angelina Jolie, who played the main role in a rather passable Hollywood film, one of the episodes of which was filmed here, is often mentioned in connection with this temple.
<p/>

I even watched Tomb Raider. It also features James Bond and Lord of the Friendzone (from Game of Thrones).

Although I rode a tuk-tuk, exploring Angkor still took a lot of energy: you often need to climb stairs, and the distance you need to walk through the temples is quite considerable. This was the last temple before Angkor Wat.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255822776_58d3f6c540_h.jpg"/>

It's good that I didn't ride a bike.

<h2>Banlung</h2>
<p>
To explore the Cambodian hinterland, I went to the city of Banlung, which is located near the junction of the borders of Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. This is practically the remotest corner of the region. Here you can even find such a rarity for Cambodia in modern times as off-road conditions - if you try to travel south to Sen Monorom.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255891256_929482b1b2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I traveled from Siem Reap to Banlung all day - from seven in the morning to ten in the evening. The minibus stopped at the central square, where I checked into the first hotel for only 5 dollars. The hotel was very decent, there was Wi-fi and hot water.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255161147_a6a4aa2767_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But there was no air conditioning, that's why it was so cheap. And now the best part: in Banlung you don’t really need air conditioning! Vietnamese <a href="../saigon">Dalat</a>, by the way, is not far from here, the border is open, even buses run regularly.

Dinner at a local cafe. There are still few Western-style establishments in Banlung, and they close early.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256638894_d1d5f5de0b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This dinner costs 5,000 riel ($1.25). The meat, of course, is not for everybody - some weird pieces.

The market is also located here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256638974_cb6eff7802_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Gold and precious stones are mined in this region. At the market, next to meat and fruit, there are rows of stalls with jewelry.

Banlung is no longer the end of the world, but a civilized city. The ubiquitous sumo laundromat chain has even made its way here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256639159_055ae4409a_h.jpg"/>

They are even building a skyscraper near the highway - as many as 8 floors.
<p/>

Chinese investors are building large hotels in Banlung. So far I haven’t found any tourist groups here, but individual travelers are already exploring this region.
<p/>

<p>
Let's walk along the highway to the east. There are all sorts of strange vehicles driving on the roads, like trucks without a cab.
<p/>

I went to this village for a reason: here is Lake Yaklom - one of the most beautiful places in Cambodia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256639939_857da96b1d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This lake is on the site of an extinct volcano.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256934075_be36a09262_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Therefore, it has an almost perfectly round shape.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256092798_9bc042f75e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The lake is already quite popular among tourists. There is a Cambodian style seating area around it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256934125_20e9b09771_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You can go around the lake along paths.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255161962_eb46563495_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In some places there are piers from which you can jump into the water. The water is clean.

The second day in Banlung began with renting a motorcycle with a driver for a ride around the area.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256093493_71e098e433_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The plan was to see three waterfalls, but the driver either misunderstood or did not want to go to the third one, which is located away from the other two. However, for 4 dollars such a trip is inexpensive. Anyway, the first waterfall is called Ka Chang. Entry to each waterfall costs $0.5.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256093148_b80ec27771_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You can swim below, which is what I did. The conditions are wild, you have to make your way over the rocks carefully.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256640174_47925c9cc9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You can also walk along the top between the streams of water.

The second waterfall, Ka Tien, is located not far from the first, about 3 kilometers.
<p/>

Near the waterfall you can ride elephants, and there is one “restaurant” with a grill.

Banlung is not hot, picturesque, and the city is small - nature is easy to get to. A wonderful combination.

On the third day, I went alone to conquer the third waterfall - Cha Ong. To make life less of a hassle, I rented a bicycle for $2.

<p>
At first everything was simple - it was pleasant to drive on smooth asphalt, there were many lanes, and the traffic was not fast. To warm up, I taxied to a local monastery.

The temple is quite typical for Cambodia.

<p>
After dragging the bike up the hill along the dirt road, I reached the statue of the reclining Buddha. There might have been a good view of the city from there, if not for the trees.

But along the way there was a good view away from the city - towards the fields.

It's a 7-8 km drive from the city center to the waterfall. The second half of the journey is no longer on asphalt. There immediately goes a rather sharp descent, on which the road is riddled with potholes and bumps. Since the bike seat was not very soft, I had to walk part of the way. Some quarries are visible along the way.
<p/>

<p>
But it was about 1 kilometer, then the road was quite flat. On the sides are Hevea plantations.

This waterfall seems to be the least popular among tourists. During the entire time I was lying there on the grass, taking a break from the trip, not a single person appeared. Only on the way there, a couple of Europeans on motorcycles were driving towards us.

There's a jungle all around. There are no restaurants near the waterfall; food and water can be bought 500 meters from the entrance in the village.

I decided to take a different road back, marked on the Maps.Me map. This decision led to me having some adventures. The road from the wide dirt road that was in the village turned into a narrow path. There was another village there, when I taxied there, the children even stopped playing and began to look at me in surprise, apparently, such fruits do not fly there every day. After the village, the path went down sharply.
<p/>

<p>
In principle, there are not as many bumps here as there were on the descent on the way “there”, but I did not dare to ride, but walked. After this descent there was a small bridge over a river, a vegetable garden, and the same sharp rise, up which, of course, the bike also had to be dragged. After this, 2-3 kilometers were on flat ground, first through a large garden with some trees, then through another village, which was not even marked on the map. But after the village there was another test.

It was necessary to go down this road and then go up again. By the way, this is the only road to that village. A lot of schoolchildren were walking towards me after school (the school was apparently in Banlung), some of them were also dragging bicycles. But rare motorcyclists rode bravely along this road. You can’t drag a motorcycle along with you as easily as a bicycle.

<p>
Finally I reached the outskirts of Banlung. There was asphalt! After all the paths, driving on this asphalt was simply a pleasure.

<h2>Stung Treng</h2>
<p>
The city of Stung Treng is hidden on the northern outskirts of Cambodia near the border with Laos. Once upon a time it was possible to get there only by boat along the Mekong, but now the roads are quite normal, the city is developing and becoming similar to other cities.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255560316_adb33ab9ac_h.jpg"/>
<p>
People come to Stung Treng for one purpose - transit to Banlung, Kratie or Laos. The border with Laos and 4,000 islands are located about 50 kilometers away; there are no cities or settlements closer to the border. I stayed at the most luxurious hotel in Stung Treng, the Riverside, for $7.

In Stung Treng, I very cunningly exchanged dollars for Lao kip. In Cambodia, the rate is traditionally very good, the spread is minimal. But on the 4000 islands the rate is very bad, because the place is very touristy, and there are no banks or ATMs there.
