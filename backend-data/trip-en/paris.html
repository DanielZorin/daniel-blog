<h2>Paris</h2>
<p>
What can I say this about Paris. Yes, there are blacks, Arabs, tourists and garbage, but even with all this, Paris remains Paris, and <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/275230.html">[insert the name of a typical Bumfuck here]</ a> even without blacks and Arabs it will remain a hole.

If you are not a millionaire ready to pay a hundred euros for a taxi, then your first acquaintance with Paris after the airport will take place at the notorious Gare du Nord.

Cheap hotels, of course, are located in very interesting areas.

It’s easy to understand from the advertisement who lives here.

The ultra-right is stigmatized here.

I wanted to see the very bottom of Paris, so I went to Saint Denis. Saint-Denis is famous for having a high crime rate and more than a third of the population being immigrants.

<p>
In reality, everything turned out to be not so bad. There was only one outstanding house in the entire block.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256824058_cef87e9734_o.jpg">
<p>
The main street of Saint-Denis is similar to the main street of some small but lively town.

<p>
It’s not very safe to leave your car in Saint-Denis; they might even get burned. Although when there were riots in France a few years ago with street fighting, they took place in the neighborhoods east and southeast of Saint Denis.

When I photographed the sign of a hair salon doing afro hair, a black man came out of it, and I had to explain myself in broken French. As a result, we parted amicably.
<p/>

Saint-Denis has its own street signs, not the same as in Paris.
<p/>

There is also a cathedral where almost all the French kings are buried.

Crowd of tourists. What is typical is that 100 meters away there is a parallel street where there is no crowd.

Have you seen enough? Now we can speculate about what the main feature of Paris is, why this city can be called the capital of the world (one of them). The fact is that Paris is the center of everything new and grandiose. For Paris, nothing is sacred, and this, by the way, in a sense makes it similar to Moscow. When Stalin demolished almost all of old Moscow and half of the Kremlin in addition, it was somewhat dangerous to complain about this, so the habit of scolding the authorities for urban planning initiatives appeared under Luzhkov. Paris went through this back in the nineteenth century, when the Eiffel Tower was built.
<p/>

<p>
The Eiffel Tower broke the pattern of Paris at that time, although, it must be said, the city was already relatively new, not medieval.

What do we need a pyramid in the courtyard of the Louvre?
<p/>

<p>
Let's continue the composition, so to speak, by placing a Ferris wheel near the obelisk.

<p>
Another template-breaking place is the courtyard of the Palais Royal. Cardinal Richelieu once lived there, and now there are striped columns there.

Why should we build a house like this two steps from the Louvre?

It is possible to organize a construction project on a larger scale.

Graffiti and other drawings no longer even look countercultural.

Can you imagine such lighting in an Orthodox church?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257006188_bac90a518d_o.jpg">
<p>
What do you think of this icon? I can already hear curses from Orthodox fundamentalists. This, by the way, is not some small schismatic church, but the main cathedral of France - Notre Dame.

It is not surprising that it was in Paris that the place where bones were collected from most of the city's cemeteries was turned into a tourist attraction.

I must say that people who use their iPhones to take selfies against the backdrop of mountains of bones are somewhat puzzling.

Since we're talking about dungeons, I'll note that the Paris metro is quite good
<p/>

<p>
The passages are maze-like in places, but the navigation is decent.
<p/>

<p>
The navigation at exits is especially good.
<p/>

<p>
There are also unusual stations.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255894867_627de03aa0_o.jpg">
<p>
The taxi is advertised by McDonald's. Real division by zero. Those who take taxis do not go to McDonald's.

I looked into the castle of Vincennes, from where the Duke of Beaufort once fled.
<p/>

A newlywed couple met here. The bride smoked in her white dress.

<p>
In one of the Macs there were machines where you can place and pay for an order, and then only receive it. Very convenient, especially in light of the fact that, as a rule, McDonald's do not have a clear menu. Many have a menu on the wall to the side, but it doesn't include the specials that are displayed on other screens.
<p/>

Huge automatic store. In essence, this is a machine with chocolates and drinks, only enlarged 10 times. Only such establishments are open 24 hours a day.
<p/>
