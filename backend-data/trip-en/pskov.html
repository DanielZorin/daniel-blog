<h1>Russia: Pskov, Vybuty, Pechory, Izborsk, Melyotovo</h1>
<i>25-28 August 2012</i>
<h2>Pskov</h2>
<p>
I stood and rubbed my eyes. Is this really Russia? Surely not Tallinn, not Stockholm, not Copenhagen, not Berlin, not Rio de Janeiro? The street is paved with tiles, there are no cracks on the facades of the houses, the paint is fresh and not a depressing gray color, there is no garbage lying on the ground, there are no cars parked in three rows on the road.
<p/>

<p>
This is Pskov, the most European city in Russia.
<p/>

<p>
The city is improving gradually. The farthest outskirts still look shabby, but closer to the center, order has already been restored.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257413919_31481a7cb8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Pskov is surrounded by a very wide ring of old fortress walls, around which decent modern areas are concentrated.

<p>
The best place is Zapskovye, as the name suggests, located across the Pskova River.
<p/>

<p>
In the very center of the city there is also a small ring of Kremlin walls.
<p/>

<p>
The center takes care of the historical heritage.

<p>
Along the outer wall there are memorial signs, unlike other cities, they are not only in honor of the Second World War.

<p>
As befits a European city, liberal and democratic sentiments are strong here.
<p/>

<p>
The buses are new and shiny. The city map shows routes, although there are none at the stops. A ticket costs 16 rubles.
<p/>

<p>
And here is the schedule. Having a sponsor has done good; at least the exact time has already been indicated.

<h2>Pechory</h2>
<p>
When I approached Pechory, I received an SMS with the news that I was in international roaming in Estonia. The border here is three kilometers away, and until 1939 it was an Estonian province. The European influence here is even stronger than in Pskov; just look at this bus schedule, ideal in all respects, with all stops on the route indicated down to the minute. Pechory Buss rules.

<p>
The city center looks quite European.

<p>
There is an incredibly beautiful monastery here, so there are a lot of tourists here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257668835_af7e33471a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The monastery is kept in excellent condition.

In appearance it resembles Ukrainian Baroque.

An example of a very unfortunate name for a bank: you just want to insert the letter “e”.

<h2>Izborsk</h2>
<p>
There is no roaming in Izborsk, and the landscape is different.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256222611_72ea8258d8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The city once stood on these hills, but now there is only a cemetery here, and the city has moved to the fortress area.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256421008_90699527e9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Even later, New Izborsk was founded, quite far from the old one.

<p>
The Izborsk fortress is now completely covered in forests. They decided to make it more attractive to tourists by repairing and completing the collapsed towers. It is easy to see where the completed part begins.

I was sure that scarecrows only exist in cartoons, and in reality they disappeared a hundred years ago. It turned out that there are scarecrows with a Kalashnikov assault rifle.

<h2>Vybuty</h2>
<p>

<p/>

It is believed that Princess Olga was born here.

<p>
Meletovo is notable for the fact that there are two churches there. One was built at the beginning of the 20th century and is now completely destroyed from the inside. The other has been standing here since the mid-15th century. It has more or less been restored, but the building has not been given to the Russian Orthodox Church, so they have not yet had time to hang icons of Saints Gundyaev, Putin and other church fathers. There are scaffoldings installed inside, along which you can climb all the way to the dome.
