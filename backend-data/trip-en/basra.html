<h1>Iraq: Basra, Nasiriyah, Najaf, Karbala</h1>
<i>29-31 October 2023</i>
<h2>Basra</h2>
<p>
Basra is a major port city in southern Iraq. Basra is located near the confluence of the Shatt al-Arab River into the Persian Gulf. The Shatt al-Arab is the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates.

<p>
I arrived in Basra from Baghdad by overnight train. The railway through Iraq to the Persian Gulf was built at the beginning of the 20th century, when this territory belonged to the Ottoman Empire. Germany financed the project, since it was beneficial for them to have a railway leading directly to the Indian Ocean through the territories of the allied countries (Austria-Hungary and Turkey) bypassing the Suez Canal. Britain, on the contrary, sought to prevent this project. Before the war, the road was not even completed to Baghdad, and it was finished by the British, who received Iraq for themselves. Now Baghdad-Basra is the only long-distance train in Iraq.

There is some historical architecture preserved here, which is rare for Iraq, and for the Middle East in general.

I walked around the old city for some time looking for such houses. In fact, there are quite few of them, I included almost everything that I saw in this post.

<h2>Nasiriyah</h2>
<p>
From Basra I went to Nasiriyah. Until very recently, it was very difficult to get into this city; an invitation was required. But recently entry was made free. Nasiriya is interesting mainly for the ruins of the ancient city of Ur, which are nearby.
<p/>

The city itself is quite dusty and not particularly noteworthy.

The southern part of the city is richer, it is clear that the houses here are decent.

I'm driving through the desert to the ruins of Ur. On the other side of the road there is a high security prison, which is why the city was so closed before.

It is interesting that in ancient times the city was near the seashore, since the sea level was higher. The Euphrates and Tigris flowed into the sea separately.

<h2>Najaf</h2>
<p>
Najaf is the main city for Shia pilgrimage in Iraq. Najaf is home to the mausoleum of Imam Ali, a central figure for Shiites. In general, the Shiites initially isolated themselves due to the fact that they considered Ali to be the true heir of Muhammad, and after Ali - his children and other close relatives, while the Sunnis did not consider kinship to be the main criterion for choosing a leader. In general, Shiites are characterized by the veneration of various historical figures as saints and martyrs, while Sunnis consider them idolaters for this.
<p/>

<p>
There is a huge purely pedestrian area around the Ali Mosque, and three circles of control. On the outside, cars are not allowed, and people are barely searched. The second circle is around the perimeter of the mosque, where all the bags are necessarily x-rayed.

The city of Kufa is 10 kilometers from Najaf. In fact, now these two cities have united. In the 7th century these were two different cities. Imam Ali was killed in the central mosque of Kufa.

<h2>Karbala</h2>
<p>
Karbala is the second holy city for Shiites. In 680, Ali's second son and heir, Hussein, was killed here. This event is called the "Battle of Karbala", although I would not call 150 people against 5000 a battle - more like a massacre. In memory of the martyrdom of Hussein, on the main Shia holiday of Ashura, pilgrims beat themselves with whips.
<p/>

In Karbala there are two large mosques opposite each other. Al-Abbas, Hussein's half-brother and his standard-bearer, is buried in the first one.
