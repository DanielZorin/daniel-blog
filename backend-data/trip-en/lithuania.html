<h1>Lithuania: Siauliai, Vilnius, Kaunas, Trakai</h1>
<i>6-9 May 2012</i>
<h2>Siauliai</h2>
<p>
There are not many places in the world that could be called unique and inimitable in themselves. For example, as much as I love Rio de Janeiro, I wouldn’t say that the statue of Jesus on Corcovado is particularly outstanding, other than the fact that it offers a good view (the vuew from Sugarloaf no worse). I am sure that this is not the first and not the last large statue in an open place; even in Ancient Greece there was such a wonder of the world as the “Colossus of Rhodes”.

One of the unique, amazing and fantastic places on Earth is located on the outskirts of a small and inconspicuous country called Lithuania, which I think most people have a vague idea of ​​and confuse with neighboring Latvia.

<p>
The road here starts from the city of Siauliai by bus. In principle, if you have a lot of time, you can walk 10 kilometers.

There is a small village called Domantai.

People bring small crosses and place them on the ground between the large ones.
<p/>

<p/>

The mountain was destroyed several times during Soviet times, but each time it was restored. This place became famous after the visit of John Paul II twenty years ago.

<h2>Vilnius</h2>
<p>
Vilnius is the hidden gem of Europe. In general, the entire country of Lithuania is absolutely underestimated by travelers. Vilnius is beautiful in everything. Here you can see an old European city with cobbled streets, churches, palaces. But now we will not even talk about that, and enjoy the courtyards.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255714741_e2b035b964_o.jpg">
<p>
Vilnius is such a northern Odessa. Or Odessa is Vilnius on the Black Sea?

For a Catholic country, Lithuania is very religious. I have never seen people praying on their knees in a Catholic church before.
