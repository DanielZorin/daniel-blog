<h1>USA: Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Las Cruces, Alamogordo, Carlsbad, Roswell, Bandelier</h1>
<i>5-10 February 2020</i>
<h2>Truth or Consequences</h2>
<p>
Less than seven years have passed since <a href="http://goo.gl/rC1jku">my first trip to the USA</a>, and finally I was able to do what I had long wanted - a road trip across America. The choice fell on the state of New Mexico because 1. It is not as cold in February as in the north 2. It is not so far to fly from the West coast 3. There is a lot to see. I arrived in the evening in Albuquerque, the largest city in the state, rented a car at the airport and checked into a nearby motel. Having thought through it, I decided not to explore Albuquerque the next day, but to immediately go south: I didn’t want to immediately drive a car into the center of a big city in an unfamiliar country, but I wanted to experimentally find out how far I could drive in a day. The maximum goal for the first day was to get to the White Sands National Park (about 450 kilometers), but it was possible to stay at a motel in any of the cities along the road.
<p/>

<p>
The motel is really accessible only by car - there are large highways on three sides, and a river on the fourth.
<p/>

<p>
My room. The price is about 45 dollars, I paid about the same in subsequent days in other cities.
<p/>

<p>
My car, Hyundai Accent. The mileage on the odometer showed zero: either the car was really new (it was quite possible because it looked fresh), or it had somehow been reset to zero.
<p/>

<p>
On one side of the motel there was an interstate highway leading south all the way to the Mexican border in El Paso. The interstate highway looks something like this. There are two lanes in each direction, with a fairly wide divider between them. A third lane is added on exit ramps, so you don't have to change lanes unless you're passing someone. Speed ​​limits range from 90-120 km/h (75 mph maximum in this state), but many drivers go a little faster because there are no fines for going 10 mph over the speed limit.
<p/>

<p>
About 70 kilometers after Albuquerque, on my side of the road there was the first rest area where you can pull off and relax a little. There are also picnic cabins.
<p/>

The landscape around is something like this.

<p>
You can’t go there into the distance because there is a fence along the entire route (here I’m filming on top of it).

The mountains have become closer, there are more thorny bushes on the ground.
<p/>

<p>
Cars cannot be parked in rest areas for long periods of time, apparently so that no one lives here in mobile homes. Fine up to $100.
<p/>

First stop in the city after more than 200 kilometers. The city is called Truth or Consequences and deserves a visit for its name. It was originally called Hot Springs in honor of the nearby mineral springs, and in 1950, on a popular radio show, the host promised an anniversary special from the city that would be renamed after the show. That's how the name remained. The population of this city is about 6 thousand people.
<p/>

<p>
I parked at this building. Since the city is small, parking is free everywhere; you can also stop along the sidewalks if the width of the road allows.
<p/>

Previously it was a school, but now it is a district court.

The main street. There are shops along it, all with large parking lots. Family dollar is like our Fixed price.

There is a small historical center where the buildings are more densely packed.

There is also a central square here. Palm trees, benches. At the opposite end is the city hall.

<p>
I easily walked around the center, and in general it is not very different organizationally from the center of some small city in Russia or Europe. There is just no railway station or bus station, and all sorts of grocery stores are not in the center, but along the big street leading to the highway. And no one walks, although in principle there are conditions for this, but the locals do not have such a habit.

The wind causes them to have vertical cliffs, which is why they are called mesa (table) in Spanish.

<h2>Las Cruces</h2>
<p>
In the rather large city of Las Cruces, I had to turn off the interstate highway onto a local one. By this time I had already traveled more than 300 kilometers. I couldn’t completely miss such a big city, so I stopped in the very center and went out for a walk.
<p/>

The main street. If you drive straight along it, after a while it will turn into a highway towards the city of Alamogordo, which is exactly where I needed to go.

<p>
Cinema. It has clearly been preserved here since the 1920s (there’s even a sign hanging on the side). Traditionally, the cinema building is one of the most elegant, like the theater building in old European cities, but here the cities were built in an era when cinema became more important.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256749703_e8c80a2882_o.jpg">
<p>
Main square. There’s even a stage and benches, but I didn’t meet a single person in the whole city. It seems that this is some kind of cargo cult - they made benches, like in Europe, but the residents still don’t use them.
<p/>

Residential area behind the fence. When you drive through this city, there are quite a few of these closed communities. It is interesting that the architecture even here preserves local traditions, at least in terms of the sandy color of the walls.

Before leaving, I took a trip to the nearby historic town of Mesilla (5 kilometers from downtown Las Cruces).

Here in the central square there is a huge cathedral, reminiscent of Mexico. The cathedral was built in 1906.

This is what the local indigenous Pueblo Indians did at home - the walls were made of clay bricks, and the roof was supported by long logs, the ends of which looked out.

About 40 minutes later I reached White Sands.

<h2>White Sands</h2>
<p>
White Sands State Park is New Mexico's most visited attraction. In the middle of the steppe there is a small area strewn with snow-white sand (particles of gypsum), as if it were a desert with dunes, only white.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256750918_3a35e31d42_o.jpg">
<p>
A national monument differs from a national park in that architectural/sculptural structures can also be added to the monuments, but in this case there is not much difference. White Sands was raised in status from a monument to a park at the very end of 2019; not all signs had time to change at that time.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256750398_c33349ca47_o.jpg">
<p>
This national park is only accessible by car, you can also move around inside it only by car, there are no shuttles.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256750453_cc10b331b6_o.jpg">
<p>
From the entrance, drive about 5 kilometers to the most interesting part of the park; along the way, from time to time there are small paths several hundred meters deep.
<p/>

I was in the park before sunset, the light was already not enough, because of this I had to raise the ISO higher and adjust the settings in Lightroom so that the sand seemed as white as possible, and not blue.

<h2>Alamogordo</h2>
<p>
Alamogordo is the closest city to White Sands, population 35 thousand. I spent the night there in a motel, but there is nothing remarkable in this city. This is a typical American city along the highway: a main street with motels, gas stations and McDonald's, and a grid of streets around it. When you drive through the city, the view is a little different - you can see further, and the signs on both sides are clearly visible, but from the sidewalk it is not so visible.

Having filled the car with gasoline, I headed east along a relatively small highway through the mountains, since larger roads would have taken me 80 kilometers longer. The road immediately went up the serpentine and after a while I went from cool autumn to winter with snowdrifts.

I wanted to stop somewhere to take photos, and it turned out to be not so easy, because two or three extensions with observation platforms were completely covered with recently fallen snow - my car would simply drown there. I had to turn off the road somewhere to the side.

Further on, for more than 100 kilometers, the road goes through the desert in long, flat sections, visibility is far ahead, and the number of cars is close to zero. On the right is a sign “overtaking is allowed”: markings and signs are made carefully everywhere, overtaking is prohibited on uphills, then on downhills it is allowed.

In Artesia there is a turnoff to a major highway leading to Carlsbad. From here I drove non-stop all the way to the Carlsbad Caverns in order to arrive there before closing time.

<h2>Carlsbad Caverns</h2>
<p>
Carlsbad Cavern was long considered the largest cave in the world (until the discovery of larger ones in <a href="../borneo">Malaysia</a> and more recently in Vietnam). It was described in the book “One-Story America”; Ilf and Petrov were amazed at how well everything was equipped here, even with an elevator. The place is really remote, the nearest more or less large airport (El Paso) is 250 kilometers away. But I don't regret crossing all over New Mexico on the way here.
<p/>

<p>
You can go down on foot (an hour and a half along the stairs) or by elevator. I didn’t feel well - I had a cold the day before, and had spent five hours driving in the morning, so after drinking paracetamol, I went to the elevator.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256551921_4734ef99e1_o.jpg">
<p>
And here is the cave. The part open to the public is the “Great Hall” - the widest place, but in general the cave goes deeper and further down.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255824292_264bb580aa_o.jpg">

The path through the cave to the end of the large hall and back is 2-3 kilometers, it took me about an hour and a half to two hours.

<h2>Carlsbad</h2>
<p>
The closest city to Carlsbad Caverns is called Whites City. This is the smallest city in New Mexico - the population is only 7 people, so the name City is somewhat ironic. In "One-Story America" ​​it was written that the city was founded by Jim White, the discoverer of the cave, which would be logical to assume, but in fact it was founded by a certain Charlie White from Kentucky, who was just a namesake. Essentially White's City is a few buildings on both sides of the road, mostly very expensive hotels.

On the way back, I stopped for a walk in Carlsbad, which I had previously driven through in one swoop (there is no bypass road, the route goes through the city). The population of Carlsbad is only 26 thousand, that is, less than even Alamogordo, but the city seemed endless to me.

A few years ago, the city made the news because the only full-time member of the local police force was a police dog. The only police officer was suspended from service because it turned out that he owed several thousand in child support in the neighboring state of Texas. And then it turned out that he was also a corrupt official - he sold Vaughn’s old government-issued gun and took the money for himself.

On the way to Santa Fe, I decided to take a short detour and stop to see Pecos National Park. I left the highway near the town of Glorieta. There are already mountains with green forests around here. The Glorieta Church is visible in the distance.

The Rocky Mountains begin in northern New Mexico. To the east of Santa Fe is the Sangre de Cristo massif, to the north is the Jemez massif. In the same region there are many territories where Native Americans live. They have their own atmosphere and laws there. In the USA it is generally not customary to walk anywhere, every piece of land is fenced off and hung with the inscriptions “No Trespassing” and “No Loitering”, but the Indians went even further in this regard. In their villages, not only is it forbidden to take photographs (this is not surprising), but it is also forbidden to use a mobile phone (otherwise you might record the sound) and even... to draw. The only exception is the large community of Pojoaque, north of Santa Fe.

<h2>Santa Fe</h2>
<p>
The capital of New Mexico, Santa Fe is one of the most unusual cities in the United States. Let's start with the fact that it was founded in 1610 - it is the second oldest city in the States, after the small city of St. Augustine on the shores of Florida (and <a href="../puerto-rico">San Juan</ a>, if it is also considered as the USA).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256757463_1936d06c92_o.jpg">
<p>
The old part of Santa Fe is numbered from the central square, as in any Mexican city, which is not typical for American ones (usually the streets there are numbered from the river or sea). There is an obelisk in the center.

What’s interesting is that it’s not exactly a street grid; I had to pay close attention to the map to get the correct route.

When you get out of the residential area, you find yourself on a large street for cars with a high speed limit; along a network of such streets you can get to the center.

A couple of minutes' drive from Walter's house there is a plaza - it's not exactly a shopping center, but an area with a bunch of businesses.

It is easy to recognize the office of lawyer Saul Goodman in this place.

From here I went to the city center, it took about 30-40 minutes, since the city area is quite large. At some point, I was surprised to discover that the middle of the road along which I was traveling was a designated area for buses - a system of high-speed buses with separate stops had been organized here.

After crossing the railroad over a humpback bridge, I reached downtown Albuquerque. The city’s official website kindly posted a map of the center indicating where parking is and how much it costs, so I immediately knew that on the fourth street down it was free.

It’s as if it’s not really a downtown area anymore; it’s a residential area, not a business one. The downtown skyscrapers are visible in the distance; it takes about 15 minutes to walk there.

Opposite it is a rather remote place where meetings happened several times in the series (for example, at the end of season 3, when Walter shot down two hucksters who wanted to take revenge on Jesse).

The railway station is adjacent to it. Probably, before this was one single railway station, but now trains do not run here often. Although there is a new line all the way to Santa Fe with regular traffic.

Historically the main street of Albuquerque. The popular American Route 66 runs along it - the old road from Chicago to Los Angeles, which I have already seen <a href="../las-vegas">in Arizona</a>.

Albuquerque also has a historical center that does not coincide with the modern one. It is similar to Santa Fe and other colonial Spanish cities. There is a rectangular area in the center.
