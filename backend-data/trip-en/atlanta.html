<h1>USA: Niagara Falls, Buffalo, Cleveland, Savannah, Atlanta</h1>
<i>26-30 May 2018</i>
<h2>Niagara Falls</h2>
<p>
Niagara Falls are technically located mainly in the United States, but the view is from Canada. The American side is less popular and less developed - 99% of those who get here have no visa problems to enter Canada, so there is not much delay on this side. The American town has the same name as the Canadian one - Niagara Falls, and belongs to the state of New York (although it takes 9 hours to get to New York City, the state is large).

<p>
On the American side you can go out onto the island separating the two waterfalls, but the view here is from a close angle and there is no panoramic view.

You can also look at the river from above.

And to the Canadian shore.

The second waterfall is also viewed from the side.

<p>
In the distance is the border bridge. You can also see a tower that protrudes forward compared to the shore - in theory, there should be a good view of the waterfall from it, but you can only get there on the way to the ship boarding point.

Also on the shore there is a monument to the legendary physicist Nikola Tesla, who conducted experiments in Niagara.

American Niagara Falls is small and modest, although there is also half a street with souvenirs.

Passage back to Canada. Like other borders in North America, there is no passport control at the exit, only a one-way gate. By the way, on the Canadian side of the border there is a turnstile into which you need to insert 1 dollar in 25-cent coins (both Canadian and American are accepted).
<p/>

<h2>Buffalo</h2>
<p>
The closest major city to Niagara Falls on the US side is Buffalo (or Buffalo), a typical “rust belt” city that was once industrial, then became crime-ridden, and is now gradually being restored. A business center with classic skyscrapers remains here from the golden era.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257018060_e39f3d2cbf_o.jpg">
<p>
About 15 years ago, Buffalo was full of apocalyptic landscapes, but now it’s pretty decent.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255245007_6654afd324_o.jpg">
<p>
Apocalypticism manifests itself in a typically American way in the fact that on Sunday it’s empty on the central streets.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256723654_769a8d9d63_o.jpg">
<p>
The tram stop is large and completely empty.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257017885_0c170bed3a_o.jpg">
<p>
Trams, however, run. Behind is a beautiful bank building.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255974581_773a7d658b_o.jpg">
<p>
The line was designed and built in the 70s - 80s, when the city's population was falling sharply (in general, it had halved since 1950), because of this there were fewer passengers than necessary, and the tram was not extended much further than the city center, such plans were announced only in recent years.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255245257_9520c69aaf_o.jpg">
<p>
And this is where everyone who came to take a walk in the center on Sunday gathered - on that day there was a marathon.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257018030_9c40b52beb_o.jpg">
<p>
Car traffic was blocked on several central streets.

<h2>Cleveland</h2>
<p>
Cleveland, Ohio is one of the cities in the Midwest that has experienced severe decline. It was once one of the ten largest cities in the United States, but now it barely makes it into the top 50. At its peak, the population was more than 900 thousand, and now it is less than 400.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256227588_b8e230d68f_o.jpg">
<p>
On Sunday afternoon, you can film a movie about a zombie apocalypse in the city center.
<p/>

Now the city looks decent at first glance, although the crime level here is one of the highest in America.

The word "rock and roll" was coined by Cleveland radio DJ Alan Freed.

<h2>Savannah</h2>
<p>
Savannah is one of the oldest and most beautiful cities in the USA; tourists come here to look at the city of the 18-19th century, which is perfectly preserved here. The city is small and not a capital city, so there are no skyscrapers or other later buildings here, everything has been preserved as it was.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256515425_f8a879eac1_o.jpg">
<p>
The famous movie "Forrest Gump" was filmed in Savannah - the part where the main character sits on a bench. This is the place, but there is no bench here - it was placed facing the road only for filming, approximately where the Chippewa square sign is.
<p/>

Like other American cities, Savannah is laid out on a grid. Large squares are equipped every few blocks.

It is believed that there are no ancient cities in the USA, but here is Savannah from the 18th and 19th centuries, this is comparable to most European cities that we can see now.

Savannah is incredibly touristy and the city is small.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256514570_a244e248c9_o.jpg">
<p>
Because of this, housing in the city center is simply astronomically expensive, like in Manhattan or even worse. If you want cheaper than $100, even airbnb is not close to the center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255470616_f7efb30c57_o.jpg">
<p>
At the same time, public transport here is also bad - the city is small. For example, there is a bus from the airport three times a day, so I was forced to take a taxi. Bus is inexpensive - $3 per day or $50 per month.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254739462_a063d0b88f_o.jpg">
<p>
Because of this, I spent the first night in a real motel on the highway on the outskirts of town. It was also not cheap - about $70, but there were simply no better options. Along the road there are motels, McDonald's, pharmacies and all sorts of shops, with large gaps between parking lots.

<h2>Atlanta</h2>
<p>
Atlanta is the main city in the southern United States. According to statistics, about half of Atlanta is white, but if you walk around the center, it seems like 0%, because white people can only be seen at the entrance to the Coca-Cola Museum. It’s an unusual feeling, because you seem to be in Africa, but there’s civilization all around. The business center looks solid at first glance.

From the inside, the shops in this area look like they were in Russia in the 90s. At night, I also watched local gopniks at a gas station trying to drift in old cars. In general, the place is colorful.

Atlanta has two subway lines. I would even say that this is something between a metro and a suburban train, because the distances between neighboring stations are huge.

There's an advertisement for a law firm in the subway. It is ironic that in America, a lawyer is almost the highest paid profession, whose representatives can afford to buy advertising in the subway. And in Russia this is the most shameful low-paid profession that no one needs.

Atlanta still has the world's first airport in terms of passenger traffic (but Beijing and Istanbul are approaching with new airports). I remember it because I stood there for the longest time at security control - almost an hour (I had never stood anywhere for more than 15 minutes before), because there were clearly not enough scanners for such a crowd.

Oh, how long have I been hunting for this supermarket! Walmart is supposedly the largest supermarket chain in the United States, but in each of at least two dozen cities where I had been before, they were in such a remote place that it was impossible to get there. In New York and San Francisco, for example, there is no Walmart within the city limits, only in neighboring cities. In other cities they exist, but they are always far from the center. And finally, in Atlanta, Walmart is only two or three stops away on the subway.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256884505_e367e2dbf2_o.jpg">
<p>
In general, Walmart resembles a suburban "Auchan" or "Lenta" in St. Petersburg near the Baltic Station - a hangar-like room, huge rows, a huge number of identical product names displayed on the shelves at the same time.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256043133_3664dc34d4_o.jpg">
<p>
Some shelves, where there are especially many goods of one brand, are reminiscent of Indian supermarkets with their “Soviet” variety. In general, the selection of goods for such a large store is modest; some quite ordinary categories are not available at all: for example, seafood and mushrooms. Half of the hall is occupied by non-food products (which also makes Walmart and Auchan similar), but I won’t review them.

Go! First vegetables and fruits. Let me remind you that prices in America are indicated not per kilogram, but per pound (450 grams), that is, the price tag can be safely multiplied by two. Also, a small tax (6-8%) is usually added on top, but not for all goods. Small tomatoes cost $1.28 - 3 dollars per kilo, like in Russia in winter.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256043513_613eeeb3b1_o.jpg">
