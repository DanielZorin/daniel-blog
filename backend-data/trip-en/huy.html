<h2>Liege</h2>
<p>
Last time (2012), I thought of Belgium as the most unpleasant country in Europe. That time I was mainly in the rich and touristy Flanders, this time in the less popular Wallonia, where they speak French. This photo shows almost the center of Liege.
<p/>

<p>
Wallonia is considered a poor region by Belgian standards, full of closed factories and dirty working-class areas.
<p/>

Skyscrapers in the style of Soviet research institutes.

The weather added to the impressions.

<p>
According to an old Belgian tradition, there are bags of garbage on the streets.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257401095_a7b949ee95_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It also has its own historical center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257400795_f83caf4227_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Wallonia looks like a mix of France and Holland/Flanders. The houses look like French ones, but are narrow, like Dutch ones.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255628902_f2531ac080_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There's something German visible there.

Brown and dark red colors predominate.
<p/>

<p>
There are a couple of grandiose buildings a la Brussels.

<p>
In Belgium, as in France, there is a noticeable increase in security measures. Police in blue berets with machine guns walk the streets.
<p/>

<p>
From the Liege zone we go to the Huy zone!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257401185_ce1e00941d_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Huy</h2>
<p>
And here I am standing in the very city where people in Russia are often sent to travel. (<i>In Russian, "Huy" is the most common curse word, meaning literally "penis/dick". "Fuck off" in Russian literally sounds like "Go on a dick"</i>)
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256399453_7d362c9eff_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In French the city is called Huy, in Dutch it is called Hoei. What do the city of Huy and Ukraine have in common? And there and there they go not to, but on. (<i>There is a big debate which preposition to use with the name of Ukraine in Russian language</i>)
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256398963_d2cef4ca2a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The name of the city is at every step here, not only on the station building.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257242600_6133b4424e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But also on each personal index.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256199826_6c34300db6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In Belgium, it is still customary to emboss the name of the architect and his city on the wall of a building.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257242645_03259c5cac_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The city consists of two parts, separated by a river. The station is in the newer part, and the old center is across the river. The new part looks good too.

In the old part there is a large castle on a hill.

I inform everyone who is worried about the fate of Europe: in Huy I also saw immigrants, but, unlike Brussels, there are few of them.
<p/>

This is a very pleasant and neat town.

<h2>Namur</h2>
<p>
I had very little time to explore this city.

Very cheap copy center - 40 sheets for 1 euro. Unexpected for such an expensive country as Belgium. In Russia you are unlikely to find cheaper than 20 sheets per euro.

<h2>Brussels</h2>
<p>
Compared to <a href="../belgium">last time</a> I liked Brussels much more.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256166548_ac888f2727_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are still bags of garbage lying along the streets here, but this time I saw them being removed.
<p/>

<p>
Everything is expensive in Belgium, food is twice as expensive as in neighboring Germany. Hotels are also expensive, but airbnb is better - for $30 I rented a small studio apartment not far from the notorious northern train station. Formally, this is not Brussels, but a suburb of Saint-Jos-Ten-Noode, judging by the sign.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256166288_450aa8dfc6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
White people in Brussels clearly do not live in the areas where I have been. In the center and north there are only tourists from other European countries. However, the Saint-Jos-Ten-Noode area looks quite decent, not dirty.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256714754_4fc598bdf5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It turns out that there are two super avenues in Brussels, one running from west to east north of the historical center, the second from north to south east of the center. They intersect at right angles, and in the distance on each one you can see a huge church with a dome. Last time I was just living near that church that is visible in the distance.
<p/>

Some of the streets in the center have been dug up. Every time I'm in Belgium I come across this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256166378_9dcbb004db_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I went to the city center. Everything is fine on the Grand Place, there are a lot of tourists.

The large number 1 is immediately visible, but the small number 5 is not visible. And for 1.5 euros you can only buy an empty waffle without filling. It's better to eat waffles in Poland, it's cheaper there.
<p/>

<h2>Charleroi</h2>
<p>
I flew from Brussels early in the morning through Charleroi airport - one of the main Ryanair hubs. The price of a bus to the airport is high - 17 euros, although the ride is no more than an hour. An alternative is to get to the city of Charleroi for 10 euros, and from there for 5 euros on a local bus. Not so much savings. There were no Blablacars, so I came up with a plan to travel for 7 euros to the Courcelles train station, from where, judging by the map, it was a 4-kilometer walk to the airport.
The first failure occurred when the train passed Courcelles without stopping, although the timetables on the Belgian railway website and in the ticket machine stated that there would be a stop. I had to get off at the Charleroi train station, from where the airport was not 4, but at least 8 kilometers away. However, there was more than enough time to spend 2 hours on the hike.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257050415_ca039abf06_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Charleroi used to be the poorest and most depressive city in Belgium, but now this is not noticeable, it's like any other city.

<p>
The second failure was that this airport is not designed for pedestrians at all. Around the terminal there is a huge labyrinth of parking lots surrounded by high fences. As a result, we had to make a giant detour around the entire airport to the entrance for cars.
<p/>

Inside the terminal is an interesting sight. Sleeping people lie along all the walls, and soldiers with machine guns at the ready slowly walk along the corridors.

This is not a concentration camp, no. It’s just that, apparently, many people don’t want to pay for an extra night in a hotel in Brussels.
