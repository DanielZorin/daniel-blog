<h1>Netherlands: Eindhoven, 's-Hertogenbosch, Utrecht, Amsterdam</h1>
<i>1-4 February 2019</i>
<h2>Eindhoven</h2>
<p>
When Pobeda opened flights to the Netherlands, I flew there for the weekend. Low-cost flights land at Eindhoven Airport in the southern part of the country, from where you can get to Amsterdam in an hour.

<h2>'s-Hertogenbosch</h2>
<p>
You can’t help but visit this city purely because of the name - it’s the only city that begins with an apostrophe and a small letter. It is pronounced [sertohenbos], but in spoken language it is usually called as Den Bosch.

Pineapple house. In the Netherlands, they generally don’t worry about closing curtains on the first floors, even on central streets where there are no courtyards in front of the house. It’s somehow even awkward to pass by when everything is visible right through.

<h2>Utrecht</h2>
<p>
Utrecht is a large city in the Netherlands (fourth after Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague) half an hour's drive south of the capital. A city with many canals and a large university.
<p/>

<p>
The main feature of Utrecht is the two-level local canals. The technical floor beside the water used to be occupied by warehouses, but now they open cafes there, just like above.

<h2>Amsterdam</h2>
<p>
I was in Amsterdam quite a long time ago, in <a href="http://goo.gl/xL6f98">2012</a>. It was definitely worth visiting one of the most iconic cities in Europe again.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255815886_cc5107ab30_o.jpg">
<p>
As you know, Amsterdam is one of the most expensive cities in Europe for tourists due to expensive housing. Even hostels here are obscenely expensive, since there is a very high flow of young people here for obvious reasons. In principle, airbnb works in Amsterdam, but it is expensive, or sold out quickly. It is prohibited to rent out entire apartments for more than 60 days a year, but there are also few individual rooms. But a solution was found - you can live in the neighboring city of Amstelveen, which is located immediately south of the administrative border of Amsterdam, and where the metro line leads. On the metro, unlimited pass for two days costs 13.50 euros, for three - 19 euro.
<p/>

Amstelveen is a residential area with mostly low-rise buildings and its own canals.

There are a lot of tourists in the center of Amsterdam, it is one of the most crowded cities in the world. Basically, everyone is concentrated in the red light district, where there are also souvenir shops and a number of coffee shops. The further you go from there, the quieter and more deserted the streets become.

I visited the Albina restaurant - this is a very budget establishment in Amsterdam, where they serve mainly Surinamese food. Suriname is a country in South America that was formerly a colony of the Netherlands and where Dutch is still spoken. Their food is a mixture of Caribbean and Indonesia (also a Dutch colony from where many people moved to Suriname).

Night Amsterdam. Apart from the red light district, everything is very quiet and meditative.
