<h1>Russia: Korolev</h1>
<i>August 1999</i>
<p>
This was my first trip without my parents - I went to a children's chess tournament with other players and a coach in Korolev. This is a city just a couple of kilometers from the borders of Moscow (so, in principle, I could probably go there every day from home), but I didn’t know it then, and for me it was an epic journey - I had to go somewhere by train!
