<h1>Indonesia: Medan, Lake Toba, Bukittinggi, Padang, Jakarta</h1>
<i>18-29 April 2016</i>
<h2>Medan</h2>
<p>
Indonesia is the largest country in Southeast Asia. In 2011, I was on the main island of Java (by the way, many of the features there are typical for the whole country), and now it’s time to visit the other islands. The closest island to Malaysia is Sumatra. Large, but less densely populated than Java and with fairly poor roads. Typically, trips to Sumatra begin from the city of Medan, the largest on this island.

<p>
Here you can immediately immerse yourself in the atmosphere of Indonesia. The most vivid impression is that all passers-by shout “Hello!” to you, especially in large cities where tourists do not stay for long.

Indonesians are very fond of fences and do not hesitate to string exposed barbed wire. If you hurt yourself, it’s your own fault.

Smoking is a big problem in Indonesia. If you look at the statistics, it turns out that in Russia and Eastern Europe people smoke more on average, and Western Europe is not far behind. But have you seen at least one person smoking anywhere in Germany? But they exist, you just can’t smoke in public places, everyone smokes at home or in special secluded areas. In Indonesia, the opposite is true. If in Russia people sit indoors without cigarettes and go outside, into the courtyard or on the stairs to smoke, then Indonesians will smoke in the room and go outside to get some fresh air. Here it is considered normal to smoke in cars and buses. In Europe, the price of cigarettes is increased through excise taxes; in Indonesia, the government reduces taxes for tobacco companies. Smoking in Indonesia is stylish, fashionable, youthful, and not to say cheap: local kretek cigarettes (with a clove flavor) cost 2,000 rupees apiece ($0.15 or 10 rubles). Social advertising does not lie - it is easy to spend a large part of your salary on cigarettes. By the way, in Indonesia almost exclusively men smoke, while in Europe the proportion of smokers among women and men is approximately equal.

Although Indonesia was a colony of the Netherlands, all cities here have clock towers at the central crossroads, just like in the English colonies.

Indonesia is rising from its knees: giant shopping centers are springing up in the middle of the city, just like in Thailand and Malaysia.

There was no Soviet system in Indonesia; mass repressions were carried out against communists in the 1960s. But instead of communism, a kind of local fascism, with garudas and axes, ruled the country for thirty years. In 1998, the regime was overthrown, but all over the country there are still concrete steles with the garuda bird and the five principles of Pancasila, like monuments to Lenin, signs with cheerful workers, and monuments to the great tribal leaders of a thousand years ago.

There will definitely be a large wasteland somewhere in the city center with crumbling monuments.

The only attraction of Medan is the Maimun Palace.

<p>
Due to its large size and distances, Indonesia has never been a particularly unified state; even the most powerful states could hardly fully control the outlying islands. Even under the Dutch, there were actually many colonial sultanate states. Medan was the capital of one of these states - the Deli Sultanate. After the declaration of independence of Indonesia, all sultanates were abolished (except one - Yogyakarta), and the property of the nobles was mostly taken away. But now their families are alive and have significant influence in the region. In the palace, which is now like a museum, there are photographs of all the sultans, including the current very young one, who has ruled since 2005.

Medan, of course, is not a very nice city with dirty air and poor transport. But there is also a plus - decent establishments have already appeared here, but their prices have not yet risen. You can go to a very posh restaurant with white tablecloths and eat a steak for $5.
<p/>

On the way to the hotel, I noticed a cool street chef: the cooks and waiters approached the matter with imagination, and received a strong flow of visitors.

<h2>Lake Toba</h2>
<p>
Just five hours on a hot, stuffy, smoky bus from Medan, and you find yourself almost in heaven. Cool breeze, fresh water, mountains. Lake Toba is the crater of a giant volcano, and in the middle of it is a peninsula-almost-island of Samosir.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255605132_24195c374e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a ferry from the shore closest to Medan.

<p>
The area around the village of Tuk-Tuk is a resort on the lake. The hotels here are abnormally cheap - single rooms can even cost 25 thousand rupees ($2)! I settled for 100k in a luxurious place on the lake with a hot shower. Air conditioning is not necessary here.

You don't have to go far for food - there is a restaurant right there in the hotel. These three huge pieces of fish cost less than $3.

<p>
Magic mushrooms are openly sold everywhere in the village. By the way, it seems that in Indonesia there is a death penalty for drugs.

The population of this region, the Bataks, are mostly Christians, not Muslims like most Indonesians. Instead of mosques there are churches.

The roads are mostly decent, but the secondary roads are not so good.

There are graves along the roads here. The graves are shaped like castles with towers or mini-houses.

In Indonesia, in addition to traditional instant noodles (which is used here as a regular ingredient), there is another instant package - “Super-bubur”. This is a thick porridge, very tasty.

<h2>Padang</h2>
<p>
It's been a while since I got my feet wet in the Indian Ocean. Apart from any straits, then since 2011 - last time in <a href="../indonesia-2">Indonesia</a>. A second chance came on the southwest coast of Sumatra.
<p/>

Yes, the beach in the city of Padang is not conducive to swimming.

KFC and local competitor CFC are in the same building. CFC is not bad; among fast food in Indonesia, the only good price for fast food is McDonald's - to diversify the diet, so to speak.

It looks like they are building a bus system with dedicated lanes like in Jakarta, but I haven't seen them yet, just stops. There are only buses to the airport once an hour.

The Indonesian society supports traditional conservative values: adultery, gambling, drugs, alcohol, corruption, manipulation and, of course, LGBT people are not tolerated here. The military men and the city mayor guarantee. Traditional values, however, do not prevent Indonesians from smoking on buses, taking bribes and littering.

<h2>Jakarta</h2>
<p>
Jakarta is a special city for me: it was the first city in Southeast Asia that I visited back in <a href="../indonesia-1">2011</a>. Before this, I was in Asia in Beijing, but China is a high civilization, and Indonesia then greatly impressed me. And now, five years later, I am back in Jakarta. What has changed during this time?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255494127_030a45d320_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I'm coming from the airport by bus. Almost the entire road to Gambir station is on overpasses, there are no traffic jams. There is a fantastic picture all around - skyscrapers and huge residential complexes are being built everywhere. It seems that you are in China.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257266215_5cbad2dced_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Judging by the architecture, the Chinese are actively involved in the new construction of Jakarta.

<p>
Having checked in on Jaksa Street (there are cheap hotels there), I went for a walk in familiar places. Here is Gambir railway station. In 2011, at this very place, I saw people riding on the roof of a train. Now Indonesian railways have changed a lot, even the cheapest cars have air conditioning, power sockets, and all seats are fixed.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257266325_b761840576_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Went to the good old slums. Here is the entrance, the stele has not changed.
<p/>

Let's continue to walk around the renewed Jakarta. Last time I made an unfortunate omission - I didn’t climb to the top of the National Monument, I was afraid of the line. This time it's time to fix it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256423903_b027cf53ee_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here it is, the National Monument. The queue to go up is actually small, at least on a weekday.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256423963_8b0ba93bb1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Around the monument are bas-reliefs describing the history of Indonesia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256972854_b647aed459_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Then you need to go down under the monument. There is a museum there where the history of the country is illustrated with miniature compositions. Here western Irian joins Indonesia.
<p/>

<p>
The captions present the official view of history. Thus, the events of 1965 are called the “Attempt of a communist coup”, it is modestly said that “Movement was destroyed”, and not that millions of people were killed throughout the country without any trial.
<p/>

Indonesia was forced to annex East Timor, because the people there asked. There is no sign about the independence of East Timor.
