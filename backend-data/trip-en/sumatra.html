<h1>Indonesia: Medan, Lake Toba, Bukittinggi, Padang, Jakarta</h1>
<i>18-29 April 2016</i>
<h2>Medan</h2>
<p>
Indonesia is the largest country in Southeast Asia. In 2011, I was on the main island of Java (by the way, many of the features there are typical for the whole country), and now it’s time to visit the other islands. The closest island to Malaysia is Sumatra. Large, but less densely populated than Java and with fairly poor roads. Typically, trips to Sumatra begin from the city of Medan, the largest on this island.

<p>
Here you can immediately immerse yourself in the atmosphere of Indonesia. The most vivid impression is that all passers-by shout “Hello!” to you, especially in large cities where tourists do not stay for long.

Indonesians are very fond of fences and do not hesitate to string exposed barbed wire. If you hurt yourself, it’s your own fault.

Smoking is a big problem in Indonesia. If you look at the statistics, it turns out that in Russia and Eastern Europe people smoke more on average, and Western Europe is not far behind. But have you seen at least one person smoking anywhere in Germany? But they exist, you just can’t smoke in public places, everyone smokes at home or in special secluded areas. In Indonesia, the opposite is true. If in Russia people sit indoors without cigarettes and go outside, into the courtyard or on the stairs to smoke, then Indonesians will smoke in the room and go outside to get some fresh air. Here it is considered normal to smoke in cars and buses. In Europe, the price of cigarettes is increased through excise taxes; in Indonesia, the government reduces taxes for tobacco companies. Smoking in Indonesia is stylish, fashionable, youthful, and not to say cheap: local kretek cigarettes (with a clove flavor) cost 2,000 rupees apiece ($0.15 or 10 rubles). Social advertising does not lie - it is easy to spend a large part of your salary on cigarettes. By the way, in Indonesia almost exclusively men smoke, while in Europe the proportion of smokers among women and men is approximately equal.

Although Indonesia was a colony of the Netherlands, all cities here have clock towers at the central crossroads, just like in the English colonies.

There was no Soviet system in Indonesia; mass repressions were carried out against communists in the 1960s. But instead of communism, a kind of local fascism, with garudas and axes, ruled the country for thirty years. In 1998, the regime was overthrown, but all over the country there are still concrete steles with the garuda bird and the five principles of Pancasila, like monuments to Lenin, signs with cheerful workers, and monuments to the great tribal leaders of a thousand years ago.

Due to its large size and distances, Indonesia has never been a particularly unified state; even the most powerful states could hardly fully control the outlying islands. Even under the Dutch, there were actually many colonial sultanate states. Medan was the capital of one of these states - the Deli Sultanate. After the declaration of independence of Indonesia, all sultanates were abolished (except one - Yogyakarta), and the property of the nobles was mostly taken away. But now their families are alive and have significant influence in the region. In the palace, which is now like a museum, there are photographs of all the sultans, including the current very young one, who has ruled since 2005.

Medan, of course, is not a very nice city with dirty air and poor transport. But there is also a plus - decent establishments have already appeared here, but their prices have not yet risen. You can go to a very posh restaurant with white tablecloths and eat a steak for $5.

On the way to the hotel, I noticed a cool street chef: the cooks and waiters approached the matter with imagination, and received a strong flow of visitors.

<h2>Lake Toba</h2>
<p>
Just five hours on a hot, stuffy, smoky bus from Medan, and you find yourself almost in heaven. Cool breeze, fresh water, mountains. Lake Toba is the crater of a giant volcano, and in the middle of it is a peninsula-almost-island of Samosir.

The area around the village of Tuk-Tuk is a resort on the lake. The hotels here are abnormally cheap - single rooms can even cost 25 thousand rupees ($2)! I settled for 100k in a luxurious place on the lake with a hot shower. Air conditioning is not necessary here.

The population of this region, the Bataks, are mostly Christians, not Muslims like most Indonesians. Instead of mosques there are churches.

In Indonesia, in addition to traditional instant noodles (which is used here as a regular ingredient), there is another instant package - “Super-bubur”. This is a thick porridge, very tasty.

<h2>Padang</h2>
<p>
It's been a while since I got my feet wet in the Indian Ocean. Apart from any straits, then since 2011 - last time in <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/228671.html">Indonesia</a>. A second chance came on the southwest coast of Sumatra.

The Indonesian society supports traditional conservative values: adultery, gambling, drugs, alcohol, corruption, manipulation and, of course, LGBT people are not tolerated here. The military men and the city mayor guarantee. Traditional values, however, do not prevent Indonesians from smoking on buses, taking bribes and littering.

<h2>Jakarta</h2>
<p>
Jakarta is a special city for me: it was the first city in Southeast Asia that I visited back in <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/227757.html">2011</a>. Before this, I was in Asia in Beijing, but China is a high civilization, and Indonesia then greatly impressed me. And now, five years later, I am back in Jakarta. What has changed during this time?

Having checked in on Jaksa Street (there are cheap hotels there), I went for a walk in familiar places. Here is Gambir railway station. In 2011, at this very place, I saw people riding on the roof of a train. Now Indonesian railways have changed a lot, even the cheapest cars have air conditioning, power sockets, and all seats are fixed.
