<h2>Krasnogorsk</h2>
<p>
I lived in Krasnogorsk for more than a year, from August 2017 to October 2018. Although at first glance it is a residential suburb of Moscow, starting immediately when crossing the Moscow Ring Road in the northwestern direction, I perceive Krasnogorsk as a separate city. While living there, I noticed that I began to say “to the city” to mean “to the center of Moscow.” Now there are MCD trains running to Krasnogorsk, but back then they were ordinary trains with a treacherous break from about 11 to 13, the ride from Krasnogorskaya station to Tushino station was 12 minutes and the ticket cost 22 rubles. House where I lived:

<p>
There are still a number of private houses and plots around it. Contrast:

We once bought an excellent kitchen set on Avito, 5 times cheaper than the nominal value, but it was impossible to put it in the new apartment - there was nowhere else, so it temporarily took up half the room.

The view from the balcony always pleased me, it is so triangular and photogenic. Autumn - October 14, 2017.

The neighboring house made it a little difficult to look in the other direction; behind it was the Ivanovsky Ponds park - the nicest park in Krasnogorsk.

<p>
Ivanovo Ponds are two ponds, excellent promenades, places for fishing and houses for ducks, and a little further from the pond there are wild ravines.

That winter, one day the snow fell so much that it covered the tree branches with a thick layer, resulting in incredible beauty.

<p>
Of course, I not only went to the store and the station, but also from time to time explored Krasnogorsk, visiting different areas of this city. Krasnogorsk officially became a city in 1940; before that, there were several small villages on its territory, and the noble estate Znamenskoye-Gubailovo, the buildings of which have been preserved since the 18th century.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257045009_a5d8ec663d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are several more outbuildings.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257043789_3f2346d3ba_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The Znamenskaya (Annunciation) Church was also located near the estate. Now they are located right on the main road.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257043824_645b44d196_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Behind the estate is now the Krasnogorsk city park.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255567817_9f515b2e37_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are also ponds with ducks here.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256298151_062f5a92dd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also a monument to Lenin in the park, pointing somewhere back.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255567797_b9393a5340_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Literally nearby on the square there is another one - probably the main monument to Lenin in Krasnogorsk.
<p/>

<p>
If you go further north, after a while you can get to the Mitino metro station - theoretically, it was 4 kilometers on foot from my house to it, but I only went there once out of curiosity.

<p>
Judging by the map, at this intersection there is the border of Moscow and the Moscow region. There are no signs, but the road to the left goes through the territory of Moscow, the road to the right - exactly along the border - I am standing in the region and the lawn on the right is all in the region, and the fence in the center is in Moscow.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255567907_7649af10fc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A little to the west of the Znamenskoye estate is the Podmoskovye cultural center and the square in front of it - perhaps in size this is the main square of Krasnogorsk, although less important than the square with Lenin.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257340170_10f0e866ac_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Behind it there is a children's park.

Further east there are a couple of large shopping centers, a large interchange, after which Moscow formally begins. I haven't explored this part of the city much. So now let’s see what we have in the south of Ivanovskie Ponds and my house.
<p/>

There is a bust of Lenin near the kindergarten - I discovered it by accident, since this monument is not in the leninstatues.ru database.

<p>
Someone is fishing. The river here is very wide, forms a large bay on the border with the Moscow Ring Road.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256297861_04e32ae89b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I climbed up to it and looked into the distance - this is formally Moscow, an enclave outside the Moscow Ring Road.
<p/>

<p>
Suddenly a garage town appeared on the right. It looks like people live here; someone installed plastic windows in the garage. Such a phenomenon is now rarely seen in Moscow, but once upon a time, not long ago, not far from the University metro station there was a whole gigantic city of such favelas.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255567632_42bad59470_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Finally, the opportunity arose to turn right off the highway, and there was a sign indicating the entrance to Moscow. There I looked around this area (Rublevo), took a bus to the Kuntsevskaya metro station, from there to Mitino and took a minibus to home.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255567677_c6a7a39fc3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is one more area in Krasnogorsk that cannot be ignored, and where I went by train - this is the area around the Pavshino station and Pavshinskaya floodplain. These places are clearly visible from the train whenever you pass by.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256296931_8400ba1b26_h.jpg"/>
<p>
They have been building an interchange here for many years, which should reduce traffic jams from those wishing to get out of Krasnogorsk by car, but there are only more traffic jams.

And here it is - Pavshinskaya floodplain. This is the most densely built-up and high-rise district of Krasnogorsk.

Why is not difficult to understand. The Myakinino metro station is within walking distance. Behind the pedestrian bridge.

Behind the bridge is also the territory of the Moscow region. There is the famous Crocus City complex. Myakinino is the only Moscow metro station not located in Moscow. Two more stations (Kotelniki and Novokosino) are located on the borders, with part of their exits outside the city limits.

<h2>Dedovsk</h2>
<p>
One fine winter day, walking around Krasnogorsk, I took the train in the direction from Moscow and rode a couple of stops to the next city called Dedovsk (in fact, before Dedovsk there is also the city of Nakhabino, but it doesn't sound that cool).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257095770_fa0c769d8e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Dedovsk turned out to be a rather small town. There is no full-fledged station here, but near the platform it is busy, there is a Burger King.
<p/>

<p>
The parks and alleys were beautiful thanks to the snow that had fallen.
<p/>

<p>
Even the architecture looked nobler against this background.

<h2>Reutov</h2>
<p>
The city of Reutov adjoins Moscow from the east. Novokosino metro station is located on the border of Reutov and Moscow, half of the exits are on one side, half on the other.
<p/>

<h2>Istra</h2>
<p>
The city of Istra is located about an hour away from Moscow by train. Most people come here to see the nearby New Jerusalem Monastery. To begin with, I got off at the Istra station and walked from there to the monastery through the entire city center.

<h2>Serpukhov</h2>
<p>
Serpukhov is a historical city in the very south of the Moscow region, it takes two hours to get there from Moscow, and exactly three hours from Krasnogorsk, which is curious, I arrived without transfers, passing right through the whole of Moscow.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254756227_384b5a16b6_h.jpg"/>

What's important about it? It’s just that this is the very first monument to Lenin. Opened in January 1924, coincidentally the same day Lenin died.
