<h2>Krasnogorsk</h2>
<p>
I lived in Krasnogorsk for more than a year, from August 2017 to October 2018. Although at first glance it is a residential suburb of Moscow, starting immediately when crossing the Moscow Ring Road in the northwestern direction, I perceive Krasnogorsk as a separate city. While living there, I noticed that I began to say “to the city” to mean “to the center of Moscow.” Now there are MCD trains running to Krasnogorsk, but back then they were ordinary trains with a treacherous break from about 11 to 13, the ride from Krasnogorskaya station to Tushino station was 12 minutes and the ticket cost 22 rubles. House where I lived:

We once bought an excellent kitchen set on Avito, 5 times cheaper than the nominal value, but it was impossible to put it in the new apartment - there was nowhere else, so it temporarily took up half the room.

The neighboring house made it a little difficult to look in the other direction; behind it was the Ivanovsky Ponds park - the nicest park in Krasnogorsk.

Ivanovo Ponds are two ponds, excellent promenades, places for fishing and houses for ducks, and a little further from the pond there are wild ravines.

Of course, I not only went to the store and the station, but also from time to time explored Krasnogorsk, visiting different areas of this city. Krasnogorsk officially became a city in 1940; before that, there were several small villages on its territory, and the noble estate Znamenskoye-Gubailovo, the buildings of which have been preserved since the 18th century.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257045009_4be78d9de0_o.jpg">
<p>
There are several more outbuildings.

The Znamenskaya (Annunciation) Church was also located near the estate. Now they are located right on the main road.

Literally nearby on the square there is another one - probably the main monument to Lenin in Krasnogorsk.

If you go further north, after a while you can get to the Mitino metro station - theoretically, it was 4 kilometers on foot from my house to it, but I only went there once out of curiosity.

Judging by the map, at this intersection there is the border of Moscow and the Moscow region. There are no signs, but the road to the left goes through the territory of Moscow, the road to the right - exactly along the border - I am standing in the region and the lawn on the right is all in the region, and the fence in the center is in Moscow.

A little to the west of the Znamenskoye estate is the Podmoskovye cultural center and the square in front of it - perhaps in size this is the main square of Krasnogorsk, although less important than the square with Lenin.

Suddenly a garage town appeared on the right. It looks like people live here; someone installed plastic windows in the garage. Such a phenomenon is now rarely seen in Moscow, but once upon a time, not long ago, not far from the University metro station there was a whole gigantic city of such favelas.

Finally, the opportunity arose to turn right off the highway, and there was a sign indicating the entrance to Moscow. There I looked around this area (Rublevo), took a bus to the Kuntsevskaya metro station, from there to Mitino and took a minibus to home.

They have been building an interchange here for many years, which should reduce traffic jams from those wishing to get out of Krasnogorsk by car, but there are only more traffic jams.

<h2>Dedovsk</h2>
<p>
One fine winter day, walking around Krasnogorsk, I took the train in the direction from Moscow and rode a couple of stops to the next city called Dedovsk (in fact, before Dedovsk there is also the city of Nakhabino, but it doesn't sound that cool).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257095770_57f23ea593_o.jpg">
<p>
Dedovsk turned out to be a rather small town. There is no full-fledged station here, but near the platform it is busy, there is a Burger King.

<h2>Reutov</h2>
<p>
The city of Reutov adjoins Moscow from the east. Novokosino metro station is located on the border of Reutov and Moscow, half of the exits are on one side, half on the other.

The city of Istra is located about an hour away from Moscow by train. Most people come here to see the nearby New Jerusalem Monastery. To begin with, I got off at the Istra station and walked from there to the monastery through the entire city center.

<h2>Serpukhov</h2>
<p>
Serpukhov is a historical city in the very south of the Moscow region, it takes two hours to get there from Moscow, and exactly three hours from Krasnogorsk, which is curious, I arrived without transfers, passing right through the whole of Moscow.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254756227_37e4634c5a_o.jpg">

<p>

Noginsk is one of the old cities of the Moscow region. Before the revolution it was called Bogorodsk, of course, the Bolsheviks could not leave that name. There is a full-fledged small historical center with a pedestrian street.

What's important about it? It’s just that this is the very first monument to Lenin. Opened in January 1924, coincidentally the same day Lenin died.

More precisely, the first of those that have survived to this day. There is information that busts of Lenin were placed in public places before 1924, but they were short-lived. The first monument to Lenin in St. Petersburg <a href="../vyborg">was erected in 1926</a>.
