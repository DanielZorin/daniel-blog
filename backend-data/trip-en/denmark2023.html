<h1>Denmark: Billund, Vejle, Aalborg, Aarhus, Odense, Copenhagen</h1>
<i>10-12 December 2023</i>
<h2>Billund</h2>
<p>
I flew back home from Spain through Denmark - a country where I had only been once before, more than 10 years ago. I was only on the capital island of Zealand, but this time I flew to the mainland of Denmark - the Jutland Peninsula. The airport in the small town of Billund serves essentially the entire southern Jutland, and many low-cost airlines also fly here. In addition to the airport, Billund is home to the Legoland park.

Billund Airport. It is written Billund, but pronounced [Billun] in Danish many letter combinations are shortened. In general, written Danish is quite similar to Swedish or Norwegian, but spoken Danish is difficult for Swedes to understand, since the pronunciation has gone somewhere far away, much like in English. For example, "street" in Swedish is gata, in Danish gade. But in Swedish it is read as it is written, and in Danish it is pronounced [ɡæːðə].

<p>
I was alone and in general I don’t like rides, so I left Legoland for later. In general, a ticket costs about 50-60 dollars; during the Christmas holidays there was also a cheap ticket for ~$25 without rides.

<p>
The nearest train station to Legoland is in Vejle, which is a 30-minute drive away.

<h2>Aalborg</h2>
<p>
Aalborg is a large city in northern Denmark. In general, the letter Å is usually used for the sound O in Scandinavian languages, but it is relatively new, and AA was traditionally used in place names. There was once a spelling reform to write with Å, but in Aalborg there was great resistance to this reform and it was eventually rolled back. But the neighboring city of Aarhus at that time was Århus.

It looks like it's a river, but it's actually a strait. Aalborg is located on the seashore, since the rather large northern part of Jutland is actually an island, separated by such a narrow strait. Interestingly, it became an island at the beginning of the 19th century, when a flood flooded the isthmus spit that connected it to the mainland (far from Aalborg).

I got acquainted with a regular supermarket. Here a cola costs 17 crowns, not 26. It’s still expensive, of course.

Interestingly, even in Denmark delivery is now common, and couriers wearing Wolt uniforms can be seen. Although it would seem that the delivery price here should be high.
