<h1>Samoa</h1>
<i>20-25 января 2020</i>
<p>
Samoa is a country in Polynesia, consisting of two adjacent islands, Upolu and Savaii. I spent five days in Samoa and traveled the length and breadth of the main island. Naturally, I was based in the capital - the city of Apia, and we’ll start there. This is the only city in Samoa, and not a small one - almost 40 thousand people.
<p/>

<p>
I rented a room in a guesthouse in the hills above the city, it was inexpensive - about $25, but I had to climb up the mountain.
<p/>

<p>
Apia is quite lively (except on Sundays) and has all the attributes of a full-fledged city. At the main intersection there is a clock tower, as in almost all former English colonies.

<p>
Behind it, on the ocean shore, there are several administrative buildings. Most, however, are located 5 kilometers from the center on a small peninsula.

A very beautiful Catholic cathedral is also not far from the clock tower.

<p>
In addition, there are two more large cathedrals in Apia. Adventist:
<p/>

<p>
And Mormon, away from the center near the main highway.

<p>
In Samoa, this is the place to go on holiday, as a lunch with a Big Mac costs more than $8 - more than in Australia and many US states. Probably, maintaining network standards in a country so remote from civilization requires expensive logistics.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257023923_d2b49ba87a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
For comparison, eating at a local fast food restaurant costs $3-4.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256478285_bb876a5695_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And in less civilized ones it’s even cheaper, from 1 dollar.

Behind the center of Apia, after the main road running along the island, the hills begin, occupying almost the entire central part of the island. You can wander around there a little.
<p/>

At the top at the end of this road, the writer Robert Stevenson (author of Treasure Island) is buried. I did not dare to go there, because heavy rain could pour down every minute, and there was nowhere to hide there.

In theory, married women wear it behind the left ear, unmarried ones - behind the right ear.

I only traveled by bus from the airport and back, and to explore the island I rented a car from this office for 80 tala ($30). In other places the price was one and a half times higher.

To see Samoa outside the capital, I rented this Japanese Toyota car. For the first time I got behind the wheel outside of Russia, and immediately in such an obscure country. The car was also right-hand drive, since in Samoa traffic is on the left (although until 2009 it was on the right). The hardest thing was to get used to the fact that the turn signals were on the other side.
<p/>

<p>
The island of Upolu has a road around the perimeter of the island and two large highways across it, one of which directly connects Apia to the southern coast. I immediately drove along it, the road goes sharply into the mountains, where there are thick clouds nearby and it can rain when it’s sunny on the coast.
<p/>

Here in the mountains there is a temple of the Baha'i religion.

Road to the coast. All roads outside the capital are approximately one-lane and usually have no markings.
<p/>

<p>
The quality of the roads is not very good; there are often potholes.

There are few beaches in Samoa; mostly on the south coast, and they are located in closed hotel areas. The road runs 2-3 kilometers from the coast, and to get to the coast you usually have to drive some distance on very bad asphalt.

Luckily, in Samoa, grass shoulders are wide enough to allow you to stop on them. In America there would be a fence here, and it would be possible to stop, at best, in 2-3 specially designated places.

On the second day with the car, I thought about taking the ferry in the morning to visit the second island of the country, Savaii, but I failed. The problem is that ferries depart rarely - at 6, 8 in the morning, and then only at 12, and if you go at 12, then you need to leave back by the last ferry at 16, that is, you have about three hours maximum. It was about 35 kilometers to the port from my hotel. I thought that if I left at 7 am, I would be there by 8. At 7:25 I stopped on the side of the road to take a break and discovered that I had only driven 10 kilometers and still had 25 to go, and that I had forgotten my temporary Samoan license at home (this is a piece of paper in addition to the regular license). Realizing that I wouldn’t make it to the ferry anyway, I turned around and went back. After having breakfast at home and picking up my license, I conducted an experiment and drove to the ferry without a single stop, measuring the time - 1 hour and 10 minutes passed. It was possible to go faster, but not much - the quality of the road in Samoa outside the capital leaves much to be desired. In the morning I drove even slower, because it was just dawn and it was raining buckets. So instead of Savaii, I explored the second half of Upolu Island.

In some villages the church is on the right of the road, in others on the left. Since there is no restriction on the left in the form of a seashore, there is usually an even larger area around the church.

An important element is also the faale - these are canopies under which you can sit during the day so that it does not rain. An analogue of the Russian "zavalinka".
<p/>

The next detail characteristic of Oceania is, of course, cemeteries. Here they are also frequent and are located close to houses.

Locals do not swim in the sea, but make a kind of pool right next to the shore so that sea water flows in.

It turned out that driving this section along the coast is not so easy, although the road is marked on the map. At first the road was normal, although narrow.

But at some point it turned into a dirt road, which was scary to drive even at 10 km/h, considering that I didn’t have a jeep.

After reaching a decent road, I first slammed the pedal to the floor with joy, accelerating by 5 seconds to 50, and then went to inspect the car from all sides.

Then the road to the capital was quite ordinary, through thickets and fields.

<p>
An hour and a half later I reached the capital, and then on the road another driver told me through the window that I had a flat tire. Indeed, when I stopped at a gas station, I immediately saw it. At the gas station I asked to change a spare tire, which they did for me for 10 tala ($4). It turned out that this was not difficult at all, and all the tools were lying along with the wheel at the bottom of the trunk, so next time I should do it myself. Immediately from the gas station, I went to the tire repair shop found on the map, where the deflated tire was repaired in 15 minutes, after pulling out a huge rusty nail from it - it turns out that I ran into it somewhere closer to the city, and not on that bad road. For the entire repair they charged the same 10 tala, so it turns out that I significantly overpaid for replacing the wheel. Also on the second day, at some point I left a scratch on the side of the front wheel, for which I was charged a fine of 15 tala ($6) when returning to the rental.

I have not yet reviewed a store on the islands of Oceania (only in <a href="../perth">Australia</a> and <a href="../nz-north">New Zealand</a>). The objective reason for this is the small number of large supermarkets in these countries. Now I will show you the Farmer Joe's store in Samoa - this is the largest grocery store I found there, and the most similar to the ones we are used to. I saw two stores of this chain - one outside the city, and one in the center.

What immediately catches your eye: although the sales area is large, it is half empty. From the first shelves to the cash registers where I stand, taking the first photo, it’s no less than five meters. There are only two rows of shelves, although 4-5 could easily fit here. If you take a closer look at the shelves, you can see that on them the same product takes up at least a meter of space, that is, there is almost no choice of goods of similar positions: there is one type of rice, one type of pasta, one type of canned food and one juice. Prices are in Samoan tala - to convert to dollars you need to divide by 2.6. A can of canned tomatoes or corn costs about $2.50.

Meat. Prices are approximately as follows: chicken $3/kilo, pork $4, beef $7.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256481930_2bf4709715_k.jpg"/>
<p>
Most importantly, pay attention to the quality of the meat - it is below par, solid fat, a lot of bones.

This is one of the reasons why Samoa and the other islands of Oceania occupy almost all the places in the top 10 countries by obesity rates. People who are not rich cannot buy quality products, which are also more expensive here than in large countries due to expensive logistics. New Zealand and Australia sell substandard trimmings here, since no one will buy steaks anyway.
