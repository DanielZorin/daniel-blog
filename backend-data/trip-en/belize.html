<h1>Belize: Belize City, Caye Caulker, Belmopan, San Ignacio</h1>
<i>16-18 October 2021</i>
<h2>Belize City</h2>
<p>
A journey through Central America begins with Belize - the smallest country, very different from the rest. Belize speaks English and is ethnically and culturally more similar to the Caribbean islands, which were also British colonies. The largest city, Belize City, is considered dangerous, but this is apparently in comparison with the United States, and not with neighboring countries. On Saturday and Sunday there is almost no public transport, so I had to take a taxi, which is quite expensive here - I had to pay $25 for the trip from the airport to the hotel (15 minutes).

<p>
Hotels in the city are expensive and are mainly located somewhere on the highway; in the center there are only a couple of very expensive ones. Tourists coming from America usually go straight to the resort islands without spending the night in the city.

On the route is the emblem of the Rotary Club and a call to get vaccinated against polio.

<p>
Closer to the center, Belize City looks like a typical Caribbean colonial town with clapboard houses (eg <a href="../barbados">Bridgetown</a>).

<h2>Caye Caulker</h2>
<p>
Along the coast of Belize is the Belize Barrier Reef, which appears on the surface as a chain of long and narrow islands with mangroves. Some of the islands have been turned into hotels, mostly expensive ones, like in <a href="../maldives">Maldives</a>, but there is one relatively budget one - Caye Caulker, where ferries go from Belize City (round trip $18). The journey takes about 45 minutes, and along the way you can admire the uninhabited islands.

The main difference is that the prices here are twice as expensive (and hotels are three to four times more expensive). The cheapest food costs about $5.

<h2>Belmopan</h2>
<p>
The capital of Belize was moved to Belmopan in 1970 (pre-independence) after Belize City was damaged by a hurricane. It's a small town and there's not much here other than administrative buildings, but it's not difficult to visit since it's right on the main road and all the buses go there.

<h2>San Ignacio</h2>
<p>
The next large city after Belmopan on the road to Guatemala is called San Ignacio, or colloquially Cayo after the name of the province. I stayed in a hotel on the central square with a bus station, everything is nearby, since the city is very small.

On the other side is the city of Santa Elena. By the way, the cities here have Spanish names - apparently, the influence of Guatemala. Belize was originally part of Guatemala, and radicals there still dream of its reconquest. In fact, Guatemala did not control this remote region; English colonists lived there on the shore, and later claimed rights to this territory, and Guatemala could not do anything with Britain.
