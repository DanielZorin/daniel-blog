<h1>Haiti: Port-au-Prince</h1>
<i>21-23 November 2016</i>
<h2>Port-au-Prince</h2>
<p>
Haiti proudly bears the title of the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. For more than 200 years since independence (and this is the second independent country in the New World after the United States!) the history of this country has been a never ending stream of civil wars, coups d'état and Tonton Macoutes. Traveling to Haiti is a real dive to the bottom of Africa. Let's go!

<p>
A plane from wealthy and successful Miami flies to Port-au-Prince, flying above Haiti from north to south along the way. Haiti occupies the western part of the island of Hispaniola. Off the northern coast is Tortuga, a small island that, together with Jamaica, was one of the main pirate bases during the golden age of piracy (1650-1730).

<p>
Now there is nothing special in Tortuga, an ordinary province of Haiti.

<p>
From above, Haiti looks like some kind of hilly steppe, although it is a tropical island.

<p>
The fact is that in Haiti there is a very serious problem of deforestation, a significant part of the population uses firewood as fuel, the forest area is sharply declining and already accounts for less than a third of the territory.

It can be seen that many areas are fenced off, but there are no houses inside, or there are only some small shacks.

Port-au-Prince airport turned out to be quite civilized. I got through passport control without any problems and bought a local SIM card for just $5 with a couple gigabytes of data. The operator promised 4G in Port-au-Prince and other major cities. Public transport in Port-au-Prince is bad (for a city of two million). There are overcrowded minibuses called “Tap-tap”, they drive very slowly and only through the center, the airport is quite far away, so I didn’t expect to get to the hotel by minibus, especially considering the approaching twilight. I had to take a taxi, which cost more than $15 - very expensive for a poor country, although even by car I traveled for almost an hour.
<p/>

<p>
At this time, I could feel like a typical American tourist in a poor country: exploring the city purely through the glass of a huge jeep, like on a safari, without stopping anywhere.
<p/>

Religiosity is here. Many cars have something written about Jesus on them.

We left the airport. It is immediately noticeable that a lot of people walk on the street. This is not Indonesia, where no one walks, everyone rides motorcycles. Haiti has its own atmosphere.

On the main streets the asphalt is quite good, but on the small streets it can be worse. A couple of years ago there was a powerful earthquake in Haiti that destroyed most of the capital.

Port-au-Prince is located on the hills, so all the roads here are steep and the transport routes are indirect.

How safe is Port-au-Prince? Neither I nor any blogger I know have been robbed in Haiti. Perhaps only really expereience hardened travellers who don't space out in sketchy cities go to Haiti. But on the streets I didn’t feel like it was particularly dangerous. Local residents are surprisingly indifferent to white tourists; no one shouts “Hello” to you or asks you to take a photo.

Up close, Port-au-Prince isn't that scary. Well, yes, it's dirty.

There are ice cream carts in the central square. It's cheap, a cone costs 10 gourdes ($0.15).

During the earthquake, the presidential palace on the main square was destroyed and lay in ruins for a couple of years, but now it has been restored, albeit surrounded by a fence.

Recently foam plastic containers for food came to Haiti, and now a problem has arisen: people are used to throwing garbage under their feet, but suddenly it does not just decompose.

It's visible that it suffered the most from the earthquake and was least restored.
<p/>

<p>
At every intersection in the center (and the streets are in a grid pattern) a heap of garbage has been collected.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257703225_7a123d0eab_h.jpg"/>

On larger streets, these heaps are flattened under the wheels of cars.

A brief history of Haiti is depicted in this picture, but I will point out a couple of interesting facts.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257703760_7eb49e1652_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Haiti achieved independence from France in 1804. The first uprising seemed to be successful, but when Napoleon learned about the situation in this distant colony and sent an army there, the leader of the revolution was quickly defeated and sent to a French prison. However, with the resumption of war between France and England in 1803, supplying the colonies in America by sea became impossible, and the Haitians won. Immediately after independence, all the whites were killed, so now Haiti is the blackest country in America. The most interesting thing is that France, England and the USA, that is, all the main countries, did not recognize Haiti and imposed an embargo, which was lifted only in 1825 in exchange for paying France retribution for lost property (slaves, that is). From the very beginning, the new country was at a disadvantage.

Haiti has been an empire twice. Yes, an empire. The first empire lasted only two years, from 1804 to 1806 - the first president looked at Napoleon and decided to do the same, but it ended badly. The one who overthrew him called himself just a king, and ruled only the northern half of the country. The south won the civil war, and Haiti became a republic, effectively a dictatorship. From 1822 to 1844, the Dominican Republic and Haiti were a single state, but after the fall of the dictatorship in 1843, the Spanish-speaking Dominican Republic separated. They still don't like Haiti. The general, who became dictator after a series of coups d'etat in 1849, declared himself the new emperor. The empire lasted 10 years, and the imperial crown remained in the museum.

During the second half of the 19th century, Haiti enjoyed relative stability. The economy and culture rose, but not for long; another revolution came in 1911. While everything was stable, a couple of hundred emigrants from Germany settled in Haiti, and by 1915 they controlled 80% of the country's economy. The Americans looked at what was happening near them while the First World War was going on, where Germany was a potential enemy, and decided to send troops to Haiti. The occupation lasted until 1934. The Americans bought up land, drove the country into debt, but they built roads, infrastructure, and established democracy, although not for long. The first president wanted to run for a third term, however, this was before the United States entered World War II in 1941, so he was dissuaded. But his successor had already become friendly with the dictator of the Dominican Republic, Trujillo, and in 1946 he rose to power with the first military junta in the history of Haiti. A few more revolutions, and in 1956 Francois Duvalier, nicknamed Papa Doc, became president. He was once a doctor and a promising politician, but power corrupted him. Duvalier began to struggle with the fact that the elite of Haiti consisted of mulattoes, who controlled most of the money, as a result, most of the educated people left the country, and the “Tonton Macoutes” - the Haitian analogue of the Red Guard - ruled the streets. In 1964, Duvalier declared himself president for life, and there was no one left to protest. In 1971, Papa Doc died, and Baby Doc, Jean-Claude Duvalier, became president, and plundered the country for another 15 years, but the end is still the same - suitcase, airport, Paris. After the revolution of 1986 and the short rule of the junta, a new lover of golden toilets arrived - Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who ruled intermittently until 2004.

By the way, the first settlement founded by Columbus in the New World, La Navidad, was located in the north of Haiti. The museum claims that this is the anchor of the Santa Maria, Columbus's ship, but this is not certain.

Since the level of education in Haiti is extremely low, any new ideologies can be introduced here. The Muslims also came to the rescue, although they had never been here before.

To get to the Dominican Republic, you need to get into the back of a truck going to the border, which is 50 kilometers away. It costs around 1 dollar. The trucks depart from the city of Croix-des-Bouquets, adjacent to Port-au-Prince, to which I drove 15 kilometers through hills and windy traffic jams on a motorcycle taxi. From the back you can see a little bit of life in the province.
