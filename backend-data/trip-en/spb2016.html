<h2>Saint Petersburg</h2>
<p>
I have long wanted to live longer in St. Petersburg - why not? I came from Belarus to Vitebsk Station, and it so happened that I lived there, in an alley next to Gorokhovaya Street - one of the three main streets of St. Petersburg, starting at the Admiralty.

Winter has come. I've been to St. Petersburg many times before, but only in the summer, so I didn't expect nice weather. But in the end, everything turned out to be very good, there was snow most of the time, and in general, winter St. Petersburg is no less beautiful than summer.

Now I lived on Third Sovetskaya Street - this is the historical district of Peski ("Sands"), north of the Moskovsky station. Quite a convenient place, since it was a 10-minute walk to the station, and even closer to Nevsky Prospekt.

The closest part of Nevsky Prospekt was after the bend at Vosstaniya Square. This part is not as popular as between the station and Palace Square.

An advantage of the location near the Vitebsky station is the proximity of the Sennoy market, where even in winter you can buy cheap fruits and vegetables. The main secret of shopping is not to be greedy and not to buy more than 2-3 days worth of food so that nothing gets spoiled.

The border between the Central and Admiralteysky districts runs along Gorokhovaya Street. The Admiralteysky district seems to be close to the center, but the area is not the best - there are a lot of slums and favelas, and there is no metro (only at the edges). In the east there are also industrial areas and shipyards.

The main historical part of the Admiralteysky district is called Kolomna (as a city in the Moscow region). Here, the residential buildings of the 19th century have remained almost untouched, with a very small number of office buildings compared to the central areas. A walk around Kolomna looks something like this:

One day, out of curiosity, I went to see the infamous areas of St. Petersburg that blogger Varlamov talked about so many times: Murino and Parnas. Both of them are located in the north of the city near the end stations of the red and blue metro lines, respectively.
<i>Life in Russia is slow suicide</i>

<p>
Murino is technically not a part of St. Petersburg, but part of the Leningrad region. This fact creates certain problems for local residents, because... The central offices of all government services are located in Vsevolozhsk (the regional center), which is not close to here at all.

On various occasions, I visited other unpretentious areas of St. Petersburg, both in the north and in the south.

While I lived in St. Petersburg, I visited local famous museums several times. Once a month everyone is allowed into the Hermitage for free, which I took advantage of. In fact, as it turned out, this is not a very good way, because even in winter, when there are much fewer tourists, there is a very long queue at the entrance, and you can stand for a couple of hours on the street. On the other hand, the Hermitage consists of two parts: the main one in the Winter Palace and the second in the General Staff building (on the other side of Palace Square). There was no queue for the second part even on the free day.

It’s interesting that there are four “Black Squares”. This is the second oldest, and part of a triptych with a circle and a cross. The very first one is kept in the Tretyakov Gallery, as is the third one. The fourth was kept in someone's attic until the 1990s, when he gave it to the bank as collateral for a loan that he never repaid. As a result, the painting was sold and transferred to the Hermitage.

Peterhof is an administrative part of St. Petersburg, a small city on the southern side of the Gulf of Finland, where the famous palace is located. I was there only once in 2002. There is a railway in Peterhof, but it is a bit far from the palace (and the second station is in Old Peterhof, where the buildings of the St. Petersburg State University are located). There are buses from the Baltiysky Station to Peterhof, but if you do not live near this station, it is more convenient to go from the Avtovo metro station.

Peterhof, in addition to the palace, is quite interesting; historical buildings have been preserved here. In 1944, the city was renamed Petrodvorets (apparently, so as not to have a German name - at the same time they renamed <a href="../spb2014">Shlisselburg</a> to Petrokrepost), the old name was returned in 1997, but the administrative district is still Petrodvortsovy.

At the end of this canal there is a pier where you can sail from the center of St. Petersburg in the summer.

Pushkin, also known as Tsarskoye Selo (King's village), is also a city annexed as a district to St. Petersburg. As in Peterhof, I was there only back in 2001 or 2002; my memories needed to be refreshed. Trains run to Pushkin from Vitebsky Station - once this section was the very first railway in Russia. You can also get there by bus from the Moskovskaya metro station.

Pushkin station. The station is officially called Tsarskoye Selo. It is interesting that until 2013 it was called Detskoye Selo (Children's village) - after the name of the city from 1918 to 1937 (and from October 1917 to the end of 1918 the city was also Soldatskoye Selo - Soldiers' village).
