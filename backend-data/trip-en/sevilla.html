<h1>Spain: Malaga, Granada, La Linea, Seville</h1>
<i>21-25 July 2016</i>
<h2>Malaga</h2>
<p>
I came to Spain for the eleventh time, after a break of almost two years. For the visa I needed a direct flight, I chose Malaga because I had already been to Barcelona five times.
<p/>

<p>
Malaga is a pleasant seaside city, albeit without top attractions.
<p/>

<p>
Almost the entire center is pedestrian, and on a dry summer day the tiles glisten in the sun.

I understood why these canopies are needed over shopping streets - so that there is shade! I used to be in Spain all the time in winter or fall and didn’t feel the heat. Although after Southeast Asia, Spain is not that hot.

If you walk further, you will get to the city beach.

<p>
Compared to the top beaches in Malaysia, this beach is very bad, like most other beaches in Europe. There are a lot of people, the water is dirty and cloudy, there is no underwater world. The landscapes are not heavenly at all. Well, it’s okay to lie on the sand.

In the center of Malaga there is an old castle on a hill.

<h2>Granada</h2>
<p>
Granada is home to the famous Alhambra Castle, where the Arab rulers of Spain once lived before they were finally driven out at the end of the 15th century.
<p/>

The statue of the Virgin Mary was placed directly in the arch with typical Muslim decor.

By the way, I was in Alhambra on my very, very first trip abroad in 1996 (I was 6 years old).
<p/>

<p>
Since then, the number of tourists in Spain has grown greatly, and now, to get to the Alhambra in the summer, you need to buy a ticket in advance via the Internet. A ticket, however, is only needed to enter the Moorish palace; you can walk around the territory anyway.

In addition to the Moorish castle, on the territory of the Alhambra there is a palace built later, under Charles V.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256139546_21794535dd_o.jpg">
<p>
The palace was not finished; it stood without a roof until the mid-20th century.

Announcements about rooms for rent. At the bottom right they are looking for girl neighbors, rooms for 140 and 180 euros - the price is the same as in the center of St. Petersburg, cheaper than Moscow. Top right, for 450 euros you can get a room with three meals a day.

<h2>Seville</h2>
<p>
In Seville, I found accommodation on airbnb for only 10 euros per day. On the outskirts of the city, but this also had a plus: when I went further to Portugal in a Blablacar, it was very convenient, because the highway to the west passed right under the window. And in this house you could go out onto the roof to see a panorama of the residential areas of Seville.

In the center of one of the squares there was a canopy in the shape of futuristic mushrooms.

In 1929, the Spanish government decided that there were still not enough cool architectural ensembles in Seville, and they built one more grandiose than all the others. That year, the international Expo took place mostly in Barcelona, and in Seville they placed expositions of Latin American countries in order to make their interaction with Spain closer.

That day it was 44 degrees, but in the shade you don’t feel it at all: Seville is dry. In Indonesia, even at 30 it’s hard to walk.

In Europe they began to make automatic stores, like in China. Very relevant, considering that many things are closed on Sundays.

We had dinner at a place that served “tapas” - Spanish snacks. A very popular place, although no one is invited from the street, apparently there are many regular customers.

Menu. Tapa portions cost 2-3 euros, you can take several dishes to try.

By Russian standards, Spanish “tapas” would be complete meals. Yes, all 4 dishes on the table are "tapas", everything together with a glass of wine cost about 13 euros.

Someone put a box of unnecessary things on the street. Among them you can see as many as two kilogram packs of Maria cookies, each of which contained four separately packaged cylindrical blocks. I took one pack for my stash, and then we ate these cookies for a long time. Three quarters reached Russia, then I took them with me on a trip to the Baltics and Scandinavia, and the last pack also went with me to America and the Caribbean, where I almost finished them, there were literally a few cookies left, which stayed at the bottom backpack, along with a supply of tea, and later also traveled around India and Southeast Asia. This is how a pack of cookies visited 30  countries.
