<h1>Sint Maarten</h1>
<i>13-15 November 2016</i>
<p>
One of the most interesting Caribbean islands is divided into two parts: two thirds of the island belong to France, one third to the Netherlands, but the Dutch part is more popular, most of the infrastructure is on it. Since this is Europe, the prices here are not as outrageous as in the USA and its colonies. You can rent a hotel room for 40 dollars, i.e. comparable in prices to France and the Netherlands. I rented an entire yacht parked in the port on airbnb for $30.

The yacht from the inside. This is the wardroom.

<p>
In the nose there is a triangular-shaped bed.

<p>
There is a shower and toilet in front of it.

<p>
Electricity and water are supplied from the port and there are springs at each parking space. The yacht also has a solar battery. Even Wi-fi works if the electricity that powers the 3G access point is not cut off. By the way, the electricity was cut off every day, at such moments there was light only in the McDonald's across the road from the port, which apparently had its own generator. The owner of the yacht told me that power outages happen all the time in Sint Maarten.

<p>
Nearby there is a bridge across a narrow bay where yachts are parked. Across this bridge the border with the French part of the island begins.

The flag of Dutch Sint Maarten is similar to the Philippine flag.

<p>
The capital of Sint Maarten is called Philipsburg. The city is similar to other American-style resort towns in the Caribbean. It doesn't look much like Holland.

The same stores with jewelry.

Courthouse. Something vaguely similar to this can be found in Indonesia, if you dig deeper.

Philipsburg is very small, only about five parallel streets, between the lake and the sea.

More shopping for tourists!

<p>
Further from the main street there are old wooden houses.

<p>
From Philipsburg I decided to walk to the yacht, which is 10-12 kilometers along the coast. From the first hill you can see all of Philipsburg.

The first Dutch fortress on the island is located on this peninsula. There is an area with VIP villas around.

No one walks in residential areas.
<p/>

<p>
Slowly, construction is eating into the hillsides that cover most of the island.

Street signs in Sint Maarten are very similar to American ones.

<p>
The Maps.me map promised a short walking path along the coast here, but in the end there was none.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255520991_c74a82d578_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Construction is starting in this area.
<p/>

<p>
They haven't even finished the road yet.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256270249_8fb3e2f93d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It will be near a beach.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255725923_42a9d35e43_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are still places available.

<p>
And here, finally, is the bay where my yacht is moored.

<p>
Sint Maarten has its own currency - the florin (or guilder). The exchange rate is pegged to the dollar: 1 USD = 1.8 florins; you can pay in dollars everywhere. In the store near the yacht, prices are indicated only in florins. In McDonald's and many other places it is written in two currencies, with larger sign in dollars. Gouda cheese costs 10.43 florins per 485 grams.

<p>
Chicken legs cost 5 florins per kilogram, that is $2.5. Well, acceptable. If you cook, you can also live in the Caribbean; restaurants, of course, are very expensive everywhere.

<p>
The main attraction of Sint Maarten is the airport. About 6 hours before departure I went to see it on foot.
<p/>

The runway is behind the fence.

A sign warning people not to stand in the path of an airplane.

<p>
Naturally, this is exactly what everyone comes here for.
<p/>

<p>
People packed on the beach.

<p>
Planes land quite often, but mostly they are small planes that fly between the islands, they land quite high above the beach.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255521436_b661200264_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It's a different story with large planes, arriving mainly from Miami, New York, as well as daily direct flights from Paris and Amsterdam.

KLM from Amsterdam.

<p>
Also American.

<p>
Nearby they sell souvenir license plates.

<p>
Takeoff is also fun. The planes take off in the other direction, but before they accelerate, they approach the beach, and when the engines turn on, those standing on the beach are blown into the sea (which is why the signs do not recommend standing by the fence).

And this is what this beach looks like from the air.
