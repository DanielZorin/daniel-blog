<h1>Israel: Jerusalem</h1>
<i>February 4, 2010</i>
<p>
From Egypt I went on a one-day excursion to Israel. The program included Jerusalem, Bethlehem and the Dead Sea. In fact, we saw very little, as on any similar excursion. There was an observation deck in Jerusalem.

That's it! There was also the Dead Sea. Later I saw it from the <a href="../jordan">Jordan</a> side.
