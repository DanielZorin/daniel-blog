<h2>Hong Kong</h2>
<p>
The most affordable housing in Hong Kong is located in the Chungking mansions residential complex. I already stayed there for one night in <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/295687.html">2013</a>, but this time I stayed in the "mansions" for 10 days, exploring everything, and I was even able to get onto the roof.
<p/>

<p>
There is also cheap housing further north along Nathan Street near the Mongkok metro station, but Chungking mansions are simply ideally located - you can walk to Mongkok, or you can walk to the Star Ferry in 10 minutes and move to Hong Kong Island for just over 2 HKD (the metro is 6 times more expensive). I was there in the summer, it's low season, and the prices were lower than in the fall: a double room cost about 20 dollars (150 HKD). It's worth booking in advance at Chungking mansions if you want to check in on Friday or Saturday - there is an influx of weekend tourists from China, and on these days prices start at $30 (240 HKD). Downstairs at the entrance there are barkers who offer hotels at low prices. If you arrive on a weekday, ideally you need to agree several days in advance, including weekends, then the price on a weekend will be the same as on a weekday.
The rooms in Chungking mansions are traditionally very small, but quite cozy.

Everything you need is there.

Above there was a room for the weekend, and we lived in this room most of the time. The bed has high legs so there is somewhere to put the luggage.
<p/>

<p>
There is even a refrigerator, which is so lacking in many hotels. In general, everything you need for life is here.

The first room had only one advantage - it had a gorgeous view from the window.

For some reason, some people here don’t think it’s shameful to throw trash out of the window.

Theoretically, you can live in “mansions” without going outside at all. Food is sold on the ground floor, but mostly Indian, the portions are small, and the prices are very high. It's better to eat at the Chinese or at McDonald's.

Elevator. I have often heard complaints that there is always a queue for the elevator, but in 10 days of living in two different buildings I have never waited long at the bottom; at most I have to miss one elevator. It’s more problematic to go down - the elevator from above often arrives full, so I almost always went down the stairs on foot, from the sixth floor it's not that high. You can see the situation on the monitor.

One day I went to explore the upper floors. In block D, one of the exits to the roof was not closed. A bare-chested European sat near the stairs and smoked a cigarette.

Less than three minutes had passed when a man appeared on the roof of the next block and shouted at me to get off the roof.

While searching for a repair shop, I found myself in yet another old high-rise building. Walking along the street of Mongkok, you won’t even notice the nondescript sign.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256025312_fcdd0515bd_o.jpg">

If it weren’t for this, I would never have guessed that this was not the entrance to a residential building.

<p>
And this building of 25  floors is densely packed with shops. These small businesses seem to sell mostly online, so they don't need flashy signs. The narrow corridor is crammed with 5-6 offices on each floor.

In the center of Hong Kong there are no grandiose traffic intersections as in <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/396167.html">Chongqing</a>, but there are narrow dark alleys combined with tall old buildings and pipes everywhere, they create the right cyberpunk atmosphere.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256387603_3ac997c9cb_o.jpg">
<p>
A typical Hong Kong alley, most of them, of course, are in Kowloon, but there are also some on the island (this photo is from the island). You won't see this in new areas.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256954593_0db911118b_o.jpg">
<p>
In such places you can find budget eateries, like this one - prices range from 1.5 to 3.5 dollars; usually it will be more expensive to eat in Hong Kong.

An interesting feeling from a walk in the center in the evening. In certain areas there are a lot of people, in Times Square, for example, and when you drive through the business districts, it seems that everyone has died out.

I have not seen cemeteries in other places in Hong Kong. Perhaps the problem of lack of space extends to the dead too.

I discovered an alternative route to this attraction - instead of taking the bus for ~$2.5 you can walk. The descent is easy and interesting.

There are so many wealthy tourists from China in Hong Kong that there is a wide network of jewelry stores here. It's like 7-11, but instead of chips and Coca-Cola, it's gold and diamonds.

A visit to Hong Kong is incomplete without nature trips to all sorts of remote islands. To <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/296023.html">not to repeat myself</a>, this time I went to the islands of Lamma and Lantau. It is better to travel around the islands on weekdays, because on weekends ferries are 50% more expensive.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256935574_8ae3f55627_o.jpg">
<p>
Lamma Island is fairly close to the less developed southern coast of Hong Kong Island. There are no high-rise buildings here, only two villages on opposite ends of the island.

There are several fresh seafood restaurants near the ferry terminal in the south. The prices are like this. 1 dollar = 8 HKD, that is, a set with lobsters for two costs about $70. Not even that expensive for a high-end dinner.
