<h1>Turkey: Antalya</h1>
<i>22-23 April 2024</i>
<h2>Antalya</h2>
<p>
I had an early appointment on my next trip to Antalya, so I arrived the day before and booked a hotel. Thinking about what to see that I hadn't seen yet, I headed to the port to see Antalya from the water.

There are short cruises (about an hour) that cost a little over $10 (350 lira), and long ones for two hours, to the Duden waterfall, for 550 lira. But the long ones only go once a day, so I had to jump on the short one.

First a little towards Konyaalti, there is a cliff, above which a large street passes.

I don't know this part of Antalya as well. There are quite a few hotels on the coast here. There are small patches with sun loungers on the rocks.

It turns out that there is another small waterfall right in the sea, although it is artificial.
