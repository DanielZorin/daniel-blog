<h1>USA: Newark, New York</h1>
<i>19-20 May 2022</i>
<h2>Newark</h2>
<p>
Newark is a suburb of New York, located in the state of New Jersey just behind <a href="../new-york">Jersey City</a>. Newark is home to one of New York's three major airports. While looking for somewhere to stay for one night in New York, I discovered that Newark was much cheaper than, for example, the similarly remote outskirts of New York itself. Since I was flying into this airport, I decided to stay there, renting a room for only $35 (for comparison, a bed in the cheapest hostel in the city cost $70). In principle, the ride wasn’t even very far - 4 stops on the tram or half an hour on foot to the station   30 minutes to Manhattan by subway.

The flight was not bad. Here are the islands in the Chesapeake Bay (near <a href="../baltimore">Baltimore</a>).

They usually say about New Jersey that it is a very bad state (like losers live there who couldn’t succeed in New York), but here it looks pretty good, the houses are at a great distance from each other.

The center of Newark, as in a typical American city, is a block of high-rise buildings in the middle of low-rise buildings.

<p>
From the airport to downtown Newark you can take the train for $10 or the bus for $1.60. In general, travel in Newark costs 1.60, either by bus or by tram, and in New York it's 2.75, almost twice as expensive.

The PATH train is essentially a subway line connecting Manhattan to cities in New Jersey. The fare is the same as the subway, 2.75; New York tickets are accepted, but transfers are not discounted.

<h2>New York</h2>
<p>
My first trip to America began in New York, and my (possibly) last (for a long time) trip ends there. I don't really like New York and since then I've only been there <a href="../boston">once passing through</a>, not staying for long on purpose. But in 2022, I specifically wanted to take a walk, because it is very symbolic.

The next day I decided to go see the Statue of Liberty to make it as symbolic as possible. The statue is located on a small island south of Manhattan, and can only be reached by excursion ferry (the last time I saw it from the water was from the public Staten Island Ferry).

On Ellis Island in the late 19th and first half of the 20th century there was a customs house through which all those arriving in New York by ship (that is, most migrants of that time) passed through.
