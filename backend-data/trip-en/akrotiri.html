<h1>Akrotiri and Dhekelia</h1>

What is a country? How to calculate how many countries you have been to? It is clear that for such purposes it is not entirely correct to take into account only independent states. Firstly, France and French Polynesia are two very different entities. Secondly, from the point of view of the Russian government, Abkhazia is independent, but Kosovo is not, but from the point of view of the US government, it is exactly the opposite. It is therefore reasonable to consider partially recognized states and self-governing territories with their own border controls as separate countries. This definition is still not complete. For example, for some reason, in many lists of “countries” the Åland Islands and the islands of Jersey, Guernsey and Maine are considered separate countries, although they do not have their own border controls, and they are very close to their metropolis. Why then not consider eastern Malaysia a separate country, where even passports are stamped upon arrival from the western part of the country?
Looking at the Google map of Limassol in search of something interesting, I discovered the state border right on the outskirts of the city. After Britain gave Cyprus independence, two small enclaves, Akrotiri (near Limassol) and Dhekelia (near Ayia Napa), remained under the sovereignty of the UK. These territories have strategic importance - there are British army bases there. Formally, Akrotiri and Dhekelia have the status of an overseas territory (British Overseas Territory), that is, if Gibraltar, the Falklands, the Caymans and Pitcairn are considered countries, then Akrotiri should as well. Akrotiri and Dhekelia differ from other overseas territories (except for the territory in the Indian Ocean) in that there is no permanent civilian population (according to the agreement with Cyprus civilians can't live there), no elections (only military command), no border controls, but they have their own laws.
I took the bus and went to look at this “country”.

This is the outskirts of Limassol, there is a new port where all the cargo ships come (unlike the yachts of millionaires who hang out in the old port in the city center).

Akrotiri begins around this bend.

Once Akrotiri begins, the road ends.

The road is broken, like in the Russian province.

There are some apocalyptic landscapes around.

Mordor.

Theoretically, there is a beach here.

You can appreciate the beautiful coastline.

The feeling is that you are in an abandoned Soviet resort. Even the design quality is appropriate.

All in all, this British Overseas Territory is not a very attractive place.

We need to get out of here.
