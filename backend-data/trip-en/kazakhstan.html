<h1>Kazakhstan: Almaty</h1>
<i>27-29 April 2013</i>
<h2>Almaty</h2>
<p>
Several things surprised me about Kazakhstan. Let's start with the fact that there is relatively little political propaganda on billboards. Even in Kyrgyzstan there are more, not to mention such recognized masters as Tajikistan, Belarus and Transnistria. This is despite the fact that there is not even a semblance of democracy in the country, the president will officially and legally rule forever. Apparently, like in Russia, in Almaty there are many people who are satisfied with the regime and receive profit from it, and in the villages they are happy with the improvements that exist. The only portrait of Nazarbayev that I found on the streets of Almaty:

True, on the way down from the TV tower I came across a sort of social advertising corner. Four billboards stood on both sides of the street.

Kazakhstan has a gorgeous flag. Almaty also sells excellent “Kazakhstan” chocolate, with a flag on the wrapper.

In Almaty, east meets west. Here they can already call you “brother” (as in Uzbekistan), but in some places the infrastructure is almost European. For example, bike paths on the main street.

There are two types of buses in Almaty - new low-floor and old high-floor. In low-floor ones, you need to throw coins into a special machine that prints a ticket. The fare costs $0.5 (80 tenge). Sometimes inspectors enter the buses and check tickets.

The board on the bus shows horoscopes, aphorisms, interesting facts, advertising, anything except up-to-date information about the route and stops.

<p>
On old buses, at the exit you have to pay to the conductor, who calls people at the stops, shouting where the bus is going. The conductors have a standard ribbon with tickets hanging on their belts, but usually they don’t bother issuing them.

A significant part of the population, especially in the northern part of the country along the border with Russia, does not speak Kazakh fluently. Kazakh courses are popular. Most people speak Russian.

I was unlucky - it rained all day, so I couldn’t go to the mountains. The city was shrouded in fog.

For two days I walked past this artifact, standing right in front of the hotel, and noticed it just before leaving.

A popular product throughout Central Asia is beautiful telephone numbers. Long lists of available numbers are posted right on the stalls. A number with four sevens costs as much as 10,000 tenge - $60.
