<h2>Doha</h2>
<p>
I flew to South Africa on Qatar Airways with a connection in Qatar - it was the cheapest option, costing only $550 round trip. On the way back when landing there were very good views from the window.

I only had 45 minutes for the scheduled transfer, which was a bit close. The first flight departed on time and landed a little ahead of schedule (usually schedules are designed so that there is a small margin of time), so in fact I had about an hour. But Doha airport is designed strangely for such a large hub: boarding and disembarking here is almost always via buses, which take a very long time, especially when you disembark. Then you have to go through security control, fortunately there was no line there early in the morning. And then I still had to take the train to the other end of the terminal.

I reached the gate on time; boarding was still in progress. And then suddenly the girl at the gate threw away my boarding pass and gave me this one instead:

This was my first time in business class (it was my 497th flight). And in Qatar Airways business class. The flight to Istanbul lasted about five hours, but they put on a plane with a full business class cabin, which looked like this:

<p>
On short flights, business class is often almost no different from economy class, well, maybe there are two seats in a row instead of three. But here it's different: each passenger has his own mini-compartment.

<p>
By pressing a button on the control panel, you can quietly fold the seat into a bed. This was very useful, since I slept little on the first flight, but here I had a good rest.

<p>
Flight attendants. They clearly have more work to do in business class than in economy. One flight attendant here serves ~10 people, no more.

Even before boarding, I was offered all sorts of exotic drinks:

<p>
There is also a menu, and you need to order food of your choice (for each item, and not just the main course, as in economy).

<p>
There is even a wine list, but I didn’t take alcohol because I don’t like it, especially in the morning.

Takeoff. The turbine is a bit of a nuisance.

<p>
The flight attendant wrote down the food order before takeoff, and also asked when to bring it (here you can get food at any time). I asked to get it immediately after takeoff so I could sleep later. First they gave me a croissant.

Fruit salad. The set is impressive: orange, pineapple, mango, papaya, melon, strawberry, pitaya and even blueberry. From all over the world!

After a good sleep, I landed in Istanbul. But next time I’m unlikely to buy a business class ticket. A ticket from Istanbul to Johannesburg costs about $3,500, which is 6 times more expensive than economy! You can buy an economy ticket and upgrade it to business before your flight (including during online check-in). It costs a little less, if I remember correctly, it was offered to me for $700 one way. But it's still too much.
