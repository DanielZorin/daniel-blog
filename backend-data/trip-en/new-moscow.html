<h1>Russia: Zelenograd, Moskovsky, Shcherbinka, Troitsk</h1>

<h2>Zelenograd</h2>
<p>
Before the expansion of Moscow in 2011, the farthest part of the capital from the center was the Zelenograd administrative okrug. Zelenograd was built in the 1960s from scratch, and almost immediately became part of Moscow, although it is 20 kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road. Zelenograd was initially created as a city of scientific institutes and high-tech industries, but over time there were more residents than jobs, and now many people go to the center of Moscow to work either by train in the Leningrad direction, or by bus to Khovrino, Planernaya or Mitino. Zelenograd officially consists of five districts, which are divided into numbered microdistricts.

Kryukovo station takes us to the Old Kryukovo area. The railway divides the city in half, behind it is located New Kryukovo, which was annexed to Zelenograd later.

<p>
In Zelenograd, streets have names, but they are not particularly remembered, because the addresses simply indicate the number of the house ("building"). The first 1-2 digits are the microdistrict number from 1 to 23, and the next two are the house number. Old Kryukovo includes microdistricts 8 and 9.

On the other side of the road is a research institute and an industrial zone. Near this building there was a monument to Lenin walking and reading a book, but in the 2010s it was demolished due to disrepair. Now Zelenograd is the only Moscow district where there are no monuments to Lenin.

Zelenograd is one of the most car-oriented cities in Russia. All the roads here are very large, there are almost no small streets. A colossal number of overpasses, I have never seen so many before.

Finally, the last district is Kryukovo, this is the entire part behind the railway. Half the population of Zelenograd lives there, and there are not enough railway crossings. New neighborhoods are being built in this part of the city.

New Moscow consists of two administrative districts: Novomoskovsky / NAO (closer to the Moscow Ring Road) and Troitsky / TAO (further from the Moscow Ring Road), which are divided not into districts, like other okrugs, but into settlements (before annexation - “rural settlements”). There are 10 settlements and one urban district (Shcherbinka) in the New Moscow Okrug, and in the Troitsky Autonomous Okrug there are 9 settlements and the Troitsk urban district. Before joining Moscow, most of the NAO was part of the Leninsky district, where the city of Vidnoye and Gorki Leninskie are. Most of the TAO was in the Podolsk district, and the rest was in the Naro-Fominsk district. In the settlements themselves, the territory is not further subdivided, but includes populated areas: villages, urban-type settlements and one city - Moskovsky (literally: "belonging to Moscow"). If earlier the addresses there began with “Moscow region, Moskovsky city,” now it has become even more fun: “Moscow city, Moskovsky city, Moskvitina street.” The Moskovsky settlement (of which Moskovsky is the capital) starts from the Moscow Ring Road and includes several metro stations: Govorovo, Rumyantsevo and Salaryevo. I still remember the first time I came to Salaryevo in 2016, when buses began to run from there to Vnukovo airport, and there was an open field around the station, and now there is the Salaris shopping center and new residential areas.

From Shcherbinka I went to two neighboring settlements of the Novomoskovsky Okrug. The settlement of Ryazanovskoye belonged to the territory of Podolsk before its annexation to Moscow. The most interesting thing in this settlement is the village of Ostafyevo and the airport of the same name located next door. The bus passes by the airport, but the terminal building is a little in the background; from the street only the hotel buildings and cafes are visible. Ostafyevo Airport is used only for business aviation; there are no regular flights there.

I returned to Shcherbinka. This includes the “ledge” on which the military garrison at Ostafyevo airport is located. Now this is not a closed area, but an ordinary residential area, only part is given over to a military base. The military town also consists of small two-three-story old houses.

On the horizon is the Voskresenskoye settlement. If you look at the map, you can see that it has a very strange border: in addition to the main territory, there is a long and very narrow strip of land that goes around Shcherbinka on all sides. There is nothing on this strip; in some places it is as wide as a street (as in the territory of the Ostafyevo garrison). Until 2011, the settlement of Voskresenskoye (as well as other territories of New Moscow along the Moscow Ring Road) belonged to the Leninsky district, and this strip connected the two parts of the region, which would otherwise have been divided by Shcherbinka and Podolsk. And now the streak is going nowhere.

Troitsk is one of two (together with Shcherbinka) full-fledged cities in New Moscow. The Troitsk Administrative Okrug begins with it - the largest in area and the smallest in population. The Troitsk okrug makes up as much as 43% of the area of ​​Moscow, and only 130 thousand people live there, half of them in Troitsk itself. Troitsk is a science city, we can say that it is the southern sister city of Zelenograd.

Troitsk consists of two parts: the new center, in the south, where the institutes are, and the old center, near the former estate and worsted factory. I drove into the city from the south, here on the square there is a sign and the Trinity Church in Troitsk.

After Troitsk, I decided to see the remaining areas of the New Moscow okrug. They are quite sparsely populated, but they are not so far from the Moscow Ring Road, so getting there is not difficult. The settlement of Desenovskoye (in honor of the village and river called Desna) is directly next to Troitsk, and there is the most active residential construction along the Kaluga Highway, probably because there will be a metro here in a few years - the extension of the Kommunarskaya line to Troitsk has already been approved. The village of Desna with less than 1000 inhabitants no longer rules when there is the “village” of Vatutinki with a population of 20 thousand.

Then the Filimonkovskoe settlement begins. I arrived just in the village of Filimonki - the largest settlement, about 2,500 inhabitants.

In Filimonki there was the Prince Vladimir Monastery, from which two unusual churches remained.

First of all, of course, this one. Its architectural style is designated as “neo-Gothic”, but even in this rather rare genre it stands out for its unique geometric patterns.

Previously, this church was difficult to access, because... it was located on the territory of a psychoneurological clinic, but now it has been fenced off by a wall from the clinic and a separate entrance has been made.

Nearby there is also a small church in pseudo-Russian style.

The last two settlements were located away from the rest; the most convenient way to get there is by train from the Kievsky station, so as not to make a roundabout taxiing onto the Solntsevskaya metro line. The first was the settlement of Kokoshkino near the train station of the same name. There are wooden walkways at the station, just like in the streets of Arkhangelsk.
