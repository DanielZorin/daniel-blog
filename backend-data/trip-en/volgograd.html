<h1>Russia: Volgograd, Elista, Astrakhan</h1>
<i>2-5 August 2014</i>
<h2>Volgograd</h2>
<p>
The first thing I saw in Volgograd was a sign next to which everyone takes pictures.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256767855_1f8f9b0b64_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also a deputy in glasses with a suitable first and last name <i>Artem Lebedev - sounds similar to Artemy Lebedev, who designed the sign above</i>.
<p/>

<p>
Volgograd airport, like most Russian airports, is small and cramped. There are 3-4 flights a day from the airport to Moscow and one to Turkey, but the waiting room is so small that even passengers of one flight are cramped. In Soviet times, airports did not have modern security systems, so there is less waiting space there than at a train station.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256767885_61fd199d98_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The main (and practically the only) attraction of Volgograd is Mamayev Kurgan.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255926368_2d239441e3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
First of all, this is, of course, the gigantic Motherland.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256129947_3fd576b2af_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And also several interesting sculptural compositions.
<p/>

<p>
Just like in the USSR, the rulers loved to praise themselves. Modern bureaucrats are not so vain, but more selfish.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255926478_04886a420a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
By the way, it was the day of the Airborne Forces, the paratroopers were swimming in the fountains.
<p/>

<p>
Another attraction of Volgograd is the Volga-Don Canal named after Lenin. You can look at the gateways.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254994117_a2ade5dd2f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On the arch it is written: “Glory to the great Lenin.”
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255724106_106bc73f59_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At the entrance to the canal there is a monument to Lenin, notable because it is the largest monument to Lenin in the world. And before the Khrushchev era, an equally huge monument to Stalin stood on the other pedestal. On the day that Stalingrad was renamed Volgograd, the monument was demolished.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257603939_3f79728640_h.jpg"/>
<p>
More attractions: Pavlov's House (it took many days for the Germans to storm it during the battle).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256857886_acc278b766_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A colonnade was attached to it on the reverse side and a monument to Lenin was erected.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255724336_3bef887348_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is what Stalingrad looked like in 1943.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255724401_058c6938ea_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Field Marshal Paulus surrendered in the basement of this house.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255724516_cb4ff0079c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a good embankment along the Volga.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254994547_aa4216a9bd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But the biggest impression was made by Volgograd roads. Of all the regional centers I've been to, Volgograd has the worst roads.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255724146_d5d711135c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A trip to the Lenin Canal is an hour of terrible shaking in a minibus, despite the fact that most of the way goes along a large highway, half consisting of potholes.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256472754_b06a8c6f69_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The climate is arid, there is almost a steppe around the city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254994167_edf09eff07_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In Volgograd, it is completely unjustifiable to construct underground passages even through small streets.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255926963_819fd0203e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Transport is mostly minibuses, although there are buses and trolleybuses, and there is even a metro tram - a tram that runs underground in the city center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256472434_14c766156b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The meme city of Uryupinsk is located in the Volgograd region, you can get there by bus, although it’s not close, it takes 5-6 hours.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256473189_558be17f9e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The slogan is a thing of the past.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255927183_76a0f3d7d4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Lantern with hammer and sickle.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256473454_c1a3243fb1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a monument to Lenin in the post office.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254994602_33165ab9b3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On the facade of the university there is a slogan: “Learn, learn, learn. Lenin”
<p/>

<p>
Look! Yulechka Suzumiya on the sign of a rock paraphernalia store. <i>There were waffles "Yulechka" that used Haruhi Suzumiya's iamge on the packaging.</i>
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256472939_17aec41dac_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Elista</h2>
<p>
It is unusual in the European part of Russia to come to a city where Asian-looking people live and profess Buddhism. Kalmykia can be said to be the westernmost region of Asia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256087531_fc50791e28_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Pagodas and stupas have been built throughout the city.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257131235_3de68e79df_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You can often see residents walking around the stupas in a circle and praying. And you don’t need to go to India or China!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256287733_7eaeb0d21f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And there are drums.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256835889_02cc13eadc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Kalmykia is formally one of the poorest regions of Russia, but Elista looks good. The example of <a href="../vladikavkaz">Ingushetia<a>, however, has already shown that GDP per capita and economic conditions in Russia do not always correlate.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257131070_2de58e9588_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The roads in the city are decent everywhere.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255357697_f01d87636e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Opposite the bus station there is a very good hotel for 1200 rubles per day.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256087406_28cc825eb7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Prices are low.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257782720_eb04b9d6b1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Traditional Russian art is present.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257131055_661c703494_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Stands with national patterns.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257486229_19cab1ece7_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257486284_18ab07478e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Lanterns too.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256288023_544c88fd0a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Bus stop.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256287943_d2845c8dcf_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In Kalmykia, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov was the president for a long time. The cult of his personality is impressive - probably in no other region are streets named after the head of the region during his lifetime, even in <a href="../chechnya">Chechnya</a> .
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256835914_d7c0a0a2e3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Ilyumzhinov is no longer the president of Kalmykia, but still heads the International Chess Federation. Therefore, chess tournaments are held in Elista, and there is also a “chess city”, as if the embodiment of Ostap Bender’s fantasy about New Vasyuki (real Vasyuki, let me remind you, is <a href="../kazan">Kozmodemyansk</a>).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256288153_18d46383cd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The scale of the chess city, of course, is far from cosmic.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256836184_f0615ca052_h.jpg"/>
<p>
By and large, this is a cottage community with a couple of restaurants.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256288113_061defe33c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
After two streets the city ends and the steppe begins.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256288203_740b725c6a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
All sorts of sculptural compositions with a chess theme are placed on the streets.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257131290_fe0f986021_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256087816_1fbb21b813_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And in the middle there is a chess palace.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256836044_d13d1de61a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You can also play a party in the central square.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256835994_1e7b965d4b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I've never seen such an appropriate name for a mobile phone store before.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256087881_4213be401f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Kalmykia is a large and sparsely populated steppe.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256087381_b9ba6e246e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Apart from Elista, there are essentially no cities there, only villages.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256087356_22613cf4c9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here's one, for example.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257130935_5b4d67417a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But this is more of a picture.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256087906_eb466a7427_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Sometimes you can see salt marshes along the road.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256087921_895e02418c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But mostly - the road and pillars. The road from Elista to Astrakhan is dozens of kilometers without a single settlement, without a single tree. Conducive to thinking about the eternal.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256087946_d0c12f9d18_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Astrakhan</h2>
<p>
Far, far in the south, among the vast lifeless steppes, there is a city where for some reason they are very fond of vulgar jokes.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256583729_d177a90469_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Astrakhan is the last large city on the Volga, for a long time it was actually the southernmost region of Russia, behind which Kalmyks and Dagestanis lived. The Astrakhan region is still sparsely populated; for the most part it is steppe.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256583954_31bbb8ee25_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The proximity of the Caucasus is felt here. Around the station there are authentic Dagestan canteens.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255835216_a28b91a0c5_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256037138_8139104195_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Many bus routes to the south, as well as trains towards Makhachkala and Baku. Here is a Eurolines bus going to <a href="../chechnya">Grozny</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255834906_4872f35f3b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And then the Nazis arrive.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256879390_6c85b06542_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A real village begins to the north of the station.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255835001_a1821fc9b0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Or, if you prefer, a cottage community.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256036883_a2e9bf68f3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A sheet left over from some factory was nailed to the wall of the house: work rules.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256036848_db1ebb6b33_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The quality of roads in this part of Astrakhan leaves much to be desired.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256878480_cb0cfad36c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Let's look at the beauty.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256878860_329b6e9202_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Astrakhan can easily be included in the top 10 most beautiful cities in Russia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256037458_2174fb8575_h.jpg"/>
<p>
What balconies!
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255106387_19d574b164_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And what a devastation it is in places.
<p/>

<p>
The world's largest selection of Astrakhan souvenirs is in Astrakhan.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255835421_eca5ac0e0e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
By the way, about souvenirs. Watermelons in Astrakhan turned out to be no cheaper than in Moscow; apparently, at the beginning of August their time had not yet come. Black caviar is not sold on every corner.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256879300_8611b59b1f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the main square you can jump on the fountains.

If Astrakhan were not so out of the way, a lot of people would come here.
