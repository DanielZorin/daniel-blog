<h1>Russia: Moscow</h1>
<i>8-23 September 2015</i>
<h2>Moscow</h2>
<p>
Many times I thought about writing about Moscow in the same style as about all other cities, but I didn’t know how to approach this, where to start. I saw too much of everything (although I photographed much less). But in September 2015, I had the opportunity to be a tourist in Moscow and record what I saw in a short period of time.

The most important discovery was this: if you are a tourist, then it is quite possible to live in Russia. If you are not pressed around the clock by Crimea, and Kiselev’s propaganda, you do not communicate with government institutions and officials, if you don’t care how deep the country will slide in a year or five years, you feel very cheerful. A simple comparison: many people really like to live in Thailand on the shores of the warm sea and eat cheap fruits, but for the locals everything is not so rosy, since revolutions occur there with the same frequency as in Ukraine, and in the very south several times a week something explodes. After the fall of the ruble, Russia became almost cheaper than Thailand in many respects. There are, of course, large numbers of Putin’s fans, but it’s not written on anyone’s forehead, and in real life (not on the Internet) Moscow residents are polite and friendly, although residents of other cities like to claim the opposite.

It’s best, of course, not to live with a Russian passport, so that the KGB doesn’t bother you at all. By the way, did you know that holders of blue passports of the United States of America are in a privileged position in Russia: they can stay on a tourist visa for 180 days, and not 30 or 90, like everyone else, and do not have a stay limit of 90 days every six months? If I were an American, I would go to Russia for a few months one summer.
The only thing that is still not cheap in Moscow is restaurants. Previously, a dish in an average restaurant cost 10-20 dollars, now it’s 5-10. I went to a Chinese restaurant to compare. Tasty, but not at all like what they cook in China. I found the website of another Chinese restaurant, where the menu looked as authentic as possible, but the prices there did not please me at all - three times more expensive than in China.

The caramelized fruit was a success, although the most popular small apples were missing.

In Moscow there is noticeably less advertising and huge signs in the center; the city no longer looks like Seoul or Hong Kong.

In this nook in Polyanka, where nothing had ever happened, they painted the heroes of Aqua Teen Hunger Force and a burger.

There are also a lot of taxis, usually bright yellow. Most have Yandex.taxi or GetTaxi logos. They say that prices have dropped significantly - previously, for less than 500 rubles, a taxi wouldn’t even go to the next door. However, the point of such a large number of taxis in Moscow, where there is an inexpensive metro, is still not very clear.

I didn’t see Nemtsov Bridge (the folk memorial on the place where Boris Nemtsov was killed) in March; I left just then. But it survived until September.

I mean the stupid fences that surround Red Square 90% of the time. This fence is completely meaningless, you can go to the other side, but you need to make a detour, otherwise Putin in the Kremlin will be unhappy.

They still sell "rubber pizza" on the ground floor. When I ate it regularly in 2007-2008, it cost 40-45 rubles. It was a golden time before the inflation spree caused by the 2008 crisis.

Only in Auchan, which I remember when it was called Ramstore, the design is constantly changing. This legendary place is the shopping center closest to Moscow State University. The only alternative is the fountains near the circus (Called "Ja", the short of "Jawaharlal Nehru Square"), where it is customary to drink strong drinks.

A visit to Moscow would be incomplete without a walk in the Kitay-gorod metro area - the only place with old narrow streets “like in Europe”.

The area around is unrecognizable. Then there was an almost wild yard, where ice slides were flooded in winter. Now it's a sports ground.

I was short on time, and I didn’t have time to go anywhere around the country. But I did visit one city outside the Moscow Ring Road - Korolyov, which starts immediately north of Moscow. There is a monument to Lenin in the center.

I was in Korolyov when I was 9 years old, at a chess tournament. There was no Internet then, I didn’t see a map of the Moscow region and didn’t know where I was going, so it seemed to me that this was some distant and unknown place.
