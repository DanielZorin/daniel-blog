<h1>Taiwan: Taipei, Hualien, Kaohsiung, Tainan, Chiayi, Taichung</h1>
<i>18-30 July 2015</i>
<h2>Taipei</h2>
<p>
Once upon a time, the island of Taiwan was the ancestral home of modern Filipinos and Indonesians, then it was colonized by the Chinese from the mainland. In the 17th century, the island managed to receive the name “beautiful” (Formosa) from the Portuguese, to be a colony of <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/tag/netherlands">The Netherlands</a>, and then for 40 years it was controlled by the supporters of the overthrown Ming dynasty. History repeated itself two hundred years later: first the island was colonized by the Japanese, taking it from the Chinese following the war in 1895, and after the defeat of Japan in 1945 and the civil war in China, opponents of the communist regime moved there, and they still rule the island. Like <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/tag/south korea">Korea</a>, Taiwan was ruled by dictators who brutally suppressed freedom, and democracy came only 30 years ago. It is curious that the Chinese National Party (KMT) has not disappeared, but is still one of the leading political forces, although in 2016 they lost the elections.

Taiwan is an unrecognized state with a unique status: formally they claim the entire territory of another state. You can only recognize one of the Chinese governments - Beijing or Taipei, and 90% of countries, of course, recognize Beijing, although about 20 countries that are very far from China recognize Taiwan. In Taiwan itself, of course, no one seriously believes in the possibility of conquering back all of China. The dispute is rather between supporters of unification with the mainland on some terms (in Beijing they want it to be like with Hong Kong, but in Taiwan not so much) and supporters of independence. Initially, Taiwan called itself nothing less than the “Republic of China”; under this name its representatives even worked at the UN until 1971 instead of representatives of mainland China. Now even the visa says “Republic of China - Taiwan,” but they tried to join the UN simply as the “Republic of Taiwan.”

Relations with Beijing are gradually improving, in particular, relatively recently, residents of the PRC were allowed to travel to Taiwan for tourism purposes (at the airport, a whole crowd of Chinese stood in line for control with some kind of special questionnaires in addition to passports). There are direct flights from many Chinese cities, although the most frequent flight connection is still with Hong Kong. Taiwanese tourists are quite privileged - they do not need visas to most developed countries, even to the USA, Canada and Australia. Interestingly, for visa-free entry to the USA, Schengen, etc. Taiwanese not only need a passport, but also their ID card. The fact is that since Taiwan formally claims all of China, any Chinese is, technically, a citizen of Taiwan. Therefore, only the owner of an ID card who has all the rights in Taiwan (in particular, the right to work) is considered a Taiwanese, and this card is not issued to just everyone easily.

The controversial status did not prevent Taiwan from becoming one of the most developed and successful countries in the world. Try going to <a href="http://numbeo.com">numbeo.com</a> and find a city where Local Purchasing Power is higher than Taipei! I did not find. This means that although the absolute value of salaries in Taiwan is lower than, say, in the United States, you can live much better on this salary, because Taiwan is really cheap. I would say that prices for food, travel, hotels are only 30 percent higher than on the mainland, and the average salary in Taipei is about $2,000 per month.

Apart from one skyscraper that was the tallest building in the entire world for six years, Taipei doesn't look stunning. Typical residential area.

Taiwanese temples are visually very different from Chinese ones, but they are very similar to the Chinese temples that can be found in Chinatowns in different countries of Southeast Asia. Chinese temples probably once looked like this before they were destroyed in the 1960s and 1970s.

Although nothing was purposefully destroyed in Taiwan, and there was no war, there is practically no old architecture (as in <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/391172.html">Pingyao</a>, for example) on the island. There are rare remains.

Taiwan and China are supposedly rivals, but now they are becoming more and more similar to each other. When China has excellent roads, high-speed trains, skyscrapers, civilization and wealth, it becomes like Taiwan.

Many refugees from different parts of China settled in Taiwan after the war, so you can find dishes from any region, but there are also unique features. For example, this dish (“age”) is sold only in one suburb of Taipei.

Ice cream in Taipei is very diverse. Firstly, there is “Taiwanese ice cream” (shaved ice) - crushed ice with filling.

The Japanese colonialists also greatly influenced Taiwan, and unlike Korea, there is no deep-rooted hostility towards them. More anime figures are sold in Taiwan than in any other country in the world (except Japan itself I guess). Your favorite heroes look at you from posters on the streets and in underground passages. Here is Usagi giving punishment in the name of the moon:

In addition to fast trains, regular trains that look like a subway also run between cities in Taiwan. I read that it’s the same in Japan - you can travel the whole country on such a “metro train,” albeit with a huge number of changes.

Off the coast of Kaohsiung there is an unusual Qijin Island. It is very long and narrow, located along the shore, so that it fences off an equally long and narrow bay. It used to be a peninsula, but the connection to the main land was razed and replaced with a tunnel. The most common way to get there is by ferry (the tunnel is at the far end of the island far from the city center). Ferry and ferry terminal:

Ferries run non-stop during the day, every 10 minutes, but there is still a huge queue. Price is 25 yuan ($0.8). It is especially interesting to note that the year is 104 in Taiwan: the calendar dates back to 1911, the year of the revolution and the founding of the Republic of China.

<h2>Tainan</h2>

"Taipei" simply means "northern Taiwan". If there is a city in the north, there must be one in the south, and it is called Tainan. This was the capital before Taipei. There's also Taichung (in the middle) and Taitung (on the east coast).

<h2>Chiayi</h2>
<p>
If you look at the bus schedule to Alishan Park from Taipei, at first you are surprised at their inconvenience: they leave at 11 pm and arrive at 4 am. In fact, such a schedule is not accidental, but so that you can be on the top of the mountain exactly at dawn. I was not ready for such sacrifices, so I took a bus from the nearest city of Chiayi at around 7 am.

Previously, you could get right to the top via a narrow-gauge railway, which was an attraction in itself. However, several years ago it was damaged by a typhoon, and now you can only get to the top by bus. Trains run within the park itself. There are several departures to the observation deck early in the morning at dawn, and the rest of the time you can ride through the park, which I was planning to do, but it didn’t work out.

After some time the rain stopped. The plan was to go down and then walk around the park and take the train. As soon as we walked about a kilometer and a half down, the real heavy rain began. There was nowhere to hide on the bare road in the forest. The umbrella, of course, saved the day - you can squat under it, hugging the backpack with the camera, and avoid getting your upper clothes wet. But when the boots were completely flooded with water, there was nothing to lose. When we got to the bus station, the rain stopped. All that was left was to dry off at the nearest hotel and go down.

At least I had time to try a local signature dish. It seems that this is ordinary chicken with rice, but in fact it is exotic meat - turkey.

<h2>Taichung</h2>
<p>
The flight to Hong Kong was from Taichung Airport, which some low-cost airlines use as an alternative to Taipei Airport. Therefore, for one day I found myself in this city, which is not particularly rich in attractions.

In general, not far from Taichung there is a famous place - “Sun Moon lake”, but one day was not enough for me to get there. I had to limit myself to the city.

To celebrate our last day in such a wonderful country as Taiwan, we went to the night market. The market is located along the road, where traffic is not even blocked.

The main feature of this restaurant is that they offer spicy soup... ice cream! At the end of the hall there is a box with several types of ice cream, and you can take out unlimited scoops.
