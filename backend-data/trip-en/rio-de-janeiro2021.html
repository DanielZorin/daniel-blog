<h1>Brazil: Rio de Janiero</h1>

<h2>Rio de Janeiro</h2>
<p>
Rio de Janeiro, the crystal dream of my childhood. <a href="http://goo.gl/HA41rn">Last time</a> I lived on a shoestring in the city center, but now after the depreciation of the real there is a better option - Copacabana beach. The beach itself is not particularly good (what else can you expect from a beach in the center of a large city?), but there is always life there, including Sunday (the day Brazil goes silent), as well as inexpensive housing: you can rent an entire apartment for $20.

<p>
Copacabana consists of apartment buildings with 10-15 floors, some of them are hotels, but most are ordinary residential buildings.

There are two favelas near Copacabana: Babilonia at the northern end and Cantagalo at the south. Babilonia is visible between the buildings of the first line.

At an angle to Copacabana behind the cape, Ipanema Beach begins, turning into Leblon Beach. This is a more expensive area, especially Leblon - it's hard to find anything under $50 there. The beach is less crowded and cleaner than Copacabana. In the distance on the hillsides is the favela Vidigal, and on the other side of the hill is Rocinha, the largest favela.

In 2016, the fourth line of the Rio de Janeiro metro opened, which is essentially a direct continuation of the second. The first three stations cover Ipanema, then after a long stretch one station near Rocinha, and after another very long stretch a station in the Tijuca area, which previously had to be reached by bus through tunnels.

The historic center of Rio de Janeiro is considered a relatively dangerous area. It’s better not to walk there on weekends, because almost everything is closed. On a weekday it’s basically normal in crowded places. There is a lot to see here, you can imagine what it was like here in the 1930s, during the time of Ostap Bender, when Copacabana was still a village on the outskirts, and the main streets of the city were not inferior to the best cities in the world in terms of the splendor of their buildings. The sharp growth of favelas and crime began in the 40s and 50s, so in the 30s it should have been quite good.

Rio de Janeiro train station. To the right on the hill is Providencia - the very first favela in Brazil. It was formed back in the 1890s, when soldiers returning from the “War of Canudos” (the suppression of an uprising in the state of Bahia) settled on the hill. "Favela" is the name of a shrub with acrid sap that grows in northeastern Brazil, where the uprising was.

I had already been to <a href="http://goo.gl/B8AFpR">the favelas of Rio de Janeiro in 2013</a> and promised to go there again then. And so, I fulfilled my promise. Not that much has changed over the years. Groups involved in drug trafficking are still based in the favelas, and the government periodically tries to clean them up there with gunfire in all directions (at the beginning of May 2021, 25 people died in one large shootout). I didn’t go to the northern part of Rio, but I did visit the south, where the largest but less dangerous favelas are.
<p/>

As I already mentioned in the story about Copacabana, there are two favelas nearby on the northern and southern edges. I was just in the southern one, it’s called Pavão-Pavãozinho, or Cantagalo (after the name of the mountain). In 2013, it seemed that apartment buildings would be built instead, but the favela has not gone away.

The largest favela in Rio de Janeiro is called Rocinha. It is located among the hills between Ipanema and Tijuca. The main road is built through tunnels, but there is also a road through the entire favela, which is also served by public transport; you can arrive by regular city bus.

To see Rio de Janeiro from the water, you can take a ferry from Plaza XV November. The most common ferries go to Niteroi on the other side of the bay, where I was <a href="http://goo.gl/DCyTme">in 2012</a>. This time I went on a longer journey to Paquetá Island, I sailed about an hour deep into the bay. The fare is inexpensive, about 6 reais.

A huge crowd got off the ferry and quickly dispersed. Then I walked around the island, and there were few people everywhere. I don't know where everyone went. In general, there are a lot of hotels here, people seem to come here for the weekend, to relax from the noise of the big city on the beach (and I just arrived on Saturday morning).

Rio de Janeiro is probably the most picturesque of the world's megacities. Here, quite high hills rise among the densely populated central areas, and also next to the sea. It is the landscapes and panoramas of Rio (and not the architecture) that are included in the World Heritage List. There are two famous high viewpoints in the city center: the Jesus Statue and the Sugar Loaf. But there is another way to see Rio from above, although it is not guaranteed - a flight through Santos Dumont Airport. This airport is located in the very center of the city on the bay. Most domestic flights fly through it rather than through the distant and inconvenient Galeão. To have a good view, you need to guess which side to sit on. If you're lucky, you can see the entire city center and more. This is more likely to happen if you sit on the right side when boarding.

I've flown to or from Rio de Janeiro six times, two of which were after sunset, so it was dark. The first time, I checked in late and was sitting on the left side, but suddenly the plane made a U-turn over downtown and Sugar Loaf at the end before landing.

Traditional review of a supermarket in Brazil. There are plenty of grocery stores here, including European chains such as Dia and Carrefour. In the city center there are usually smaller stores, and on the outskirts there are always a bunch of hypermarkets. This is the Pão de Açucar chain, I would say that it is an analogue of Russian Perekrestok in terms of price level and assortment. Prices in Brazilian reals, 1 USD = 5.3 BRL, 1 BRL = 14 RUB
