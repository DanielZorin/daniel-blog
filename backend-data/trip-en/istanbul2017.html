<h1>Turkey: Istanbul</h1>
<i>3 April 2017</i>
<h2>Istanbul</h2>
<p>
Istanbul is an excellent place for a transfer, many long-distance flights, no visa required, cheap, easy to get to the city. The last time I was in Turkey was at the beginning of 2014. Since then, considerable changes have occurred in the country: a coup attempt and a halving of the local currency (it fell even more in 2018). Portraits of the national leader hang at every step.

For one day, the route is more than standard: Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, etc., especially since Alena was in Istanbul for the first time.

There are noticeably many tourists from Muslim countries in Istanbul, fortunately many of them do not need a visa to come to Turkey either.

In the evening the plane flew over the center of Istanbul. You can see the Golden Horn and even the mosque.
