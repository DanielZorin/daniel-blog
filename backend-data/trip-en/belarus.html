<h1>Belarus: Minsk, Babruisk, Mogilev</h1>
<i>9-10 April 2012</i>
<h2>Minsk</h2>
<p>
Belarus is a very calm and cultural country. Rumors of a total dictatorship are greatly exaggerated. In any case, if there is a dictatorship in Belarus, then even more so in Russia. After all, in Russia there are ten police officers at each metro station, half the streets are patrolled, as if there is a war going on. In Minsk, police officers can be seen at the train station (two at the entrance) and in the metro (one at the turnstiles: they probably appeared after the terrorist attack in 2011). Opposition rallies are banned here - well, it’s not just here. In elections, the president receives a lot of votes - in our country, too, Putin will gain a lot without fraud, and in the past he got even more. The political culture may not be up to high American standards, but let's not forget that this is a post-Soviet country. (<i>(This text did no age well - greetings from 2023</i>) <br/>
Let's move on to the details. Belarus is officially bilingual, so signs can be seen in both Russian and Belarusian. At the same time, you can only hear the Belarusian language at an opposition rally or on TV: some of the news reports are in Belarusian. Belarusians are very fond of the letter y with a "shortener".

<p>
Traffic lights advise you to be careful, and some wish you happiness.

Prices by Moscow standards are very low. The exchange rate of the Belarusian ruble is approximately the same as that of the Indonesian rupiah, so further prices are in Russian rubles. Gasoline - 24 rubles (yes, this is a country that buys oil from Russia). Metro ticket - 6 rubles. I bought a book at the store for 30 rubles. Half a liter of cola - 15 rubles. Furniture is several times cheaper than in Russia. There is only one minus - the average salary in Belarus is about 6,000 rubles, and with it these prices will not seem so low.

The Soviet style is constantly visible in the design. The emblem of the Ocean fish store could have looked like this, but here they took English words. By the way, the word “universam” can be seen very often in Belarus. Moreover, in every corner store, even somewhere in Bobruisk, you can pay with a bank card (how often do you see this in Moscow?).

<p>
There are social advertisements throughout the city, mostly of patriotic content. Here are children cleaning the streets so that Belarus continues to hold the title of the cleanest place on the globe.

<p>
And here is an almost senile example.
<p/>

<p>
When sightseeing in the city, I relied on the advice of such a reputable source of information as lurkmore.ru. Here is the main McDonald's of Minsk, a place of cultural recreation for the capital's residents.

<p>
Here is Troitskoye, a piece of old buildings in the center.
<p/>

<p>
Storozhevskaya street. What is interesting here is completely unclear.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257191699_4abeae93e8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Perhaps, not very far from it, on the wall there is a picture with an unrealistic formula for combinations of k by n with a half-painted cap at the root sign and missing summation indices.
<p/>

<p>
There is also the National Library, but its photo will not be here, and instead there will be a photo of the Palace of Culture of the Tractor Plant, yeah.
<p/>

<p>
There is Vaupshasova Street nearby, a place that rivals Kapotnya in terms of the grimness of its atmosphere. I did not dare to go further than this point, because the smell of burning was too obvious.
<p/>

<p>
Bobruiskaya Street leads us east, to the legendary city.

<h2>Bobruisk</h2>
<p>
Once upon a time I dreamed of getting here: <br/>
<i>
I am in Bobruisk, like a bird in the sky. <br/>
I'm in Bobruisk, I forgot what fear means! <br/>
</i>
And here it is, the city of my dreams!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255934516_bab870e46c_h.jpg"/>

<p>
Bobruisk has one foot in the bright Soviet past.
<p/>

<p>
And the other - in a bright democratic future. A bright, boldly decorated store.
<p/>

<p>
Biker bar.
<p/>

<p>
Not far from it there is a country road and a cart with a horse.
<p/>

<p>
The modernist building was painted in such rich colors relatively recently.
<p/>

<p>
Excellent street sign.
<p/>

<p>
There is an old fortress in Bobruisk, built shortly before the war of 1812. At first glance, these are nondescript ruins.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256136088_49613b8f99_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But you can go inside and admire the centuries-old brickwork and wander through the underground tunnels. The tunnels are completely dark; you can navigate by photographing the path with a flash.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255934651_f6592fe484_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Unfortunately, there are few tourists here, and the fortress is not very well looked after. Some buildings seem to be being tidied up, but one, the most easily accessible from the road, is in complete chaos.
<p/>

<p>
By the way, Bobruisk stands on the Berezina River, the same one where Napoleon suffered a crushing defeat in December 1812.
<p/>

<p>
Overall the city is very pleasant. Silence, grace, purity, tranquility.

<h2>Mogilev</h2>
<p>
Life is in full swing in Mogilev.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257489075_99bda064ff_h.jpg"/>

<p>
The house was painted here, almost like in Madrid.
<p/>

<p>
They don't skimp on exquisite compliments here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256446146_0252c529a0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here they promote traffic rules with huge signs.
<p/>

<p>
And supermarkets of the same chain are numbered. Here is Perekrestok-2, and a little further - Perekrestok-3.
<p/>

<p>
Mogilev is located on the Dnieper, like Kyiv.
<p/>

<p>
I can’t ignore the mention of books by my favorite authors.
<p/>

<p>
Error on street sign.

<p>
Overdose of social advertising.
<p/>

<p>
It's time to leave. At the station we are escorted by a bronze conductor.
