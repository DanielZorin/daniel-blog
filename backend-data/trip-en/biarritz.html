<h1>France: Biarritz, Hendaye, Saint Jean de Luz</h1>

<h2>Biarritz</h2>
<p>
In Biarritz, I walked from the airport to the city center for the first time. The funny thing is that I used the airport as a bus station. The fact is that the bus from the French border goes to Bayonne without stopping in the center of Biarritz, and stops only at the train station and at the airport, and the airport is closer to the center.

<p>
All the other houses in Biarritz look so that the owners can only be kindly envied.

<h2>Hendaye</h2>
<p>
Hendaye is located on the border with Spain. The Spanish and French railways meet here. International rail traffic is much inferior in intensity to domestic rail traffic, although there have been no borders for many years. In most cases, you need to go to the border station and change there to a train from another country. There are either no through trains (as on the border of Spain with France in Hendaye), or they are rare and very expensive. The border looks like this.

<p>
The station is typically French, like in <a href="../toulouse">Narbonne</a>.

In France there are Basque patriots, Basque flags and koturs of the Basque Star hang. Even in souvenir shops. Even at a crossroads. Unlike Spain, they do not demand secession.

<p>
The signs are also duplicated in Basque.
