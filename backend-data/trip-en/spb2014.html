<h1>Russia: Saint Petersburg, Priozersk, Shlisselburg</h1>
<i>5-9 June 2014</i>
<h2>Saint Petersburg</h2>
<p>
Arriving in St. Petersburg for the seventh time, I set out to visit all the places I had never been before, and those were mostly the outskirts. One of the most interesting outskirts is Kanonersky Island. This island on the shore of the bay is located between several factories and cargo docks, but for some reason they decided to build several residential buildings there. Moreover, until 1981, the island could only be reached by ferry, which made it probably the most inconvenient place to live in St. Petersburg (on par with Kronstadt, which also had no road at that time). Now you can get to the island through a tunnel, including on foot, although it is a bit difficult, since the pedestrian path is very narrow. The easiest way to get there is by bus from the Baltiyskaya metro station in 30 minutes.
<p/>

<p>
The first thing you see on Kanonersky Island is the shipyard on Gutuevsky Island opposite.
<p/>

<p>
This is the cargo port of St. Petersburg (the passenger port is at <a href="../karelia">Vasilievsky Island</a>).

<p>
The residential area on Kanonersky Island looks something like this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256140139_490da0b903_o.jpg">
<p>
There is one microdistrict of newer houses.
<p/>

<p>
I went into a grocery store, and a song from the TV series “Gangster Petersburg” was playing. Then I heard it several more times on other outskirts of the city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255392836_5374e4b79a_o.jpg">
<p>
Houses here still have addresses like “Kanonersky Island, house X.”
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255392746_a63de40211_o.jpg">
<p>
There is a beach opposite the houses. There are much fewer people here than near Peter and Paul fortress, but it’s much closer to get here than to <a href="../vyborg">Sestroretsk</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256436265_9dc9b735bd_o.jpg">
<p>
There is an incredible number of garages on the island.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255595988_85330ba5e5_o.jpg">
<p>
Behind the residential area there is a whole city of garages. Probably not only locals park their cars in it, because it’s hard to believe that there are so many cars here.
<p/>

<p>
There is a wasteland on the southern third of the island.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254660782_b188861dae_o.jpg">
<p>
There is a story that in the 90s the corpses of victims of gang violence were thrown out here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255596303_97ac818672_o.jpg">
<p>
You can walk along a narrow spit to the very edge of the island.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255393146_6ac7d4e222_o.jpg">
<p>
Across the strait there is another small island, on which some kind of destroyed barn still stands.
<p/>

There is an aeration station on the northern part of the island.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256436800_a1838ba927_o.jpg">
<p>
And also a ship repair yard, where you can’t go. It’s funny that on the wall of the tunnel at the exit to the island there is a sign that says “photography is prohibited”; it’s completely unclear why.

Since last time, four districts remained unknown: Krasnoselsky, Kirovsky, Frunzensky and Kolpinsky. I got to know Krasnoselsky a little when I arrived at Pulkovo airport. The current airport is good, but next to the fence you can still see the old airport, which was extremely poor and looked like the airport of <a href="../sakhalin">Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk</a> .
<p/>

<p>
If you come to St. Petersburg for the first time through the airport, you can get a culture shock from the difference between expectation and reality, arriving from the airport to the Moskovskaya metro station. However, I think very few tourists get here by plane, since the train is cheaper and more convenient.
<p/>

In the Kirovsky district there is a factory of the same name (formerly Putilovsky).

It was here (Narva Gate Square) that the shooting of the rally on Bloody Sunday of 1905 took place.

There is also a monument to Kirov, after whom the area is named. Kanonersky Island also belongs to the Kirovsky district.

Kupchino is the most non-tourist place.
<p/>

<p>
But if you want to move to St. Petersburg, you will most likely live in a place like this, and not at all in the beautiful historical center.

For this occasion, there is a monument to soldier Schweik near the metro.

But the lists of apartments are exactly the same. It's funny to see three-digit apartment numbers here.

Kolpino is the “butyrate capital of Russia”, a working class area. Quite unexpectedly, Empire style buildings appeared here.

The Devyatkino metro station is notable for the fact that it is the only station located in the Leningrad region.

In the remaining time, I ran through several monuments to Lenin. This is the first monument (of those that have survived to this day). Year 1926. Note the non-standard lettering and pose.

Ignite, but remember 282! <i>282 is the infamous article of the criminal code banning hate speech. 99% of cases with this article used to be agains Russian ultra-nationalists who badmouthed migrants. In Russian hate speech is called literally "igniting the hatred and malice".</i>

If in Moscow most of the advertisements on poles are registration and loans, then in St. Petersburg we see hotels and prostitutes.

It is clear why they say “paradnaya” here and not “podyezd” <i>People from SPB use several local words that are different from Moscow and other citis. One of them is "paradnaya", meaning an entrance to the multi-apartment house. This word literally means "the parade entrance", as opposed to the regular word "podyezd" that means literally "place where youa arrive"</i>.
