<h1>Russia: Saint Petersburg, Priozersk, Shlisselburg</h1>
<i>5-9 June 2014</i>
<h2>Saint Petersburg</h2>
<p>
Arriving in St. Petersburg for the seventh time, I set out to visit all the places I had never been before, and those were mostly the outskirts. One of the most interesting outskirts is Kanonersky Island. This island on the shore of the bay is located between several factories and cargo docks, but for some reason they decided to build several residential buildings there. Moreover, until 1981, the island could only be reached by ferry, which made it probably the most inconvenient place to live in St. Petersburg (on par with Kronstadt, which also had no road at that time). Now you can get to the island through a tunnel, including on foot, although it is a bit difficult, since the pedestrian path is very narrow. The easiest way to get there is by bus from the Baltiyskaya metro station in 30 minutes.
<p/>

<p>
The first thing you see on Kanonersky Island is the shipyard on Gutuevsky Island opposite.
<p/>

<p>
This is the cargo port of St. Petersburg (the passenger port is at <a href="../karelia">Vasilievsky Island</a>).
<p/>

<p>
The residential area on Kanonersky Island looks something like this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256140139_1ad10bdb06_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is one microdistrict of newer houses.
<p/>

<p>
I went into a grocery store, and a song from the TV series “Gangster Petersburg” was playing. Then I heard it several more times on other outskirts of the city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255392836_cfe2953af4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Houses here still have addresses like “Kanonersky Island, house X.”
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255392746_85df8df54a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a beach opposite the houses. There are much fewer people here than near Peter and Paul fortress, but it’s much closer to get here than to <a href="../vyborg">Sestroretsk</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256436265_079cb9fe74_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is an incredible number of garages on the island.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255595988_0787b133e4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Behind the residential area there is a whole city of garages. Probably not only locals park their cars in it, because it’s hard to believe that there are so many cars here.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256139904_39f5894efa_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a wasteland on the southern third of the island.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254660782_76e8e40fab_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a story that in the 90s the corpses of victims of gang violence were thrown out here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255596303_9b74453de3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You can walk along a narrow spit to the very edge of the island.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255393146_0f182affaf_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Across the strait there is another small island, on which some kind of destroyed barn still stands.
<p/>

<p>
There is an aeration station on the northern part of the island.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256436800_d74328ba7e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And also a ship repair yard, where you can’t go. It’s funny that on the wall of the tunnel at the exit to the island there is a sign that says “photography is prohibited”; it’s completely unclear why.
<p/>

Since last time, four districts remained unknown: Krasnoselsky, Kirovsky, Frunzensky and Kolpinsky. I got to know Krasnoselsky a little when I arrived at Pulkovo airport. The current airport is good, but next to the fence you can still see the old airport, which was extremely poor and looked like the airport of <a href="../sakhalin">Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk</a> .
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255392256_06a54d6e2a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
If you come to St. Petersburg for the first time through the airport, you can get a culture shock from the difference between expectation and reality, arriving from the airport to the Moskovskaya metro station. However, I think very few tourists get here by plane, since the train is cheaper and more convenient.
<p/>

<p>
In the Kirovsky district there is a factory of the same name (formerly Putilovsky).
<p/>

<p>
It was here (Narva Gate Square) that the shooting of the rally on Bloody Sunday of 1905 took place.

<p>
There is also a monument to Kirov, after whom the area is named. Kanonersky Island also belongs to the Kirovsky district.
<p/>

<p>
Kupchino is the most non-tourist place.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257021593_85a086aa9b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But if you want to move to St. Petersburg, you will most likely live in a place like this, and not at all in the beautiful historical center.
<p/>

Jaroslav Hašek Street.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256140634_780961814b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
For this occasion, there is a monument to soldier Schweik near the metro.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257863995_1ad0ea3c59_h.jpg"/>
<p>
New trams are running in Kupchino.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255393731_f3c0e8e7e5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
They give out free books.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256140659_1535c067e1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The street signs are not the same as in the center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254661572_36cf8be8f8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But the lists of apartments are exactly the same. It's funny to see three-digit apartment numbers here.
<p/>

Kolpino is the “butyrate capital of Russia”, a working class area. Quite unexpectedly, Empire style buildings appeared here.

In Kolpino there is the Izhora plant, which occupies half of the city’s territory.

<p>
Monument in honor of sister cities. It’s interesting that there used to be a monument to Lenin on this pedestal, but for some reason it was demolished in 1952.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255394071_927229f2a8_h.jpg"/>

The Devyatkino metro station is notable for the fact that it is the only station located in the Leningrad region.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254661392_7fdeeb74be_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are also buses going north from here.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255596713_c736daef30_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the remaining time, I ran through several monuments to Lenin. This is the first monument (of those that have survived to this day). Year 1926. Note the non-standard lettering and pose.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257863560_71489c597b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a historical place nearby.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256435970_f4c5c038de_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is Elizarovskaya metro station. There is also a cool shopping center in the Mayakovsky style. The inside looks uninteresting.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256139419_a321776919_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Factory "Red Vyborzhets". In general, there are a lot of old brick factories in St. Petersburg, a paradise for industrial lovers.
<p/>

Somewhere here they were going to build the scandalous Okhta Center.

Lanskaya station. Lenin’s last safe house was located in this house, from here he went towards Smolny on October 25, 1917 to stage the coup.

There are still a lot of interesting <a href="../petersburg">inscriptions and signs in St. Petersburg</a>. It's a pleasure to walk around the city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254661342_6501115b8c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are very strange advertisements on Nevsky.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257020988_e7fbd47455_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The inscription is in pre-revolutionary spelling.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256094437_b931b955d8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It seems to me that this advertisement has been hanging here for 30 years.

Ignite, but remember 282! <i>282 is the infamous article of the criminal code banning hate speech. 99% of cases with this article used to be agains Russian ultra-nationalists who badmouthed migrants. In Russian hate speech is called literally "igniting the hatred and malice".</i>

If in Moscow most of the advertisements on poles are registration and loans, then in St. Petersburg we see hotels and prostitutes.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256437115_2b92ecaad3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Advertising of prostitutes is everywhere here. It’s strange that they don’t hand out business cards like in China.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257021188_88f65d3829_h.jpg"/>
<p>
They are trying to balance popular advertising with social advertising.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257021063_2df6481548_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Posters with photographs of exotic countries were hung around the metro.
<p/>

<p>
Funny poster on the train about debts. It is not clear why debts for gas were singled out; in my opinion, such punishments follow debts for any public services.
<p/>

On this trip I almost didn’t walk around the center; I mostly passed through it in transit. I only walked along Nevsky Prospect once.

It is clear why they say “paradnaya” here and not “podyezd” <i>People from SPB use several local words that are different from Moscow and other citis. One of them is "paradnaya", meaning an entrance to the multi-apartment house. This word literally means "the parade entrance", as opposed to the regular word "podyezd" that means literally "place where youa arrive"</i>.

<h2>Priozersk</h2>
<p>
Not very far from Priozersk is Putin's dacha and the Ozero cooperative. The landscapes are purely Karelian; it’s quite a short drive to the administrative border of Karelia.

<p>
The main attraction of Priozersk is the Swedish fortress.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256665536_98f6f4d7ad_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Entrance costs only 30 rubles.

<p>
Across the river from the fortress, near the buildings of the so-called “new fortress”, built several centuries later, is a sanatorium. At the entrance to it, among the fir trees, there is a monument to Lenin, a gray copy of the monument standing near the platform of <a href="../vyborg">Tarkhovka</a>.
<p/>

<p/>
