<h1>Turkey: Fethiye, Ölüdeniz</h1>
<i>9-10 April 2022</i>
<h2>Fethiye</h2>
<p>
One weekend I went for a couple of days to Fethiye - a city on the coast a few hours drive west of Antalya. It belongs to the neighboring province of Mugla.
<p/>

<p>
Fethiye turned out to be a rather cozy town, built up mainly with three-story houses.
<p/>

<p>
In Kemer there are 1-2 floors, in Antalya there are many, and in Fethiye there are exactly three.
<p/>

<p>
Even here, far from the embankment, there are also three floors.
<p/>

<p>
Got a hotel room in the attic.

"Monument" to Ataturk. The picture was taken with a low resolution, as a result the pixels are visible.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52037594485_31ebb886c7_o.jpg">
<p>
Portraits of Ataturk are placed along the entire embankment. He managed to be photographed in all sorts of poses and costumes, so there is a portrait of Ataturk for every situation. Here he is in a top hat, like Pushkin.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52037124773_b1ff5c5bc6_o.jpg">
<p>
He walks like a movie hero, with everything exploding behind him.
<p/>

<p>
All the busts were placed in one row, and you know which one is the highest.

The ruins of a fortress are on this hill, but it's closed, and there are also angry dogs there.

<p>
The road between Antalya and Fethiye, passing inland, is no less picturesque than the road along the coast.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52037071881_9af750cb1f_o.jpg">
<p>
You can see quite high mountains.

<h2>Ölüdeniz</h2>
<p>
The Lycian Way begins in Fethiye, and I was able to walk a small but one of its most beautiful sections. It starts in the village of Kayakoy in the mountains a few kilometers south of Fethiye.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52036034712_a2846a3bd8_o.jpg">

<p>
Kayaköy is now a small village. You can get here by minibus once an hour.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52037328339_b8dba2ca4c_o.jpg">
<p>
But once it was much larger, and now most of the houses are destroyed.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52037328299_f60e1c9544_o.jpg">
<p>
The fact is that previously it was a village with a predominantly Greek population, but after the First World War and the creation of the Turkish Republic, there was an exchange of populations between Turkey and Greece, as a result of which the village was empty.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52036035037_dca78a2536_o.jpg">
<p>
Now the whole large area on the hill is a picturesque ruin.

Rising higher, you can admire more and more views of the abandoned city.

Finally they disappear from sight and the forest begins.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52036034582_96c7844890_o.jpg">
<p>
From the top you can see gorgeous coastal landscapes.

The road turned out to be quite difficult, and several times I lost my way and went the wrong way, and then I had to go down the rocks carefully.

This is one of the most famous and picturesque beaches in Turkey - Ölüdeniz.

The bottom is also beautiful, but still not as epic.

You can go through the mountains, which can be seen in the distance, to the butterfly canyon, this is left for next time, since there was little strength after the hike.

<p>
There is little space near the coast, so it goes far up, and the bulk of the hotels are a few kilometers from the beach at the top.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52037592610_0946100658_o.jpg">

The atmosphere is reminiscent of Thailand.

<p>
Here people fly paragliders. It also turned out that near Ölüdeniz there is a cable car to a neighboring mountain, which opened quite recently (it’s not even marked on the Maps.me map yet). I need to go next time to.
