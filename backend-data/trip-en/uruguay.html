<h1>Uruguay: Montevideo, Colonia del Sacramento</h1>
<i>5-7 January 2013</i>
<h2>Montevideo</h2>
<p>
Everyone loves to photograph the central square of Montevideo with the Artigas monument from one angle, but few people know that if you turn 180 degrees, then right ahead there will be an ugly building, similar to a Soviet research institute, with a bunch of asymmetrically hung air conditioners.

<p>
A culture shock awaited me in Montevideo. There are tourists here! Almost like in Europe: you walk along the main street, surrounded by shops with souvenirs, groups of tourists speaking different languages. There are many tourists from Russia. In Brazil, there are no foreign tourists at all; even in Rio, outside the beach and the statue of Jesus, you will not hear any language other than Portuguese. Uruguay is full of people coming for 1-2 days from Buenos Aires by ferry.

The bus station has a funny logo with three X's.

<p>
Antique cars drive around the city. In general, they don’t strive for technical innovations here. For example, cards with a magnetic stripe are still in use in stores; sellers all the time pedantically asked me for a passport for verification.

<p>
They love antiquity here; in several squares in the center you can buy old license plates, street signs, coins and other antiques.

Uruguayans love to express themselves extensively about politics on their walls.

<p>
And chew on the rules in detail: “Don’t throw garbage, keep the environment clean.”

<p>
The symbol of the Uruguayan peso (as well as the Argentinean one) is the dollar sign, which, if you’re not used to it, leads to confusion.
<p/>

<p>
Thresholds are decorated with tiles.

Boxes at the port.

<p>
I climbed into some abandoned building. The floors are evenly covered with chewing gum.

<p>
The bottom is flooded, garbage floats in the water, just like in the favelas of Rio.

<p>
As in Brazil and Argentina, bookstores in Uruguay are held in high esteem; they resemble palaces.

Typical house number.

<p>
The design of signs with street names here seems to be left to local residents. Therefore, you can walk along one street, and all the houses will have different signs.

In the center the main style is:

<p>
Or this:

<p>
There is also a relief option.

<p>
The main pastime of local residents is to sit on the embankment and drink mate. Uruguayans always carry a thermos and a cup with them.

You can take out the sun loungers and enjoy.

<h2>Colonia del Sacramento</h2>
<p>
In Colonia I treated myself to a beach holiday after a long journey through Brazil: sun, beach, unlimited meat, wine and the famous sunset on the beach.
<p/>

<p>
Colonia is known as a museum city.
<p/>

<p>
To be fair, I note that the museum is small, only a couple of streets wide and about 5-6 in length. But the museum has a lot of vintage cars. If you're lucky, you can see them in motion.

<p>
I’m afraid you won’t see this car in motion anymore.
<p/>

<p>
The center is also characterized by lanterns...
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256030541_3196e6aa26_h.jpg"/>
<p>
...and tile signs.
<p/>

<p>
The house numbers are designed in a similar style.

<p>
Outside the center of Colonia there are apartment buildings and even slums near the river bank.
<p/>

<p>
Abandoned houses.

<p>
The cemetery in Colonia consists of pompous crypts, similar to Recoleta in Buenos Aires.
<p/>

<p>
Urns are made from barrels cut into the side.

In the evening, the main attraction is to sit on the banks of the Rio de la Plata and watch the sunset and the fishermen who continue to fish.
