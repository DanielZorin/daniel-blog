<h1>Estonia: Pärnu, Tallinn, Narva</h1>
<i>12-14 October 2016</i>
<h2>Pärnu</h2>
<p>
Many people come to Pärnu to go to the beach in summer. In autumn the city empties out and the streets are quiet.

<p>
The city is low-rise with wide streets and villas.

I arrived at a time when the city was beautifully covered with yellow leaves.

<h2>Tallinn</h2>
<p>
I was in Tallinn in 2006, and returned exactly 10 years later - in 2016. Of course, the old city changed little during this time, so even after all this time I remembered the city and more or less found my way around it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254871197_86f5119d96_o.jpg">
<p>
I don’t remember if those tall new buildings were already in the distance then.
<p/>

Most likely not yet, because they look pretty fresh.

<p>
The old town is beautiful, what else can I say about it? Almost everything is in excellent condition.

Stalin's Empire style in Tallinn. It starts somewhere not far from the fortress walls.

I haven’t really seen Tallinn outside the center, except for the bus station and the road to it. In Tallinn there are areas with Soviet blocks.

And there are more interesting residential buildings.

<h2>Narva</h2>
<p>
Narva is located exactly on the border with Russia, and the population there is predominantly Russian-speaking. I was in Narva in 2006, and, unlike Tallinn, 10 years later I did not recognize the city.
<p/>

Only the castle hasn't changed, of course.

In Narva Castle there is a monument to Lenin, moved here from the central square. As far as I know, this is the only monument to Lenin in the Baltics that still stands in the city (there is also a monument in Lithuania in a special park where old Soviet sculptures were moved).
<p/>

On the other side of the river is the Russian city of Ivangorod, which also has a fortress.

<p>
Border Bridge. Fortunately, you can walk along it - a rare phenomenon for Russian borders; most Russian border crossings are automobile-only, even where it would be reasonable to allow crossing on foot (in <a href="../baikal">Kyakhta</a>, for example ), because of this there are always huge queues.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256735793_ae27e2eeee_o.jpg">
<p>
There are many phenomena atypical for the Baltics in Narva. Here, for example, is the hammer and sickle on the obelisk.

Narva is very similar to Russian towns. Many buildings are in poor condition.

In 2006, as far as I remember, the main store in Narva was based on a Soviet supermarket. Now a bunch of modern shopping centers have been built here.
