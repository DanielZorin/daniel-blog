<h1>Bolivia: Copacabana, Coroico, La Paz</h1>
<i>6-15 April 2021</i>
<h2>Copacabana</h2>
<p>
A couple of hours drive from La Paz is the famous Lake Titicaca - the highest lake in the world (altitude about 3800 meters). Titicaca lies on the border of Bolivia and Peru, and the Peruvian part is more popular, but I could not get there due to the closure of the borders. The main Bolivian city on the lake is called Copacabana and is located on a fairly large peninsula with a narrow isthmus along which the border with Peru passes. From Bolivia, in order not to take a detour and also cross the border, you can get to the peninsula by ferry across the lake.

<p>
The road from La Paz to the ferry is almost flat and level, only at the very end there is a descent to the shore along a serpentine road.

The bus is transported to the other side on a slow ferry, but passengers must cross by motorboat.

Immediately after the crossing, the road goes up sharply and then constantly meanders through the mountains.

<p>
Copacabana has an atmosphere similar to backpacker towns in Southeast Asia. But because of the closure of borders, tourism in the city is a little comatose, especially on weekdays.
<p/>

<p>
Without tourists, most of the more expensive restaurants are closed, the main street is completely empty in the evening.

You can climb to the top of this mountain, but I didn’t dare, because the height is high and it’s still hard to breathe.

<h2>Isla del Sol</h2>
<p>
From Copacabana you can take a boat to the Island of the Sun. It turned out that the ship on which excursions are sold is essentially an ordinary ferry, and some passengers simply disembarked on the island, but tourists can walk a short track from one pier to another.

There is another large village at the northern end of the island, but due to some long-standing dispute, tourists are not allowed to the northern part of the island, and ships do not go there.

<h2>Coroico</h2>
<p>
Coroico is the case when it is not the city itself that is interesting, but the road to it. The drive from La Paz takes about two hours, and the elevation difference is colossal - from 3500 to 1500 meters. It was especially difficult to go down.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257079310_7d4b1a08f7_o.jpg">

<p>
The last 30 kilometers to Coroico used to be called the “Road of Death” because of the poor quality of the narrow road, on which incidents involving falling into the abyss often occurred. But it’s been about 15 years since they built a normal road along a different route, and the “Road of Death” is now used mainly by cyclists, with special transportation from La Paz to the last section.

<h2>La Paz</h2>
<p>
I consider stunning La Paz one of the most interesting and picturesque cities not only in South America, but throughout the world. This city deserves to be described in detail district by district, and let's start with the center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257395605_7101948701_o.jpg">
<p>
The entire center of La Paz is a big market where they sell everything. Supermarkets have not yet found high popularity in Bolivia, and here, like in the old days, everything is sold on the streets. Here is a man selling shoes.
<p/>

The main feature of La Paz, which makes this city so unique and unlike any other, is the cable cars. In recent years, 10 cable car lines have been built, they are united into a single network with transfer nodes, and cover all the main areas of La Paz and neighboring El Alto. One ticket costs 3 bolivianos, each transfer  2 bolivianos. Thanks to so many cable cars, in La Paz you can see a truly innumerable variety of panoramic views; the observation decks that I would have gone to 10 years ago, when there were no cable cars, have practically lost their meaning - every second of the trip around the city is like an observation deck. I visited all the stations on all the lines, but started with the Blue and Green lines leading to the southern part of La Paz.

The cities of El Alto and La Paz form a single entity. El Alto, as the name suggests, is located at altitude - namely on the Altiplano plateau, while La Paz is in a valley. The difference in altitude is very large - El Alto is at 4100 meters, and the center of La Paz is somewhere at 3600-3700. Since in Bolivia the lower the more prestigious, it turns out that El Alto is the poorest area, and this is true. Almost all the houses here are without paint. El Alto has a very long blue line, half of the purple line, and a short silver line that connects three other lines, and has no separate stations of its own.

The basis of the cable car network is made up of three parallel lines connecting La Paz and El Alto: red, purple and yellow. They offer the most dramatic views of the valley and surrounding mountains.
