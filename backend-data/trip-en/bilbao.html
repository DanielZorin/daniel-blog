<h1>Spain: Zaragoza, Pamplona, San Sebastian, Bilbao, Barcelona</h1>
<i>12-19 February 2014</i>
<h2>Zaragoza</h2>
<p>
The name "Zaragoza" came about as a result of a gradual modification of the Roman "Caesaraugusta". Still, the Spaniards are far from the French, who changed the Roman "augustus" into "aout", consisting of pretty much one sound [u]. Now Zaragoza is a fairly large city with a population of about 700,000, located on the periphery of tourist attention, but still has a certain flow due to the fact that it is located halfway between <a href="../girona">Barcelona</a> and <a href="../madrid1">Madrid</a>.

You can look at the city from above from one of the towers of the main cathedral (costs only 3 euros).

During the Napoleonic Wars, Zaragoza became a symbol of Spanish resistance to the French occupiers. The French fought for every house and suffered huge losses, killing most of the city's population. There is only one reminder left from those times: the gate where the fortress wall, which has not been preserved, once passed.

Sometimes the city is revived by political struggles for autonomy. There are many Basques living in Navarre, but they have less autonomy than the neighboring Basque Country. There is a movement to unite Navarre with the Basque Country.

<h2>San Sebastian</h2>

The Basques speak a completely unique language and want independence from the Spanish occupation. At the same time, you can’t hear the Basque language on the streets at all; everyone speaks only Spanish. This is probably because there are still a lot of Spaniards, especially in the cities, and it won’t work for everyone to speak their own language, as in Catalonia, because Basque is completely different.

What is called "tapas" in Spain is called "pintxos" here. I still don't understand this part of Spanish culture. What's the point of coming here to have a small sandwich, like at a buffet table? On weekends there are constant parties with drinking. This is what the streets look like in the morning.

<h2>Bilbao</h2>
<p>
Bilbao is the largest city in the Basque Country (but not the capital, the capital is Vitoria). There are no popular beaches in the immediate vicinity, so tourists come here mainly to see the Guggenheim Museum and other examples of modern architecture.

The second attraction of Bilbao after the Guggenheim Museum is the Biscay Bridge - the world's first "flying ferry", built at the end of the 19th century. The bridge is located outside of Bilbao and connects two neighboring cities - Portugalete and Getxo. It’s easy to get there by metro; it has two lines that run together in the center and then diverge along the two banks of the river. The Bilbao metro was designed by Norman Foster.

A popular pastime is getting useful things out of trash cans. The pros have special poles for these purposes.

<h2>Barcelona</h2>
<p>
What to do when you come to Barcelona for the fifth time? Of course, look at the city from above! Last time I visited <a href="../barcelona">the roof of La Pedrera and the Sagrada Familia tower</a>, as well as <a href="../valencia">Tibidabo</a>. But the best view is perhaps from the Columbus Monument.

In the other direction - Montjuic mountain and the port.

View of the old city. The towers in the middle are the cathedral, directly behind it the towers of the Sagrada Familia are partially visible.

I lived in a hostel on Gran Via. From the inside it looks like old houses in St. Petersburg or Moscow - many, many rooms, very high ceilings, wide corridors. The elevator is behind bars. A room in Barcelona costs 17 euros.

Nearby is another observation deck with a beautiful view of Plaza de España.

This is an observation deck on the roof of the bullring. When I first visited Barcelona in 2011, the arena was still an arena, now it is a shopping center. There is a lift outside that costs 1 euro, but you can go inside the shopping center, take the elevator or escalators to the top floor, and from there go out to the roof for free.

Subway fares have increased since last time. Previously, 10 trips cost a little less than 10 euros, now - a little more. The people are protesting.

And in El Corte Ingles you can now buy Russian products.
