<h1>Spain: Zaragoza, Pamplona, San Sebastian, Bilbao, Barcelona</h1>
<i>12-19 February 2014</i>
<h2>Zaragoza</h2>
<p>
The name "Zaragoza" came about as a result of a gradual modification of the Roman "Caesaraugusta". Still, the Spaniards are far from the French, who changed the Roman "augustus" into "aout", consisting of pretty much one sound [u]. Now Zaragoza is a fairly large city with a population of about 700,000, located on the periphery of tourist attention, but still has a certain flow due to the fact that it is located halfway between <a href="../girona">Barcelona</a> and <a href="../madrid1">Madrid</a>.

You can look at the city from above from one of the towers of the main cathedral (costs only 3 euros).

The old bridge leads straight to the residential areas on the other side of the river.

This is the view from here, the tower with the elevator is the one closest to the right.

By the way, for some reason they really don’t like photography inside this church.

During the Napoleonic Wars, Zaragoza became a symbol of Spanish resistance to the French occupiers. The French fought for every house and suffered huge losses, killing most of the city's population. There is only one reminder left from those times: the gate where the fortress wall, which has not been preserved, once passed.

<h2>Pamplona</h2>
<p>
Once a year in the city of Pamplona, bulls are released from this pen.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256615046_019f0014e8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is nothing inside the pen during the off-season.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257658085_f95aeea9c7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Bulls run past the town hall.

<p>
And to the bullring.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256816098_bc769eba67_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A huge number of tourists come to Pamplona to watch the running bulls, and maybe even go for a run themselves. This action is called Encierro.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257361754_6ad3593aad_h.jpg"/>

The rest of the time it is a quiet small town.

In the center of the city there is a well-preserved star-shaped fortress, which has now been converted into a city park and picnic area.

Sometimes the city is revived by political struggles for autonomy. There are many Basques living in Navarre, but they have less autonomy than the neighboring Basque Country. There is a movement to unite Navarre with the Basque Country.
<p/>

In Basque, Pamplona is called Iruña. Both names are often written on public transport schedules.

<h2>San Sebastian</h2>
<p>
Do you dream of walking in white pants on the beach with a view of the statue of Jesus, but don’t have the money for a ticket to Rio? No problem, there is a good replacement quite close, in Spain.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256500755_6db32177d7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It has its own Mount Corcovado, with a statue of Jesus at the top.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256500145_38c2ab4f9b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And its own Sugar Loaf opposite, with a cable car. I chose Corcovado (Monte Urgull actually) to climb.

There is only an empty lighthouse, but in the summer there is a beach and ferries.

In winter, the water level appears to be higher and the beach is flooded.

By the way, berets are more popular in the Basque Country than in France; they are worn everywhere and sold in stores.

What San Sebastian and Rio de Janeiro also have in common is the majestic 19th-century imperial architecture that resulted from the city's early development as a resort.

<p>
The Basques speak a completely unique language and want independence from the Spanish occupation. At the same time, you can’t hear the Basque language on the streets at all; everyone speaks only Spanish. This is probably because there are still a lot of Spaniards, especially in the cities, and it won’t work for everyone to speak their own language, as in Catalonia, because Basque is completely different.
<p/>

<p>
What is called "tapas" in Spain is called "pintxos" here. I still don't understand this part of Spanish culture. What's the point of coming here to have a small sandwich, like at a buffet table? On weekends there are constant parties with drinking. This is what the streets look like in the morning.
<p/>

<h2>Bilbao</h2>
<p>
Bilbao is the largest city in the Basque Country (but not the capital, the capital is Vitoria). There are no popular beaches in the immediate vicinity, so tourists come here mainly to see the Guggenheim Museum and other examples of modern architecture.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255197397_88fd312815_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Since I am not much of a connoisseur of contemporary art, I did not go to the Guggenheim Museum.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256674914_dc8d3cd4fa_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I limited myself to exploring the surrounding area, which is printed on souvenirs from Bilbao.

By the way, about souvenirs. Here in souvenir shops they sell glasses with the inscription “Catalonia and the Basque Country - together on the road to independence.”
<p/>

There are even skyscrapers.

This view, by the way, is from a park on a hill where there used to be a factory, and then it was converted, so now only a chimney reminds of it.

<p>
The second attraction of Bilbao after the Guggenheim Museum is the Biscay Bridge - the world's first "flying ferry", built at the end of the 19th century. The bridge is located outside of Bilbao and connects two neighboring cities - Portugalete and Getxo. It’s easy to get there by metro; it has two lines that run together in the center and then diverge along the two banks of the river. The Bilbao metro was designed by Norman Foster.

Interestingly, there is a similar monument on the other side of the river.

It costs just 35 cents for pedestrians to get to the other side. Motorists - 1.35, cyclists - 60 cents.

But there is a beach here.

A popular pastime is getting useful things out of trash cans. The pros have special poles for these purposes.

<h2>Barcelona</h2>
<p>
What to do when you come to Barcelona for the fifth time? Of course, look at the city from above! Last time I visited <a href="../barcelona">the roof of La Pedrera and the Sagrada Familia tower</a>, as well as <a href="../valencia">Tibidabo</a>. But the best view is perhaps from the Columbus Monument.

Highway running along the sea. You can see the Agbar skyscraper and the shrimp monument in the distance.

In the other direction - Montjuic mountain and the port.

View of the old city. The towers in the middle are the cathedral, directly behind it the towers of the Sagrada Familia are partially visible.

I lived in a hostel on Gran Via. From the inside it looks like old houses in St. Petersburg or Moscow - many, many rooms, very high ceilings, wide corridors. The elevator is behind bars. A room in Barcelona costs 17 euros.

Nearby is another observation deck with a beautiful view of Plaza de España.

Right down this street is the train station.

This is an observation deck on the roof of the bullring. When I first visited Barcelona in 2011, the arena was still an arena, now it is a shopping center. There is a lift outside that costs 1 euro, but you can go inside the shopping center, take the elevator or escalators to the top floor, and from there go out to the roof for free.

Subway fares have increased since last time. Previously, 10 trips cost a little less than 10 euros, now - a little more. The people are protesting.

There are still many Arabic and Indian shops in Raval.

And in El Corte Ingles you can now buy Russian products.
