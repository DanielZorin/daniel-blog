<h2>Riga</h2>
<p>
On the way from Germany to St. Petersburg, I passed through Riga for half a day. I didn’t really have time to look at anything, I just bought some sanctioned goods.

For the first time I was in Riga in winter. Ice, snow.

The old city is carefully cleared of snow.

Falun Gong supporters are now in Riga. Why are their posters in the same font in all countries?

And on the other side of the river, meanwhile, there are all sorts of interesting places. I should explore Riga in more detail sometime.
