<h1>United Kingdom: Manchester, Liverpool</h1>
<i>1-3 September 2019</i>
<h2>Manchester</h2>
<p>
From Northern Ireland I flew back to England to the city of Manchester. A full-day tram ticket costs only slightly more than a train ticket to the station. The tram network is extensive - 8 lines.

It turned out that Manchester is a wonderful city with a large historical center and classic Victorian palace-like buildings.

<h2>Liverpool</h2>
<p>
Liverpool is just an hour's drive from Manchester. In the 19th century it was the second most important city in England after London, and the main port. The world's first regular passenger railway ran from Liverpool to Manchester and opened in 1830. Later, when the importance of seaports greatly decreased, the city fell into decay. But then The Beatles appeared, thanks to them everyone still knows about this city. What remains from Liverpool's 19th century prosperity is pretentious Victorian architecture, which was for some time in poor condition (as in <a href="http://goo.gl/5rrYrf">Yangon</a> or <a href="https://goo.gl/uz6yvz">Mumbai</a>), but now mostly restored.
<p/>

Instead of a main square, there is a main pier - what people saw when arriving in Liverpool by sea.

Everything would be fine, but one of the two elevators never worked, so I went to the 14th floor and walked up another floor. And next day the second elevator broke down for a while, so I had to go up all 15 floors of stairs. But from the staircase there is a gorgeous view of the whole city.

In the USA they officially sell special subscriptions for 50-70 dollars that allow you to go through security control with a shorter queue (but first the American security will check your reliability). In England they make it simpler - you pay 5 pounds right on the spot and go to the short queue.

Let's look a little at a supermarket in the UK. The most common brand in this country is Tesco, just like in good old Thailand. England happens to be the birthplace of this network, and there are more than 3,000 of them (in Thailand - a little less than 2,000; there are also in Malaysia, Ireland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland, with a total of less than 1,000). In England, there are especially many Tesco stores in the format of a small supermarket rather than a hypermarket. I visited one of these in the center of Liverpool. A distinctive feature of these stores is that they often write simply gigantic numbers on the price tags. Also, if the product costs less than a pound, then instead of 0.49 they write 49p (49 pence). 1 GBP is slightly more expensive than 1 EUR. Bananas are sold individually for 25p.

Coffee from Starbucks costs 1.90, regular coffee here costs 1.60, but in general it is often sold cheaper, even in small stores. Iced coffee is popular here.

Beer. There is Guinness here for £5.25 for 4 cans, which by the way is cheaper than in Ireland. Though in this store you can't buy one can, only a pack.
