<h1>Italy: Fortezza, Bolzano, Trento, Bologna, Rimini</h1>
<i>27-29 June 2023</i>
<h2>Fortezza</h2>
<p>
The region of Trentino-Alto Adige, also known as South Tyrol, was transferred from Austria to Italy following the First World War. In the northern half, German is still spoken mainly. For a long time, the government tried to Italianize the local population, and only in the 1970s was it given broad autonomy, expanded in the 1990s. Only in 1992 did Austria officially declare that it no longer had any claims against Italy regarding the infringement of the German-speaking population. All cities here have two names - Italian and German.

<p>
The local mountains are called Dolomite Alps, or simply Dolomites.
<p/>

<p>
The Dolomites are when there are such sharp, numerous peaks.

<h2>Bolzano</h2>
<p>
Bolzano (Bozen in German) is the capital of the German-speaking province of the same name. In the city itself, however, the majority speak Italian (apparently many migrants, both domestic and foreign). The city is in a very picturesque area among meadows and vineyards.
<p/>

<p>
Visually, it is clearly noticeable that this is not a typical Italian city. For example, there are no shutters here.

Train tickets in Italy now look like this instead of the yellow background design used in most countries. They still need to be composted, but not always - some are labeled as valid on a specific train. It is not clear what this depends on - the interface of the machine is always the same, and the class of trains is the same regional.

<h2>Trento</h2>

Trento is the capital of South Tyrol. This city is in the southern half of the province, where the majority speaks Italian. And unlike Bolzano, it’s immediately clear that you’re in Italy.

Bologna is the capital of the Emilia-Romagna region and the city where the world's oldest university is located.

Bologna was recently added to the World Heritage List, but not in itself, but... the porticoes.

Porticoes are covered sidewalk galleries. Indeed, there are very, very many of them in Bologna.

Another unusual feature of Bologna are the medieval towers. In the 12th and 13th centuries there were many more of them, now only a few remain. The most famous pair of towers is in the center, you can climb the highest one, but I couldn’t find the strength (there is no elevator, the height is high, and this was not the first city that day).

The Emilia-Romagna region is basically a plain like this. In the south, the Apennines separate it from Tuscany.

<h2>Rimini</h2>
<p>
Rimini is a small city on the Adriatic coast of Italy. Previously, it was quite popular among tourists from Russia; there were even charter flights to the local airport. There are much fewer tourists now. Since Rimini is a modest and unpretentious resort, those who want chic will go to the Amalfi Coast or towards the Cote d'Azur. And those who want to save money will go to Turkey. So now it’s mostly Italians who hang out here (there are almost no tours from Italy to Turkey). Apparently, that’s why you could rent a hotel room in the summer for just 20 euros! Nowhere else in Italy have I seen anything close to such prices, even in the winter 10 years ago.

What impressed me most were the endless rows of sunbeds on the beach; I had never seen so many sunbeds in my life.

<p>
It also plays a role that the beach is very wide - in Crimea, etc. in fact, in places it’s more crowded, but there the beach is narrow, and there are no such endless rows stretching into the distance.

In Rimini there is transport called "Metromare", which is in fact a trolleybus.

The historical center is located on the other side of the station than the sea. That is, the city was near the sea, but was not a port. There is a Roman arch.
