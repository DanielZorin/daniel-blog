<h1>Russia: Moscow, Beslan, Vladikavkaz</h1>
<i>9-12 June 2022</i>
<h2>Moscow</h2>
<p>
<i>
I've seen secret maps, I know where we're going.<br/>
Captain, I came to say goodbye to you, to you and your ship.<br/>
I went down into the hold, I talked there with Mr. Chief of the Rats.<br/>
The rats go ashore at the nearest port in the hope of escape.<br/>
On the upper deck an orchestra plays and couples dance the foxtrot,<br/>
The steward pours the fire into the glasses and watches the ice melt.<br/>
He looks at the dancers, who have forgotten that each of them will die.<br/>
But no one wants to think about it while the Titanic is sailing!<br/>
(Nautilus Pompilius, 1994)<br/>

In June 2022, I boarded a plane and flew Through the Looking Glass - a magical land where the Firebird lives in a palace and everyone always wins, no matter what happens. Just in case, I cleaned the phone, and I didn’t use VPN, so for all three days I was, like the inhabitants of Through the Looking Glass, in a wonderful suspended animation of isolation from the real world.

It's a strange feeling. There was an almost full bottle of Martini left at home from New Year's. There were fish and scallops in the freezer. It’s as if I’m looking at abandoned Pripyat, only in its role is the place where I myself once lived.

Russia, it turns out, is the birthplace of Pushkin, but I thought it was associated with another character with a similar surname.

In the grocery store, the assortment decreased somewhat and everything became more expensive (at that time Coca-Cola had not yet run out), and converted to dollars the price increased very much. At that time, it was theoretically possible to live in Russia and work remotely, but it was very unprofitable.

In March I left with the pain of the fact that I might never see my home again. Well, at least I saw it once, I can leave with a light heart.

<h2>Beslan</h2>
<p>
Vladikavkaz airport is located in the neighboring small town of Beslan, which would still be a small town near the airport if not for the famous terrorist attack with the seizure of a school in 2004.
