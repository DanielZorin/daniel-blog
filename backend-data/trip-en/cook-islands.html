<h1>Cook Islands</h1>
<i>31 January - 1 February 2020</i>
<p>
The Cook Islands are a state in free association with New Zealand, and of all the not-fully-independent countries, one of the closest to independence. It has its own legislative and executive powers, and New Zealand is responsible only for defense and partially for foreign policy. The currency used is New Zealand dollars with locally minted coins, residents have New Zealand passports, but cannot vote by default. Entry to the Cook Islands is visa-free for everyone.

The main island of the country is called Rarotonga, and has a population of only 13 thousand (for comparison <a href="../tonga">Tongatapu</a> has 70 thousand, <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/tag/samoa">Upolu</a> has 145 thousand). The second largest island is Aitutaki with a population of 2000 and most of the huge luxury hotels. There are a couple of dozen other islands with a population of no more than a few hundred, and flights once a month. Large planes from New Zealand and Australia fly to Rarotonga quite often.

Rarotonga is very close in shape to a circle with a radius of about 5 kilometers; accordingly, the road around the island has a length of 2π*5 = 30 kilometers. If you push yourself, you can even walk in a day, but it’s easier by bus. There are two routes: clockwise and counterclockwise. They run every hour, one at :00 minutes, the other at :30 (although, according to my observations, the counterclockwise route sometimes misses its turn). The fare is $5 (NZD), a day pass costs $16.

The capital of Cook Islands is called Avarua. Essentially this is the place where government agencies are concentrated, and locals' house stand along the main road just as throughout the rest of the island.

As on other islands of Oceania, there are many cemeteries along the road.

In Rarotonga, headstones are usually modest, and for some reason the slabs are often covered with bath tiles.

Car number. Kia Orana means "Hello". Similar to the New Zealand greeting Kia Ora, and for good reason - it is believed that the Maori who settled New Zealand came from the Cook Islands.

I lived around 10 kilometers from the capital clockwise, thanks to airbnb. Hotels in Rarotonga are outrageously expensive.

Opposite the house there was a field where one could meet a goat.

Mostly hotels and tourists are located on the southern and western coasts of the island. Restaurants look something like this:

Food is quite expensive.

<p>
Interestingly, regular cola costs one and a half times more than diet cola, though diet cola is already expensive.

I wanted to go from the south coast to the north through the uninhabited center of the island, but I was out of luck - just at that time the track was closed for a month.

All the beaches that I saw when I drove around the island were like this, with a bunch of stones and branches.

It was also a bit unpleasant to meet a large number of aggressive dogs (this is generally a problem throughout Oceania).

The map showed some paths going deeper, so I decided to explore what was there.

Grandma sells bananas and dragonfruit from her garden. Somehow it turned out that dragonfruit is grown en masse on this island.
