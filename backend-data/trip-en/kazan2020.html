<h1>Russia: Kazan, Chistopol, Bolgar</h1>
<i>22-25 June 2020</i>
<h2>Kazan</h2>
<p>
After the "self-isolation regime" (lockdown) in the spring of 2020, the first trip I made outside of Moscow was to Tatarstan: I have long wanted to visit Kazan again, where I was <a href="../kazan">in 2012</a>, and a couple more interesting places in this republic. I flew to Kazan by plane, which was approximately the same price as a sleeper train (4 thousand rubles).

The airport is good and convenient, but the transportation to it is a complete disgrace. Besides taxi there are two options. Ride on a minibus, which also makes a huge detour to enter the village north of the airport, to the distant metro station. Or take the train to the central station, but the train only runs two or three times a day. It’s good that the train time was right for me for the return flight.

<p>
I settled in the center, a stone's throw from Bauman Street.

<p>
Many restaurants were closed, the rest only had summer verandas open.

It was quite quiet in the evening.

National Bank. The gold reserves of the Russian Empire were kept here during the First World War; after the capture of Kazan by white troops, it fell into the hands of Admiral Kolchak and went to Siberia.

It turned out that the Kazan Kremlin is open to visitors until late; you can take a walk there in the evening.

<p>
But still, over 7 years, there are fewer dilapidated yards in the center, and they are now much less noticeable.

In Kazan, as usual, I traveled around non-tourist areas, focusing on metro stations and monuments to Lenin. There are a lot of monuments to Lenin in Kazan, I easily walked around 10 on the streets, and that’s not the limit, I didn’t even have to go to any hard-to-reach places (and there are a few more). I caught the first Lenin near the Gorki metro station on the way from the airport.

It’s worth traveling to the outskirts and monuments to Lenin for such rich shots.

<h2>Bolgar</h2>
<p>
Bolgar is the ancient capital of Volga Bulgaria and a World Heritage Site. It was added to the list in 2014, after my first trip to Kazan. The main problen is that it is not very easy to get here - it takes more than three hours by bus from Kazan, because you need to make a long detour to go around the confluence of the Kama and Volga. Buses rarely run. Therefore, it is very advisable to be here in the summer, during the period of river navigation, when passenger hovercraft run from Kazan to Bolgar every day. It takes about two hours to travel, and the schedule is especially convenient for tourists: in the morning to Bolgar, in the evening back. A round-trip ticket costs just over 700 rubles.

<p>
Bolgar is located near the confluence of the Kama and Volga. This is a very wide confluence, the mouth of the Kama is 15-20 kilometers in size. The port is located one and a half kilometers from the city of Bolgar, and 5-6 kilometers from the archaeological zone. After the ship arrives, you can take a bus to the museum for 30 rubles, then back at the end. Buses also run from the museum to the White Mosque, the distance between them is 3 kilometers. In general, it is very convenient and cheap for tourists.

The ferry terminal is empty, there is nothing there, tickets are sold at the entrance to the ship. There is a new ferry terminal right next to the museum, but for some reason it is not used for its intended purpose.

Bulgars are a Turkic people. Initially they lived in the steppes of the Black Sea region (eastern Ukraine and southern Russia), then some of them moved to the Danube, created the Bulgarian kingdom there, gradually mixed with the Slavs, and began to speak the Slavic language (albeit without cases) - these are the inhabitants of the modern country of Bulgaria. Other Bulgars moved east to the Volga region, where Volga Bulgaria existed in the 10th to 13th centuries. Back in the 10th century, they converted to Islam, in honor of which this monument now stands.

<p>
Volga Bulgaria was conquered by the Mongols in the 13th century along with Russia. Subsequently, it was part of the Golden Horde, after its collapse - the center of the Kazan Khanate (with the capital already in Kazan). At the beginning of the 15th century, the city of Bolgar was destroyed by Russian princes. Later, an Orthodox monastery was founded in its place, and ten kilometers from it - the new city of Spassk. In 1935, Spassk was renamed Kuibyshev, and in 1957 it was flooded during the construction of the Kama Reservoir. New Kuibyshev was founded on the site of the small village of Bolgar near the ruins of the ancient city, and in 1991 it was renamed back to Bolgar. Locals call it both Bolgar and Bulgar, with the emphasis in both cases on the first syllable.
