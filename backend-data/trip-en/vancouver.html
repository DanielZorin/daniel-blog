<h1>Canada: Vancouver</h1>
<i>6-7 June 2018</i>
<h2>Vancouver</h2>
<p>
Vancouver is the largest, and in fact the only city on the Pacific coast of Canada in the province of British Columbia. This is supposedly the most expensive city in Canada, and it has the most Chinese people, which is why it is also called Hongcouver. The city is growing rapidly, the entire center has long been covered in skyscrapers, but there is no easily recognizable landmark in this city, like the Space Needle in Seattle or the CN Tower in Toronto.

<p>
When you look at the panorama of Vancouver, you really notice some Chinese motifs.

It could be a Chinese metropolis like <a href="../guangdong">Shenzhen</a>.

Bank of China with a recognizable logo is already here.

This city hall could easily pass for Chinese if it weren’t for the flag.
<p/>

<p>
But the center itself is still rather North American.

<p>
Not least of all, this is hinted at by yellow traffic lights and green street signs (in China, signs are usually blue).

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254952932_78d2988683_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On the embankment there is a whole series of berths for seaplanes. Here it is a popular entertainment, and at the same time convenient - you can live somewhere in the mountains and fly to work in the very center.

This is exactly the oldest part of the city; something from the first half of the 20th century has been preserved here.

The main railway station, which was built as the end point of the transcontinental railway connecting eastern Canada with the Pacific coast in 1914.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256729545_b0c4af1c36_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Thanks to this station, Vancouver essentially began to grow as a city.

Inside. For more than 40 years, trains have been running to another station, and this one is used as a metro transfer station.

The second station, from where you can still travel to Toronto. Intercity buses also come here.

A few blocks south of here is East Hastings Street.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255887448_09f02be152_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The place is famous for the high concentration of drug addicts on the streets.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256729200_55c3b443c0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Homeless people and drug addicts are densely packed along the road, apparently this is the only place in the center from where they are not driven away, that’s why they are all here, and not on half the streets, as in <a href="../san-francisco"> San Francisco</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255887348_7347739967_h.jpg"/>

It’s a little dark here even during the day, so I was filming on the sly.

British Columbia is a beautiful region with many mountains and lakes. The most popular destination in the Vancouver area is Whistler Ski Resort, which hosted outdoor competitions during the 2010 Olympics. The prices there are such that Switzerland will seem cheap in comparison. However, beautiful places begin almost within the city limits, you don’t need to travel far, a regular bus will suffice.

<p>
On the other side of the bay, formally it is no longer Vancouver, but North Vancouver, however, public transport tickets work the same way. There are two similar places in North Vancouver with suspension bridges over the canyon, but one costs about $30 to enter and the other is free.

Canadian forest. I most often walk through all sorts of tropical jungles, so it was unusual to find myself in such a forest.

Although these twisting tree roots, forming something like terraces, always seemed to me an attribute of the tropics. In Russia, for example, I don’t remember this.

Right next to the center there is a huge Stanley Park, which takes up almost half of the peninsula on which Vancouver stands.

It is convenient to travel around Vancouver by metro (SkyTrain), which has three large lines.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256727380_769fceb352_h.jpg"/>
<p>
An all-day ticket costs $10 CAD and is also valid on buses. Vancouver has three fare zones (for example, North Vancouver is the second zone), but a day pass is valid for all.

It can be seen that apartment buildings with 15  floors are popular in Vancouver. A rare view in other cities in Canada and the USA.

This is New Westminster station in the city of the same name.

<p>
The city is notable for being the first in the region and the capital of British Columbia. In 1866, the territories on the mainland and the large Vancouver Island (not to be confused with the city of Vancouver) off the coast were united into a single colony, the capital of which was (and still remains) the city of Victoria on Vancouver Island. New Westminster lost its capital status, and later, when the Trans-Canada Railway was completed, it ceased to be the largest city, giving way to the expanding city of Vancouver, where the station was located.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256728555_53bc51cc32_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Since the city is old, there are few traces of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

<p>
I didn’t go back along the same section that I had traveled before, but took a train going away from the center, since this line intersects with another after several stops. Thus, I made a big circle around Vancouver, riding most of the length of two subway lines.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255886973_4980246384_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There was finally a low-rise neighborhood outside of New Westminster.

And then again residential areas.
