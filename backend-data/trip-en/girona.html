<h1>Spain: Portbou, Girona, Barcelona</h1>
<i>17-18 November 2013</i>
<h2>Portbou</h2>
<p>
A small town on the border with France.

<p>
Trains from both French and Spanish railway companies operate from here.

<p>
The station is on the hill, the embankment is below.

<p>
France is over the hill on the left.

General view of the city. Rainy, cold weather is clearly not the best time to visit.

<h2>Girona</h2>
<p>
During my fourth time in Barcelona, I finally visited the neighboring city of Girona. Each time the level of Catalan nationalism is rising, now the Catalan government is already demanding a referendum similar to Scotland, but Madrid does not agree. In Girona, the red and yellow striped flags dazzle the eyes.

<p>
Now they are selling souvenirs with the inscription "Catalonia - a new country in Europe."
<p/>

<p>
Let's count the Catalan flags together.

<p>
I practically didn’t read guidebooks and therefore had a vague idea of what to expect from Girona, and what attractions there were, besides the standard main cathedral, etc. It turned out that in Girona there is a promenade with colorful houses, like on <a href="../buenos-aires">Caminito</a>.
<p/>

<p>
This is perhaps the most interesting place in Girona.

<p>
The river behind the old town immediately becomes shallow.
<p/>

<p>
On the other side, it has been dry for a long time.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256123746_643fc0b0a8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also, of course, a cathedral and several other churches.
<p/>

<p>
The children came on a hike.

<p>
The largest Catalan flag.

<p>
Someone wanted to say something in English, but I didn’t understand anything.

<p>
Outdoor defibrillator. They are not often enough to save a person from a heart attack anywhere, but they are still better than nothing.

<p>
In Girona, near the station, there is a very beautiful house with colored bas-reliefs.

<h2>Barcelona</h2>
<p>
It’s a very special feeling to return to a city where you’ve already been before. The most interesting thing, of course, is to return after ten years, as was my experience with Paris and <a href="../vyborg">St Petersburg</a>, but after a few months is also not bad. You can walk around the city without a map. There is no longer any need to see the main attractions, since all of them have been seen more than once. You can take care of pressing issues, for example, buy wine and olive oil. You turn the corner, and there’s La Pedrera in the next block, but you’re going in the other direction.

<p>
You run past the quarter of discord.
<p/>

<p>
But only this time did I pay attention to the lampposts on Gracia Street, although, after reviewing old photographs, I made sure that they were there in March 2011.

<p>
My initial plan was to check into a hostel (only 7 euros per bed, that’s what competition means!) and walk around the Raval quarter at night, gawk at the prostitutes and hucksters. But I was disappointed - it was raining, and even on the Rambla there was no one.
<p/>

<p>
In the morning the weather was somewhat better.
<p/>

<p>
But even this was enough to see an incredible sight - the almost empty Portal del Angel street.
<p/>

<p>
I walked to the drinking fountain that I use every time I'm in Barcelona.
<p/>

<p>
Moved towards Raval.
<p/>

<p>
The Spaniards are protesting against tightening their belts.

<p>
In Raval in the morning everything is quite peaceful.
<p/>

<p>
Mostly tourists walk around.
<p/>

<p>
Only the occasional Arabic shops remind you of the essence of this area.

On the way to the airport, I got confused in the Barcelona metro at one of the central stations, where there are about five lines, moreover, belonging to different operators, and as a result I made a small detour.
