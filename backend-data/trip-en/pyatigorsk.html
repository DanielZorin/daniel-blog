<p>
If you want to fly to the Caucasus cheaply, then your path lies here, to the airport in Mineralnye Vody.

<p>
Welcome to Caucasian Mineral Waters! Taxis are offered persistently, but minibuses run frequently.

At the station there is an eagle, the symbol of neighboring Pyatigorsk.

Mineralnye Vody is not the main resort, and looks very shabby.

Let's go through the main attractions. This is a tacky restaurant.

<h2>Pyatigorsk</h2>
<p>
After admiring the boss, reading the freshly pasted poster about the Columbus Theater's tour in Pyatigorsk and drinking two five-kopeck glasses of Narzan, the travelers entered the city on the tram line "Vokzal - Tsvetnik". They were charged ten kopecks for entry into the Flower Garden. In the "Flower Garden" there was a lot of music, a lot of cheerful people and very few flowers. In a white shell, a symphony orchestra performed the “Dance of the Mosquitoes.” <i>Ilf and Petrov, "The 12 chairs"</i>
<p/>

<p>
Narzan was sold at the Lermontov Gallery.
<p/>

<p>
Narzan was sold in kiosks and by hawkers. Nobody cared about two dirty diamond hunters.
 “Eh, Kisa,” said Ostap, “we are strangers at this celebration of life.”
<p/>

<p>
(Note that now in all sources you can pour Narzan for free, only containers are sold).

<p>
The great strategist moved at a shooting pace along the mountain road leading around Mashuk to the place of Lermontov’s duel with Martynov. Past sanatoriums and rest houses, overtaken by buses and two-horse carriages, Ostap came to Proval. A small gallery carved into the rock led into a cone-shaped (cone up) hole.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256875598_8ee560d5af_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The gallery ended with a balcony, standing on which one could see at the bottom of the hole a small puddle of malachite-smelling liquid. This Proval is considered a landmark of Pyatigorsk, and therefore a considerable number of excursions and single tourists visit it per day.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256875583_10f6682439_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Ostap immediately found out that Proval for a person devoid of prejudices can be a profitable source of income.

“It’s an amazing thing,” Ostap reflected, “how the city has not yet figured out to charge ten kopecks for the entrance to Proval. This, it seems, is the only place where Pyatigorsk residents allow tourists in without money. I will destroy this shameful stain on the city’s reputation, I will correct this annoying omission.” .

And Ostap acted as his reason, healthy instinct and the current situation told him.

He stopped at the entrance to Proval and, shaking the receipt book in his hands, cried out from time to time:

- Buy tickets, citizens. Ten kopecks! Children and Red Army soldiers are free! Students - five kopecks! Non-union members - thirty kopecks.

Ostap was sure to hit. Pyatigorsk residents did not go to Proval, and it was not the slightest difficulty to rip off ten kopecks from a Soviet tourist for entry “somewhere.”

<p>
While the great schemer was deftly selling the view of the malachite puddle, Ippolit Matveyevich, hunched over and wallowing in shame, stood under the acacia tree and, without looking at the walkers, chewed the three phrases handed to him:
- Monsieur, je ne mange... Geben sie mir bitte... Give something to the State Duma deputy...
<p/>

<p>
To make the autopsy safer, the friends climbed almost to the very top of Mashuk.

Below, Pyatigorsk glowed with solid, motionless lights.

Below Pyatigorsk, poor lights marked the village of Goryachevodskaya.

<p>
On the horizon, Kislovodsk protruded from behind the mountain in two parallel dotted lines.

Ostap looked into the starry sky and took out the well-known pliers from his pocket.

Pyatigorsk is a resort, so a lot of people rent out housing here. There is no greeting at the station in May, but you can call through the announcements on the poles. We settled in the private sector at the foot of Mashuk for 1000 rubles. On the way back there was a great apartment for only 800.

The tram line looks very beautiful - the old paving stones have been preserved under it.

Pyatigorsk, hold on to the pepper.

Someone made a joke.

<p>
Someone else is joking (Entry banned to president Obama). It’s not for nothing that Pyatigorsk residents succeed in KVN.

Narzan flows straight from the mountain, you can even swim.

Lenin in Pyatigorsk is incredibly epic: he stands on a mountain above a huge staircase, looking at the city.
<p/>

<p>
There is also an interesting place, which is marked on the map as “Rock Portrait of Lenin”. To be honest, I was expecting something a little different in style.
<p/>

<p>
The history is written on the plaque in a very interesting font.

This memorial wall is decorated in an equally interesting font.

I recommend Pyatigorsk, come here to refresh yourself with Narzan.
