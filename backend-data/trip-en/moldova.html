<h1>Moldova: Chisinau</h1>
<i>31 January - 1 February 2013</i>
<h2>Chisinau</h2>
<p>
Which is more correct: Moldova or Moldavia? In Russian language it is a disputed question, similar to the naming of Belarus/Belorussia. In English it's simpler: the modern country is called Moldova (like in the local language), and Moldavia is the historical region, part of which is in modern Romania.

In Chisinau, however, many people communicate in Russian, not Romanian, in everyday life. Russian speech can often be heard on the streets; there are many signs in Russian.

With all this, the local government has Latvian quirks about the Soviet occupation, those shot personally by Stalin, etc. They are even going to erect a memorial opposite the presidential palace, as the sign says.

Written Romanian is not difficult to understand if you know other Roman languages ​​and read about the grammar. I understood almost all the inscriptions, despite the fact that in Romanian I only know “Nu ma nu ma iei” and some songs Zdob si Zdub. Romania is loved here.

At the stops there is a bus schedule accurate to the minute. Payment on buses and trams is like in the provinces in Russia, the conductor unwinds small tickets from a roll. The fare is incredibly cheap, about 8 rubles.
