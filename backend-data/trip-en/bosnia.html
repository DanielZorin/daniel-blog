<h1>Bosnia and Herzegovina: Travnik, Jajce, Sarajevo, Mostar, Neum</h1>
<i>26-30 June 2014</i>
<h2>Travnik</h2>
<p>
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a small Yugoslavia. In Yugoslavia there were Orthodox (Serbs, Macedonians), Catholics (Croats, Slovenes) and Muslims (Bosnians, Kosovo Albanians), and in Bosnia there are also Orthodox, Catholics, and Muslims. Tito naively thought that this would prevent separatism, but in reality it led to an all-out war of all against all. The country is just recovering from the disaster of 1992-1995, and different peoples still live here separately. Almost all of Bosnia consists of low mountains, the roads are continuous serpentines.

The first city I visited in Bosnia was Travnik. Bosnian Muslims live in Travnik.

One of the main features of Bosnia is that a cemetery can be placed in the middle of the city in any corner.

What I cannot understand is how is it that Islam became widespread only in Bosnia? It’s clear with the Croats, they lived under the rule of Catholic Austria. But why did those Serbs who lived on the territory of Bosnia convert to Islam, but those who lived in the territory of modern Serbia didn't? After all, both were part of the Ottoman Empire for several centuries.

Bosnia is much poorer than Croatia; much has not been rebuilt since the days of socialism. For example, the bus station is similar to the stations in Russian regional centers. People are allowed onto the platform with tickets, like in <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/tag/serbia">Serbia</a>, and not in <a href="http://juan.livejournal. com/tag/croatia">Croatia</a>.

After not the cheapest Croatia, Bosnia is simply paradise. Everything is very cheap. Bread costs from $0.60 to $1 (2 Bosnian marks = 1 euro). In Travnik, a scoop of ice cream costs $0.30.

Opposite the fortress it is written “Srebrenica, we will not forget, we will not forgive.” Srebrenica is a city near the border with Serbia, where the Serbs killed almost the entire Muslim population during the war.

Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of two parts: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska, which live practically separately. Both parts of the country issue their own money. On Serbian money there are Serbian heroes, on federal money there are Bosnian and Croatian heroes. On Serbian money there is an inscription on top in Cyrillic, on Bosnian money there is only a Latin inscription.

<h2>Jajce</h2>
<p>
There is a city in Bosnia with the funny name Jajce, which, oddly enough, means “egg”. This city could have been a tourist mecca if it had not been destroyed by war and was not located far from the coast. The main feature is a twenty-meter waterfall in the city center, an absolutely unique place for Europe.
<p/>

<p>
There is such a very popular place in Croatia, Plitvice Lakes. I looked at photographs from there a lot, and could not understand why everyone was going there, what was special there. Well, in some photographs the color of the water is unnatural, which is probably a product of Photoshop filters, but otherwise it looks like an ordinary forest in the Moscow region (in <a href="../zaraisk">Zaraisk</a >, for example). But Jajce is really great.
<p/>

The waterfall used to be even higher, but was damaged by shelling during the war

During World War II, Tito's headquarters was here (in this basement).

<p>
Then there was the 1992 war, all Serbs were expelled from here. Their houses are destroyed.

Next to the house there is wood harvesting. This surprised me back in Croatia, when you drive past small towns, there are woodpiles everywhere, apparently not everywhere has gas.

<h2>Sarajevo</h2>
<p>
If you ask me what is the most interesting city in Yugoslavia, I will answer without hesitation: “Sarajevo”. This is a unique city that combines east and west, even more so than <a href="../istanbul">Istanbul</a>: after all, Istanbul’s European elements belong more to the past than to the present, and Sarajevo is indeed a half Christian, half Muslim city.
<p/>

Few people know that the Second World War began with a provocation in the Polish city of Gliwice (Gleiwitz), but everyone knows that the First World War began with seven shots in Sarajevo. Here, on June 28, 1914, Gavrilo Princip assassinated Franz Ferdinand, and on June 28, 2014, I visited this place.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254735497_221f1c999b_o.jpg">
<p>
In honor of the anniversary, a car was parked at that very spot (not the original one, the original one is kept in Vienna), and it was possible to take photographs.
<p/>

Previously, in the place where Princip stood, there were his sole prints, but then this slab was moved to the museum next door.

<p>
Franz Ferdinand was driving from the barracks to the city hall. The conspirators planned to blow up the car with a grenade, and threw it near the scene of the murder, near a nearby bridge, but missed, killing only passers-by. The Archduke went to the town hall.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256511090_eb5d6c90a3_o.jpg">
<p>
From there, after a short conversation with the mayor, he decided to go to the hospital to see those wounded by the explosion. Near the Latin Bridge, the driver mistakenly turned right; while he was turning the car back, Princip managed to shoot at Franz Ferdinand.

<p>
The fate of the house where the terrorist lived is interesting. The Austrian authorities destroyed it. But after the war, Sarajevo became part of Yugoslavia, and the Serbs, who considered Princip a hero, rebuilt it, opening a museum there. Then in 1941, when the Croatian Ustasha-Nazis came, the house was destroyed again, and under Tito after the war it was restored. Finally, in 1992, the house was destroyed for the third time, for now completely. Still, just when I was in Sarajevo, in the eastern part of the city, where the Serbs live, a monument to Princip was unveiled.
The last war greatly affected the appearance of Sarajevo. But just a few years before, the Olympics were held there, and nothing foreshadowed trouble.

The predominantly Muslim city found itself surrounded by Serbian forces. The only supply channel for the besieged was the tunnel that led to the airport.

There is only a small section left of the tunnel, a couple of tens of meters, ending in a dead end on both sides. But it gives an idea of what happened there.

The striking cemetery is located on the hillside below the fortress. If you wander around there, it’s easy to notice that on almost all the graves the date of death is 1993-1995...

<h2>Mostar</h2>
<p>
In the Bosnian war, everyone fought against everyone. The city of Mostar found itself at the center of the struggle between Muslim Bosnians and Croats. The Bosnians and Croats lived on opposite sides of the river, and thoroughly destroyed each other. The famous Ottoman-era bridge, the symbol of the city, was destroyed.

<p>
Now the remains of that bridge can be seen in a small park on the Croatian side.
<p/>

And the bridge was restored according to diagrams and photographs.

By the way, this is not the only such bridge in the city.
<p/>

<p>
From here it is not far to Croatian resorts, so excursion groups come by bus. Local souvenir shops and cafes even accept Croatian money.

You can swim under the bridge, but this is for the brave.

The fact is that this is a mountain river, and the water here is icy even on a hot summer day. That's why everyone stands on the rocks and doesn't swim.
<p/>

The views are gorgeous.

There is a cross on the mountain. In principle, you can get there in a couple of hours, but I was lazy.

Let's walk around the city. A typical Bosnian tombstone of an important person.

The graves are simpler. All these people died in 1993 during the fighting.
<p/>

The street is in honor of the hero of those battles, whose name Russian speakers will really like.

There is a lot of destruction to this day.

On the Croatian side, some houses have literally been turned into a sieve; there is no living space left.

On the Bosnian side, some houses have been destroyed by heavy artillery, so that only the walls remain standing.

Abandoned. They just put up a new sign.

And they warned about the danger of collapse.

The road sign has been shot many times. How did Artemy Lebedev not take it into his collection?

But despite the destruction, the city is rising due to tourism, so everything is pretty good here.

<h2>Neum</h2>
<p>
Bosnia's only seaside town cuts off Dubrovnik from the rest of Croatia. Before Croatia joined Schengen, there was no control when transiting through Neum; now, at the entrance to Neum, the Croatian border guard walked around, looked at passports, and on leaving he simply got on the bus, looked at it and got off.
<p/>

The city is similar to Croatian coastal cities.
<p/>

But there are also Bosnian features, such as dead underground passages.
