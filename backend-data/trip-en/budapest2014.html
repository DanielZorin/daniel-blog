<h1>Hungary: Budapest, Szentendre, Eger</h1>
<i>20-22 October 2014</i>
<h2>Budapest</h2>
<p>
What could be better than a weekend trip to Europe when tickets cost pennies? The euro then cost less than 50 rubles. And here I am in Budapest for the fourth time, this time not passing through, unlike the previous two.

<p>
For a ridiculous 18 euros a day we rented an apartment in the Jozsefváros area. The house turned out to have a courtyard.
<p/>

<p>
In different areas of Budapest the signs are slightly different.
<p/>

<p>
I hadn’t reached this area on previous occasions, but it turned out to be very nice.

<p>
I like Budapest more and more every time.

<p>
There is also a crisis in Hungary; there are as many homeless people on the streets and in the passages as always.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256171278_18c4b5423a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Finally visited the Kerepesi cemetery.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257014065_57336a608c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In this cemetery, instead of crosses, slabs and obelisks, sculptures are placed.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256719789_8c4fc4b961_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And sculptural compositions.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256171438_ad2215c0d9_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257471914_e6db5a0f2b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Some graves are surrounded by greenery.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255241177_83cc4f73a2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At the same time, there is still quite a lot of free space in the cemetery, which is surprising for the center of a large city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255241207_b14cd0c0dc_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256726446_eee86234dc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Only in one corner are obelisks collected.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256719964_ba45110522_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And there is also a piece of a Soviet memorial burial.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256719994_8c160e0e26_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p>
The rest of the time in the city was devoted to pleasure. One of them is spa where I didn't take my camera. I highly recommend the spa, better than any sea.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255970446_2c22e0c114_h.jpg"/>
<p>
All the pleasures - Tokaj, Eger, palinka and sangria to quench your thirst.
<p/>

<p>
Come to vacation in Budapest!
<p/>
<h2>Szentendre</h2>
<p>
It took me four visits to Budapest to go to the closest historical town - Szentendre.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256632150_47be2f0ba6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Yes, it is a beautiful, well-kept city.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255586666_e7103ccd55_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The walls are covered with ivy.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256335814_7b320d3378_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Hung with gardening tools.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255586491_028bec743e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The streets are paved.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255791953_c409c63013_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Narrow.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256632125_d384023326_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256842526_435bf37798_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And they quickly end at the embankment.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254856737_2316bd6855_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also an embankment near the stream.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254856537_3bfcf1ad95_h.jpg"/>
<p>
For some reason, the inscription on the cafe is in Serbian. In the evening the party is in Budapest, not here.
<p/>

<h2>Eger</h2>
<p>
There are two most famous types of wine in Hungary. One of them is red, it is made in the city of Eger. The second is white, it is produced in Tokaj, which is even further to the east.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256833724_1eef1190e0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Overall, Eger is a fairly typical Hungarian city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256285528_15f7034237_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are commie blocks here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257782455_845e756a10_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Turul.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256833609_af5ee26c77_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Relief plaques with the unchanged Széchenyi Street.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256833649_1593faee5b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Monuments to heroes.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256285663_73c78dc029_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Churches.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256012017_04bf5a502f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Giant churches.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256285538_ce371d8063_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Soviet souvenirs.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257129110_d7e7d449a2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But Eger is the first Hungarian city I have visited that has a medieval castle (not counting Buda Castle in Budapest).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256285618_6819556250_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are cannons in the castle...
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256833794_235f205719_h.jpg"/>
<p>
...and playgrounds.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257129180_51b73c16ad_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And a view of the city. By the way, here is the northernmost ancient minaret in Europe, left over from the times when Hungary was conquered by Turkey.
<p/>

<h2>Fuzesabony</h2>
<p>
Hungarian Bumfuck.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257154370_7b64b40219_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here, just like in Russian towns, you can see a water pump on the street.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256859359_bfc6c71611_h.jpg"/>
<p>

Monument to Great Hungary.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257785845_98fe159779_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The station looks too cool for this town.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257154415_8fe6190db1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But the glass cabinet for the timetable at the station has not been changed for forty years.
