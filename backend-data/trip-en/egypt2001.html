<h1>Egypt: Hurghada</h1>
<i>March 31 - April 8, 2001</i>
<p>
The first time I was in Egypt was back in 2001, in Hurghada. I remember that we took off with some difficulty, because there were many more people wanting to get on the plane than there were seats (apparently, there were two flights, but one was cancelled). I don’t remember what the hotel looked like, but we went to the market in the center of Hurghada once, and I didn’t go on long excursions.
