<h1>Rwanda: Kigali</h1>
<i>18-19 July 2024</i>
<h2>Road</h2>
<p>
After the border, I sat comfortably on the bus near the window and prepared to enjoy the views. The road was about 200 kilometers, and the bus went straight to Kigali without transfers. One downside - it was slow, stopping at every post, so the road took more than 6 hours, and by the end I was a bit tired. But the views were still magnificent.
<p/>

<p>
Rwanda is called "the country of a thousand hills", the roads here are winding, like in Georgia.

<p>
Often there are fields with palm trees.

<p>
The roads in Rwanda are simply excellent.

<p>
What surprised me most was the presence of bike paths in the villages.
<p/>

<p>
Bicycles are popular here.
<p/>

<p>
There are often springs where people come on bicycles with canisters to collect water. The canisters are always bright yellow.

<p>
Also at the entrance to each village there are signs like these.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946365339_000fc6b78e_o.jpg" >
<p>
It is not clear what is written - in Rwanda the signs are mainly in the Kinyarwanda language. This is a rare example of an African country where the local language is much more popular than the colonial language, since there is only one language here, while in most countries there are many languages, and European languages ​​are needed as a lingua franca. Rwanda, by the way, was a colony of Belgium, and the official language was French for a long time, but in the 21st century it was replaced by English, starting from school.
<p/>

<p>
But wait, if there is only one language here, who are the two peoples, the Hutu and the Tutsi, who hated each other so much that a terrible genocide occurred? This is a long and complicated history, which, however, in light of recent events, can easily be tried on for yourself.
<p/>

Kilometer stones remain from the French influence here.

When the road goes down into the valley, there are often flooded fields nearby, just like in Asia.

<h2>Kigali</h2>
<p>
The capital of Rwanda, as expected, is one of the most modern and well-maintained cities in Africa. Like the rest of Rwanda, Kigali is built on hills, making getting around a bit tiring.
<p/>
