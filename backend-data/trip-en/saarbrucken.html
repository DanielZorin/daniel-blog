<h1>Germany: Perl, Saarbrücken, Frankfurt am Main</h1>
<i>11-12 April 2024</i>
<h2>Perl</h2>
<p>
Walking across the bridge, I ended up in Germany, the city of Perl, Saarland province.

Next was a climb up the hill to the city center.

<p>
Central square. From here a bus runs approximately once an hour to the Merzig train station. There is a station in this town, but trains from there go more towards France.

<p>
I spent most of the hour trying to buy a bus ticket, first in the regional carrier’s app (it froze at the stage of entering the card number), then finally bought it through the main Deutsche Bahn app.

<h2>Saarbrücken</h2>
<p>
Saarland is one of three German states where I have not been (the other two are Mecklenburg and Saxony-Anhalt, which I actually passed through in transit). I didn’t think I’d end up here, I probably wouldn’t have made a special trip, but it turned out to be just along the way. It is the smallest state in Germany and is remarkable mainly for its history. Coal was previously mined here, and in the 19th and 20th centuries it was a strategically important region. After the First World War, under the Treaty of Versailles, Saarland was occupied by French troops for 15 years. Coal went to France as reparations. 15 years later, in 1935, a plebiscite was held in Saarland, as a result of which the region united with Germany. After 1945 it was occupied again, and finally returned to Germany in 1957 (in 1955 there was a referendum where residents voted against independence).

Bridge. Looks tough.

<p>
The metallurgical plant in the city of Völklingen, a suburb of Saarbrücken, looks even more brutal.
<p/>

<p>
The plant operated until 1986, and now it is a museum. It's a pity that I didn't have enough time to go inside.

The Saarbrücken train station is called "Eurostation", the inscription with the name of the city is not visible.

<p>
For the first time during the trip, I checked into a hotel; I had been renting apartments in France all the time. The hotel was nice, there was even a coffee machine with capsules.
<p/>

<p>
I bought some cheese. Now in Germany cheese is more expensive than in France (it used to be the same or a little cheaper).
<p/>

Next to the station is a typical German shopping area.

There is a small castle on the other side of the river.

The bus station has a cool design. If you look at it directly, nothing is clear.
<p/>

<p>
But if you are in a car and looking from the side at an angle, then these letters show which side to enter and exit the parking lot.

<h2>Frankfurt am Main</h2>
<p>
I flew home from Frankfurt am Main airport. I transited through this airport twice: to <a href="../morocco1">Morocco</a> in 2012 and to <a href="../newark">USA in 2022</a>. On the first trip I also explored the city itself.

Frankfurt is probably the most emigrant city in Germany, along with Berlin. Right in the center you can find restaurants of any cuisine, shops with Chinese food, etc.

Skyscrapers. This is rare in Europe, but compared to American and Asian cities they are not very large.

The historical center has been preserved only in spots, so here old buildings can be found among post-war boxes.

Here a small bottle of cola costs 5 euros. And I complained in Istanbul that prices there were extortionate, although it was only 3 euros there.
