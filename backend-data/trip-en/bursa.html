<h1>Turkey: Istanbul, Bursa, Kütahya, Afyonkarahisar, Isparta</h1>
<i>3-9 January 2023</i>
<h2>Istanbul</h2>
<p>
I started 2023 with a short trip around Turkey - I flew to Istanbul and returned from there by land, visiting cities along the way. I haven't been to Istanbul for more than six months. Since then, hotels there have become cheaper, and food has become more expensive (as elsewhere in Turkey). I went to the recently renovated archaeological museum, located in an alley next to Topkapi Palace.

This time I lived in the very center south of the tram line, approximately at the level of the Grand Bazaar. The downside is that you have to climb a hill, but otherwise it's ok. It's not deserted at night.

<p>
I went to the Malay restaurant again, this time the prices didn’t seem high to me, it seems they were raised proactively in December 2021, and haven’t changed much since then. This huge seafood platter (called Mee Hailam) cost 140 lira.

<h2>Bursa</h2>
<p>
Bursa is the fourth largest city in Turkey, the largest I had not been to. Bursa is quite close to Istanbul, you can go there even as a day trip. From the European part of Istanbul, the fastest way is by ferries departing from the central piers to the northern suburbs of Bursa, from where the center is 20-30 kilometers away. From the Asian side it may be faster to take a bus, depending on how far it is to the bus station.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52628460131_1568e3c3f2_h.jpg"/>

<p>
The ferry arrives in the city of Mudanya, famous for the fact that the armistice between Turkey and Greece was signed here in 1922.

The cable car only worked until the second intermediate station, the third was closed. As I understand it, near the third station there is a ski resort with lifts, which did not work due to lack of snow.

There are a lot of people on the main street, but if you go a little to the side or higher, there is no one.

It turns out that the dish “Iskender kebab” comes from Bursa, and here it is simply called Bursa kebab. It was invented by a man named Iskender in the early 20th century. Iskender kebab is served on cut flatbread, with ketchup and yogurt.

<h2>Kütahya</h2>
<p>
The city of Kütahya  is located in the center of Turkey, somewhere between Bursa, Antalya and Ankara. One notable thing here is a large castle on a hill, as is the case in many cities in Turkey.

The old city begins below. There are still some crumbling houses here and there, apparently because the city is not so popular that it would warrant rebuilding everything.

<p>
At the entrance to the bus station there is a monument to a man on a horse above a globe. Leaving the bus station, I took a picture of him from the window of a taxi, thinking that it was Ataturk. While I was waiting for the bus, I went to take a closer look and take a better photo, it turned out that it was traveler Evliya Celebi.

<h2>Afyonkarahisar</h2>
<p>
I didn’t expect much from the city of Afyonkarahisar, but it turned out that it is one of the best preserved historical cities in Turkey, no worse than <a href="../ankara">Safranbolu</a> or <a href="../sanliurfa">Urfa</a>.

For once, the bus station in a Turkish city is not in the middle of nowhere, but only 2 kilometers from the center. But, alas, a new one is already being built at the end of the world, judging by the maps.
