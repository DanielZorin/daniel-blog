<h1>Turkey: Istanbul, Bursa, Kütahya, Afyonkarahisar, Isparta</h1>
<i>3-9 January 2023</i>
<h2>Istanbul</h2>
<p>
I started 2023 with a short trip around Turkey - I flew to Istanbul and returned from there by land, visiting cities along the way. I haven't been to Istanbul for more than six months. Since then, hotels there have become cheaper, and food has become more expensive (as elsewhere in Turkey). I went to the recently renovated archaeological museum, located in an alley next to Topkapi Palace.

This time I lived in the very center south of the tram line, approximately at the level of the Grand Bazaar. The downside is that you have to climb a hill, but otherwise it's ok. It's not deserted at night.

I went to the Malay restaurant again, this time the prices didn’t seem high to me, it seems they were raised proactively in December 2021, and haven’t changed much since then. This huge seafood platter (called Mee Hailam) cost 140 lira.

<h2>Bursa</h2>
<p>
Bursa is the fourth largest city in Turkey, the largest I had not been to. Bursa is quite close to Istanbul, you can go there even as a day trip. From the European part of Istanbul, the fastest way is by ferries departing from the central piers to the northern suburbs of Bursa, from where the center is 20-30 kilometers away. From the Asian side it may be faster to take a bus, depending on how far it is to the bus station.
<p/>

<p>
The ferry arrives in the city of Mudanya, famous for the fact that the armistice between Turkey and Greece was signed here in 1922.

It turns out that the dish “Iskender kebab” comes from Bursa, and here it is simply called Bursa kebab. It was invented by a man named Iskender in the early 20th century. Iskender kebab is served on cut flatbread, with ketchup and yogurt.
