<h1>Brazil: Brasilia, Chapada dos Veadeiros</h1>
<i>24-30 April 2021</i>
<h2>Brasilia</h2>
<p>
The capital of Brazil is a city built from scratch according to a strict plan, similar to the capitals of <a href="../sydney">Australia</a>, <a href="../kuala-lumpur">Malaysia</a>, <a href="../delhi">Indian state of Punjab</a> as well as the capitals of Pakistan, Myanmar and Kazakhstan, where I have not yet been.
<p/>

<p>
Brasilia is shaped like a bird, or a longbow. All government agencies, shopping centers, hotels, museums, etc. are located on the axis/body, and the “wings” on the north and south are residential.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51331870617_b5bf1e960a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I lived in a hotel, and they are all located in two hotel blocks, one north of the axis, one south.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256696014_91bde30776_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The city was originally built for cars, so there are long distances, but in principle you can walk. Crossings are not everywhere, but it is easy to cross the road while a red traffic light is on somewhere.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256990115_d2f4d26a4f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The hotel district is almost in the very center, the residential wings begin just above it, and there are also intersections of the axis with the avenues passing through the wings.
<p/>

<p/>

<p>
In the middle of the axis is a large lawn.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255946716_4a390b1654_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The TV tower, the ascent to which was closed due to coronavirus.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255217572_1a135d7e21_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is the middle of the axis, it is logical that a transport hub for buses, a metro, and also an intersection of main highways was made here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256148108_c7661a04b1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The central station is full of lively trade from the ground.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255217652_aa240a7313_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But ordinary streets one block from the axis are no longer very busy, sometimes even uncomfortable, but still there are not as many shady personalities in this city as in Rio and São Paulo.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255947141_1feb1914d0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In addition to hotels, there are office blocks in the central zone.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255218057_650d9ccf8e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
All these are monuments of the era of modernism.

<p>
Beyond the intersection with the wings, the esplanade of ministries begins.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256990960_fe19cf64fc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Along the way there is a completely empty square with a museum.
<p/>

<p/>

<p>
And the famous cathedral. It is mostly underground, this is a dome.

<p>
Somehow the architects did not provide for restaurants in the government area, maybe there is something inside, but obviously not enough, because in the ministry area there are mobile vans and food carts during the day.

<p>
The residential areas are all approximately the same - these are squares in which there are low apartment buildings. All houses are basically on “legs”, but not for parking, because... parking is around the perimeter or underground.
<p/>

<p>
One side of the square is reserved for restaurants, shops, laundries, hairdressers, etc. This is always the side along which the border with the next square passes, so if you go from north to south, the cross streets will be shopping streets one after another.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51333600710_fc77216f6a_h.jpg"/>

<p>
Some of the shopping streets were quite deserted due to the coronavirus (they had to close early at night).
<p/>

In addition to the center, I visited some other places in the capital of Brazil, fortunately I had a car and advice from my local friend. Visiting Andrey in the Varjão area north of the northern wing.
<p/>

South of Varjão soon begins a very rich and expensive area on the shores of the northern part of the lake. There are rich houses behind fences. Surprisingly, some fences are solid, just like in Russia. Although these may be non-residential buildings that are being built or sold.

<h2>Alto Paraiso de Goiás</h2>
<p>
To visit Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park, I rented a car for the first time in Brazil. The park is located in the state of Goiás, from which a rectangle of land was allocated for the capital. The drive is approximately 250 kilometers. The first stop was at the border of the state of Goiás and the capital district. The metropolitan area is quite large and there is no longer any development on the outskirts, so the sign is simply on the road.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255275737_f67b554961_h.jpg"/>

<p>
The center of the capital is 60 kilometers away.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256206008_2992e2cb14_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In Brazil, the markings are yellow, like in the USA.
<p/>

There are fields around where they grow something.

There is a strange tradition in Brazil - pots, pans and basins are constantly sold along the highways.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256005201_3f2952781a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On the 250-kilometer route to the national park, there are only three settlements: São Gabriel de Goiás, São João d'Aliança and Alto Paraiso de Goiás, the rest of the road is absolutely empty, there are no villages or gas stations/recreation areas. The population density is comparable to the desert state <a href="../new-mexico">New Mexico</a>. This is the first city of São Gabriel.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256754114_60f24542f3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Looks similar to American cities along the roads - also a lot of shops on the wide main street.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255275812_02d73fe26f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
São Gabriel is small, but truckers seem to stop there, so there are more restaurants. On the way back we had dinner there, and not in the larger São João d'Aliança, where everything was closed at 7 pm.

This alley is the entrance to a fazenda (estate). Also similar to the USA, where there are many large farms far from cities.

The last city of Alto Paraiso is the "capital of chapada". You can stay in a hotel there, but there are closer options in the village of São Jorge at the very entrance to the park.
<p/>

In addition to the state national park, there are quite a few treks in this region and on other (private) territories. These are the Almecegas waterfalls.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255276047_f6c8d3bb21_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The landscape as a whole is like this. Getting here without a car is quite difficult, since from the highway you have to drive another 7 kilometers along a dirt road.
<p/>

This is the river itself, you can swim in it.
<p/>

<p>
There is also a second smaller waterfall, to which you need to drive another three kilometers.

By the time we got there and looked at the waterfalls, the day came to an end. It gets dark very early in Brazil, around 6-7 o'clock.

<h2>Chapada dos Veadeiros</h2>
<p>
The part of the Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park accessible to tourists is located next to the village of São Jorge. In principle, you can get there without a car by taking a bus or Blablacar, but not during the coronavirus, when there is much less transport. São Jorge is such a village that there are not even asphalt roads, you waddle through puddles.
<p/>

<p>
It’s also quite expensive there, for one night I paid 180 reais even without air conditioning (in Brasilia in the very center I paid only 100), and I couldn't find a place right away - some are closed, some require a minimum of 2 nights. Restaurants are also twice as expensive as in ordinary cities.

The entrance to the national park is about a kilometer and a half away. Admission costs R$36, but I passed for a local (thanks to CPF) and got a half-price ticket. The trek takes about 5-6 hours. Moreover, most of the route goes through the forest, and there is even a road there (gravel), I’m sure that in the USA they would definitely cut the route in half, making parking closer to the waterfalls.

After walking another kilometer along the shore, you can swim under another rather large waterfall.

From here there is a direct path to the exit.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256006436_4d2328bc1e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Near the exit there is also a small trek of about 15 minutes to a small waterfall.

There were still a few hours left before sunset, so I managed to stop by another interesting place nearby - the “Moon Valley” (Vale da Lua).

You can go lower, but it is somewhat risky, so there is no insurance, and the height is quite high.

In fact, this is a slot canyon, like the famous Antelope Canyon in America, only here it is in the process of creation, and in America there is no longer a river at the bottom of the canyon.
