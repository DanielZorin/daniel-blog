<h1>Armenia: Yerevan, Tatev, Garni, Spitak, Alaverdi</h1>
<i>14-20 June 2023</i>
<h2>Yerevan</h2>
<p>
I went to Armenia for a few days on business. I haven’t been to Armenia since my first trip back in <a href="../armenia">2014</a>. Recently, this country has changed a lot: in 2018 there was a revolution, in 2020 there was a war with Azerbaijan, which led to the de facto loss of most of Nagorno-Karabakh, and in 2022 there was an influx of migrants from Russia, so now Armenia is not at all that cheap and carefree country as I saw it almost 10 years ago. In Yerevan it is much more expensive than in Turkey and Georgia, I had difficulty finding an apartment for $40  not in the center, while in Tbilisi for $20-25 there are many options.

In Yerevan, in residential areas, houses made of pink tuff are well recognizable.

I live north of the center - less than 2 kilometers in a straight line, but this area is on a plateau that is much higher than the center, like <a href="../la-paz">El Alto and La Paz</a>
<p/>

But there are also quite luxurious mansions; apparently some of Yerevan’s rich people live here.

I walked around the center of Yerevan. It was built according to a regular plan during the Soviet era, but with a unique local flavor.

It’s nice that drinking fountains are very common in Armenia, even in residential areas in courtyards. For some reason they always work non-stop, and are not turned on by a button.

A monument to Garegin Nzhdeh, a fighter for the independence of Armenia in 1917-1920, appeared in the center of Yerevan. After the entry of Soviet troops into Armenia, he fled and settled in Bulgaria, and during the Second World War he collaborated with the Germans, which is why he is hated in Russia (although less than Stepan Bandera).

Tours in Armenia. The maps are old, including all of Karabakh (although Armenia never officially considered it part of itself). De facto, it is now almost impossible to get to Karabakh; the Azerbaijanis are blocking the road, which is why there are big problems with supplies there. Russian peacekeepers essentially cannot do anything; at the latest they will be expelled from there in 2025, when the mandate of the peacekeeping mission ends, but most likely some kind of agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan will be concluded earlier, negotiations are currently underway.
<p/>

Yerevan has cheap public transport - a bus ride costs only 100 drams ($0.25), for comparison in Tbilisi 1 lari ($0.40), and on old trolleybuses generally 50 drams.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53037289752_03e008aaa2_o.jpg">
<p>
But food in Yerevan is not particularly cheap. In the Karas chain, which seemed super cheap to me in 2014 (compared to Russia, which was then an expensive country), a kebab/shashlyk costs about 3,500 drams - $9. In Georgia, kebab costs 18 lari - $7.
<p/>

But tabbouleh salad costs a couple of dollars, although the taste here is somewhat different than in Arab countries.

In stores, almost all goods are from Russia with labels in Russian, as if you were in Pyaterochka. The prices seemed high to me, although I apparently compared this with what it was a year and a half ago, and now the difference is not so big.

<h2>Khor Virap - Noravank</h2>
<p>
Last time I explored Armenia by hitchhiking. Now I’m older and have traveled along a similar route on a tour bus. Last time I hitchhiked along the same (only) road to Karabakh, but did not visit some famous monasteries and cities along the way. The first region immediately south of Yerevan is the Ararat region, from where Mount Ararat is best visible (better than from <a href="../kars">Turkey and Iran</a>) .
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53037296787_8361018599_o.jpg">

<p>
This area is quite flat, with many fields and farms.

<p>
The capital of the region is the city of Artashat, one of the ancient capitals of Armenia. However, the modern city was built in the 20th century in a new location. Near Artashat there is one of the most famous monasteries in Armenia - Khor Virap.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53038265945_99b0264fda_o.jpg">
<p>
Khor Virap means "deep dungeon". It is believed that at the beginning of the 4th century, the Armenian king imprisoned Saint Gregory here, but later, when Gregory healed him, he converted to Christianity himself and adopted it as a religion for all of Armenia. The oldest church is this one, without a dome.

<h2>Garni</h2>
<p>
One day I went to the town of Garni near Yerevan - the only place (besides Yerevan itself) from my last trip that I visited again.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53038362843_f8724d90ab_o.jpg">
<p>
In Garni there is a temple listed as a World Heritage Site. Somehow at that time I did not fully realize that it is extremely rare to see a temple from the times of the Roman Empire that is not in a state of “a foundation and a couple of columns.” There are at most 10 such temples in the world, the largest are the Pantheon in Rome and the temple in <a href="../lebanon">Baalbek</a> in Lebanon.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53038063329_279cb8979c_o.jpg">

<h2>Spitak</h2>
<p>
The only region of Armenia that I didn't visit on my first trip, not even just passing through, was the Lori region, through which the main road from Yerevan to Tbilisi goes (back then I went along alternative roads through Lake Sevan and through Gyumri). First you need to drive through the Aragatsotn region (north of Yerevan).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53037871056_f5c5cab7f0_o.jpg">

<p>
The first more or less large city on the way to Tbilisi is called Aparan. When I was traveling from Tbilisi to Yerevan, there wasn't enough space in the cabin, so I sat in the luggage compartment (just like in Indonesia), and got off at Aparan to change to a more convenient local minibus for the last leg of the journey.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53038058769_ca0b3ac9dd_o.jpg">

Later it turned out that in Aparan excursion buses stop near the food court in the center.
