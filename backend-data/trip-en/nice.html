<h1>France: Nice, Cannes, Marseille</h1>
<i>11-14 March 2014</i>
<h2>Nice</h2>
<p>
Nice is considered an expensive luxury resort for the elite. As for the high cost, I would argue, in the city center I rented an excellent hotel for 30 euros, which is inexpensive for France (not on the beach, yeah), but there is enough <i>elite</i> here.

<p>
Only in Nice do chandeliers with rhinestones hang on the streets.

Majestic shopping experience.
<p/>

<p>
All this splendor is destroyed by the fact that the residents of Nice fundamentally do not clean up after their dogs.
<p/>

<p>
Externally, Nice looks more like Italy.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255837237_26bdb16d7f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Actually, this was Italy, until the rulers of Piedmont gave it to France in exchange for help in the fight against Austria in the mid-19th century. The most famous native of Nice was unhappy with this, because he was made into a foreigner in Italy.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256799816_92e3848a8c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also a local Provençal language, in which the inscriptions are sometimes duplicated.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257312499_28b1d2370d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Old Nice is a small triangle under a hill.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257607620_9f01119846_h.jpg"/>
<p>
New Nice stretches to the horizon.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257312624_ac8142b5d5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Promenade des Anglais.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257607585_9af9a5dd01_h.jpg"/>
<p>
As a beach, this place is not very good, there are pebbles and there is a highway nearby. But all the infrastructure is there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257608170_fab0504eb2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But as a promenade place it’s excellent.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256766848_c82f38c2d8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Buddha statues in the main square.

<p/>

<p>
The Statue of Liberty is also here.
<p/>

<p>
In the old days, Nice was the main Russian health resort. Now there are still a lot of Russians here, but not as many as in <a href="../cyprus">Cyprus</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256565011_f5404f2cb1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Several artifacts remain from the Russian nobles. Firstly, the Orthodox Church.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257842645_0f21e068fb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Secondly, the street where it stands.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255837577_5fa1c7a99d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Thirdly, there are several shops.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257000903_25659bc956_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also a grocery store.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257607910_0a3e0f73bf_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I must say that the prices here are more decent than in Russian stores in Cyprus.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257608035_959ff88e5f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But there’s still not much to buy here, except perhaps Russian delicacies.
<p/>

<h2>Cannes</h2>
<p>
In Cannes, I finally saw the stereotypical Provence: people wear berets here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255993426_d79e59d43f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And they play petanque.
<p/>

<p>
A conference on real estate sales was taking place in the city, the buffet reception had just begun, and the whole center was packed with people in jackets with wine glasses
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256194393_ac9951a3d0_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>

<p>
The Cannes steps are occupied by a conference poster.
<p/>

<p>
Russia is the guest of honor.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255264022_4b72b7a7fc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Next to the stairs is a long row of handprints of famous actors and film directors. Although I’m not a film expert, I recognized many.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256194553_c69e497257_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In such places, I am always happy to realize that my handwriting is super neat and legible. Many people's cursive Latin script is hard to understand. Tarantino can be called a champion in this matter, however, his initials are so recognizable that it is not necessary to write down the remaining letters.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256194493_6db5d5f3d0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Unlike Nice, the beach in Cannes is sandy.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257037060_3c9a55c04e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It's called Croisette.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256194433_92dc8ad229_h.jpg"/>
<p>
From above you can see that Cannes is now primarily a cinema on the beach.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256742934_c7a78eef0f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The city is extensively built up with villas.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257037220_1ada941ead_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It used to be a small fishing village on a hill. It was famous mainly due to the fact that here (more precisely on the island of St. Margaret, which can be seen in the distance in the photo from the beach above) the man in the iron mask was imprisoned. This is reflected in Dumas' novel. Although many confuse the Iron Mask and the Count of Monte Cristo, believing that he lived in the Chateau d'If in Marseille.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255264157_cfc75108d6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Painting is not the theme of the festival.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256742864_b803d62f02_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The monument to heroes is understandable.
<p/>

<p>
Garbage cans, although from afar I would have mistaken this building for a stall.
<p/>

<h2>Marseille</h2>
<p>
For some reason, Marseille has a very bad reputation. The city is associated with garbage, crowds of migrants and shootings, although this is completely untrue. Of course, this is not the resort town of Nice or a quiet Provençal village, but a city with a population of a few million, but for its size, Marseille looks decent and very nice.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257173269_360b3d5f29_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are no more migrants in Marseille than in <a href="../paris">Paris</a>. In the city center they are concentrated in the market area. Of course, I lived there because there are cheap hotels there.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256426471_f997d590b0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
For some reason, Ukraine has found its way into the warm company of African countries.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256056672_4a420afe11_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Prices on the Marseille market are unusually low for Europe. 25 rubles a bottle of cola is a good price for Russia, for example.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255697027_b105ed5c98_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Of course, if you look in a dark corner, there will be garbage and the smell of urine.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257468715_325d222dbf_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But let's look at this tree planter right across from this corner. If this happened in <a href="../belgium">Brussels</a>, it would be full to the brim with garbage. So Marseille is certainly much cleaner than Brussels.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257173234_db9290e10a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is an old piece of Marseille that is beautiful, like small French towns.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255697192_cb764d8232_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Napoleon lived here when he was an officer.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256056552_180274c600_h.jpg"/>
<p>
As in Paris and <a href="../vienna">Vienna</a>, the city is divided into districts that are numbered from 1.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256625583_af73013985_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The cathedral is closed for reconstruction.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257173279_8c2fde43d6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The newer part of the city has long, straight streets.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257469235_61ea42c58d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A lot of cars.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257469275_b10cb0af9b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
All sorts of fashionable entertainment.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255697107_7cb07e98ae_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Branded French trams.
<p/>

<p>
Modern Art.

<p>
A small beach called Catalan in honor of the Catalan fishermen who lived in the area (this fact was also mentioned in the book “The Count of Monte Cristo”).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256625748_e65f5c016a_h.jpg"/>

<p>
By the way, about the Count of Monte Cristo. He was imprisoned in the Chateau d'If, located on an island near Marseille. For some reason, many people mistakenly believe that the man in the iron mask was held there a century earlier (in fact, it was in <a href="../nice">Cannes</a>) , so we can say that the Chateau d'If is famous for two prisoners, one of whom has never been there, and the other is completely fictional.
<p/>

<p>
A visit to Marseille would be incomplete without a panoramic view of the city. It can be seen closest to the center from the entrance to the harbor, where the palace of Napoleon III stands.
<p/>

<p>
But it is better to go up to the Notre-Dame de la Garde church.
<p/>

<p>
Fishermen have long blessed their boats in the church, and now they hang special signs with gratitude.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255697582_2d1a5b34e3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is the best view.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257173629_038ad25435_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256625818_1761678055_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The city is located on the hills. In the vicinity of Marseille there are French "fjords" called calanques.
<p/>

<p>

<p>
The large white rectangular building in the center is Le Corbusier's "Rainbow City", the very first house that implemented the concept of life under one roof, when home, school, hospital, work, etc. everything is located in one building. About the same as in the Main Building of Moscow State University. We can say that this is the world's first commie block.
