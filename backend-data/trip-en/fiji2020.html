<h1>Fiji: Nadi</h1>
<i>19-20 January 2020</i>
<h2>Nadi</h2>
<p>
Between Vanuatu and Samoa, I had a layover in Fiji, the main hub of the region. I had already been to Fiji <a href="../fiji">less than a year ago</a>, and traveled around the entire main island. The layover was long and included an overnight stay, so I booked a room for $12 on airbnb near the airport. It was a bit far from the airport - you need to go by bus or car, but within walking distance from the center of Nadi.

The place turned out to be a small village near the Nadi bypass.

Or a cottage village, since no one had personal plots.

I went into town to have dinner. Since it was Sunday, the banks were closed, I didn’t want to withdraw a large amount from an ATM, and therefore I could only eat whereever cards were accepted for payment, that is, only in one of several fast food joints.

It got dark earlier than I expected, and almost everything was closed, the city was uncomfortable, so I didn’t really walk around Nadi, especially since I around saw this city last time.

As usual, during takeoff and landing, the island of Viti Levu was clearly visible.

I saw this island before, but there is no such thing as too much beauty.
