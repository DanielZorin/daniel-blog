I expected that it might be cool on Sakhalin, but I didn’t think it would be this cold. There was a snowstorm for several days before my arrival, no planes were flying, so I was lucky. The most important thing was skiing and snowboarding, and this was after I walked around in Vladivostok in just a T-shirt.

They are going to make a base on Sakhalin to prepare the Russian team for the next Olympic Games, which will be held in Korea.

You can ride the ski lifts without equipment; there is a special excursion ticket for this.

At the top it was simply hellishly cold; in Moscow in January it is usually warmer.

Because of the snowstorm, everything was up to our ears in snow. Cafe.

Without any equipment, I froze and ran down to the intermediate lift station.

From here you can see Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk in full view.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256812270_2a30fb5282_o.jpg">
<p>
It would be something to look at.
<p/>

<p>
As we know, the southern half of Sakhalin belonged to Japan from 1905 to 1945. Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk was originally called Toyohara and was built next to the former Russian capital of Sakhalin, Vladimirovka. As in <a href="../kaliningrad">Kaliningrad</a>, almost nothing remains from the previous owners. The fighting on Sakhalin, of course, was not as intense as in East Prussia, but almost all the buildings of the Japanese period were wooden and simply burned down. Since I had more than enough time, I found all three buildings left from the Japanese. One - a local history museum.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255038552_bd43291e48_o.jpg">
<p>
Two - an art museum.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255971463_f26167ded9_o.jpg">
<p>
Three - the military prosecutor's office.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256517554_17714834d4_o.jpg">
<p>
This building is the hardest to find, it is in a courtyard in a residential area.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256517579_62187e1e2c_o.jpg">
<p>
There is one more thing left from the Japanese: the railway. Even the inexperienced naked eye can see that there is a narrow gauge here. After Sakhalin returned to the USSR, they did not change the rails, but continued to build a road on the northern part of the island with the same track. Now, for the most part, there are few passenger railroads, in particular, the famous Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk - Kholmsk section, where you can look at the Japanese “Devil's Bridge” if you walk ten kilometers on foot (not in this weather, of course), has been abandoned. There is a daily train across the island to the city of Nogliki. It seems that the rails are going to be changed to standard Russian gauge.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255767381_32a453816c_o.jpg">
<p>
Otherwise, there is still a noticeably increased number of Japaneseized names of shops and cafes.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255038607_709e91482d_o.jpg">
<p>
Modern Sakhalin is considered a fairly prosperous region because there is oil there. Oil is extracted in the harsh conditions of the north of the island, where they go on shifts, and everyone rests in the South. Due to the oil business, the city has a community of expats, whose cottages can be seen if you drive along the highway to Korsakov. There are also a certain number of shopping centers on the outskirts, and all signs with street names are duplicated in English.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256811845_f3988edca7_o.jpg">
<p>
There are expensive hotels on Sakhalin, but there is one cheap one - "Dalnevostochnik" on the station square.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256516579_7240914549_o.jpg">
<p>
For just 550 rubles I got into a double room. The hotel is a real museum of the Soviet Union.
<p/>

<p>
But from the window there is a gorgeous view of the Lenin monument.
<p/>

<p>
Everything is expensive on Sakhalin, much more expensive than in Moscow, which, however, is not surprising: delivery by sea or by plane is expensive. But here you can taste authentic Japanese instant noodles relatively cheaply (30-60 rubles), after which Doshirak and Rollton are no longer needed.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256517674_69b0fd230f_o.jpg">
<p>
Despite the presence of foreigners and English-language signs, in general Sakhalin has a distinguished culture.
<p/>

The city is mostly made up of Khrushchev-era buildings.

Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Airport remains from Soviet times and is now completely unable to cope with the load.

<p>
In the evenings I watched local television, where they mainly discussed how the fight against the consequences of the snowstorm was going on. I can say that in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk public utilities are working normally. The main streets have been more or less cleared to make it possible to walk through.
<p/>

Well, for lovers of destruction and other stalkers, I can advise you to walk from the exit from the station to the right, there is a whole block lying in ruins ready for demolition, and, apparently, it has been lying there for several years.

<h2>Korsakov</h2>
<p>
The name of the city of Korsakov is pronounced with an accent on “A”, in contrast to the surname of the famous composer. Korsakov (Otomari) was the first capital of Japanese Sakhalin, and now it is the dirtiest city I have ever met, worse than <a href="../indonesia-1">Jakarta</a>, <a href="../belgium">Brussels</a>, <a href="../morocco1">Casablanca</a> and other garbage dumps.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256481463_6998231c64_o.jpg">
<p>
Of course, the weather was not very good, but a simple comparison with neighboring Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk shows that in Korsakov there is no street cleaning as a fact.
<p/>

In some places you swim in puddles.

<p/>

In the warm season, Korsakov is probably even a little picturesque, like Vladivostok.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255980307_64264c2275_o.jpg">

There are quite a lot of Koreans on Sakhalin. They were brought by the Japanese, because... At that time, Korea was a Japanese colony, but in 1945 they did not evacuate, so they remained on Sakhalin.

<h2>Novosibirsk</h2>
<p>
After walking along the streets of Novosibirsk, you need to wash off a thick layer of dust from your face, picked up from cars on the local 9,000-lane highways.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256776698_9efe80c058_o.jpg">

A day earlier, the problem of dust was irrelevant, but the problem of puddles was very relevant.

There is a strange map hanging at the station, lost in time. Yes, the Yekaterinburg station is still called Sverdlovsk (and that’s what it says on tickets), but why Samara and not Kuibyshev? Petersburg, not St. Petersburg or Leningrad? And what is "Alma-Aty"?
