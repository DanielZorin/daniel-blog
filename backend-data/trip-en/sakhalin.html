I expected that it might be cool on Sakhalin, but I didn’t think it would be this cold. There was a snowstorm for several days before my arrival, no planes were flying, so I was lucky. The most important thing was skiing and snowboarding, and this was after I walked around in Vladivostok in just a T-shirt.

<p>
They are going to make a base on Sakhalin to prepare the Russian team for the next Olympic Games, which will be held in Korea.

<p>
You can ride the ski lifts without equipment; there is a special excursion ticket for this.

<p>
At the top it was simply hellishly cold; in Moscow in January it is usually warmer.
<p/>

<p>
Because of the snowstorm, everything was up to our ears in snow. Cafe.

<p>
Without any equipment, I froze and ran down to the intermediate lift station.

<p>
From here you can see Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk in full view.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256812270_86c33b21cb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It would be something to look at.
<p/>

<p>
As we know, the southern half of Sakhalin belonged to Japan from 1905 to 1945. Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk was originally called Toyohara and was built next to the former Russian capital of Sakhalin, Vladimirovka. As in <a href="../kaliningrad">Kaliningrad</a>, almost nothing remains from the previous owners. The fighting on Sakhalin, of course, was not as intense as in East Prussia, but almost all the buildings of the Japanese period were wooden and simply burned down. Since I had more than enough time, I found all three buildings left from the Japanese. One - a local history museum.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255038552_ef909be13f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Two - an art museum.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255971463_d0a67613fa_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Three - the military prosecutor's office.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256517554_77ace3dee3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This building is the hardest to find, it is in a courtyard in a residential area.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256517579_08caaf12e3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is one more thing left from the Japanese: the railway. Even the inexperienced naked eye can see that there is a narrow gauge here. After Sakhalin returned to the USSR, they did not change the rails, but continued to build a road on the northern part of the island with the same track. Now, for the most part, there are few passenger railroads, in particular, the famous Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk - Kholmsk section, where you can look at the Japanese “Devil's Bridge” if you walk ten kilometers on foot (not in this weather, of course), has been abandoned. There is a daily train across the island to the city of Nogliki. It seems that the rails are going to be changed to standard Russian gauge.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255767381_5139dd9628_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Otherwise, there is still a noticeably increased number of Japaneseized names of shops and cafes.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255038607_f1af2bedd1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Modern Sakhalin is considered a fairly prosperous region because there is oil there. Oil is extracted in the harsh conditions of the north of the island, where they go on shifts, and everyone rests in the South. Due to the oil business, the city has a community of expats, whose cottages can be seen if you drive along the highway to Korsakov. There are also a certain number of shopping centers on the outskirts, and all signs with street names are duplicated in English.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256811845_a5b9adcc22_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are expensive hotels on Sakhalin, but there is one cheap one - "Dalnevostochnik" on the station square.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256516579_cf4d2081d5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
For just 550 rubles I got into a double room. The hotel is a real museum of the Soviet Union.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256812445_762272e58e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But from the window there is a gorgeous view of the Lenin monument.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256517479_8930f3a6fd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Everything is expensive on Sakhalin, much more expensive than in Moscow, which, however, is not surprising: delivery by sea or by plane is expensive. But here you can taste authentic Japanese instant noodles relatively cheaply (30-60 rubles), after which Doshirak and Rollton are no longer needed.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256517674_e91fa604b0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Despite the presence of foreigners and English-language signs, in general Sakhalin has a distinguished culture.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256135487_ba3010e6ff_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The city is mostly made up of Khrushchev-era buildings.
<p/>

<p>
Khrushchev triptych (pay attention to the inscription).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255971153_53a4426935_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Attempts are being made to rectify the situation.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256516824_31178fd8c9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But many Khrushchev buildings continue to rust, like this Carlson.

I've always dreamed of a store like this.
<p/>

<p>
Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Airport remains from Soviet times and is now completely unable to cope with the load.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255767321_2d5098f485_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the evenings I watched local television, where they mainly discussed how the fight against the consequences of the snowstorm was going on. I can say that in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk public utilities are working normally. The main streets have been more or less cleared to make it possible to walk through.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256516619_d5dd4db6be_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It's getting worse in the courtyards.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255768051_b72a39f18e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
They didn't have time to lay tiles here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255768486_3772402e2d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The square with the monument was buried in the snow.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255767571_66e697474e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Suddenly culture.

<p>
Well, for lovers of destruction and other stalkers, I can advise you to walk from the exit from the station to the right, there is a whole block lying in ruins ready for demolition, and, apparently, it has been lying there for several years.

<h2>Korsakov</h2>
<p>
The name of the city of Korsakov is pronounced with an accent on “A”, in contrast to the surname of the famous composer. Korsakov (Otomari) was the first capital of Japanese Sakhalin, and now it is the dirtiest city I have ever met, worse than <a href="../indonesia-1">Jakarta</a>, <a href="../belgium">Brussels</a>, <a href="../morocco1">Casablanca</a> and other garbage dumps.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256481463_68514e8f49_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Of course, the weather was not very good, but a simple comparison with neighboring Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk shows that in Korsakov there is no street cleaning as a fact.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256283046_3ead21616b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Sidewalks in places too.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257029924_34d144f0bd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In some places you swim in puddles.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255552577_74c92b7aad_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In some places you walk through wet snow.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256283061_abea9ace56_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In some places it's muddy.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256283031_d9a0c000a4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the warm season, Korsakov is probably even a little picturesque, like Vladivostok.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255980307_dd271e5f42_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a port here, from where there is even passenger service to Japan.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256481558_56700e0939_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The other shore of Salmon Bay is visible.
<p/>

But the fucked up shows up close.

<p>
There are quite a lot of Koreans on Sakhalin. They were brought by the Japanese, because... At that time, Korea was a Japanese colony, but in 1945 they did not evacuate, so they remained on Sakhalin.

I couldn't stand walking around Korsakov for more than two hours. With completely wet boots I had to retreat to Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk.

<h2>Novosibirsk</h2>
<p>
After walking along the streets of Novosibirsk, you need to wash off a thick layer of dust from your face, picked up from cars on the local 9,000-lane highways.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256776698_727454dc7c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A day earlier, the problem of dust was irrelevant, but the problem of puddles was very relevant.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257322799_38aff399d7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The courtyards of Novosibirsk are not conducive to walking in the rain.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257617860_4716c9f5d1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And the streets, in fact, too.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256776443_221af9f52b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It's not all that bad at all. There is a small historical center in Novosibirsk, about a hundred years old.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257323274_df1927d28d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You can walk normally here.

The second and most publicized attraction of Novosibirsk is Akademgorodok.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256575271_e99818501d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Academy Town did not impress me. It differs from the rest of Novosibirsk mainly in its cleanliness and number of trees.

Otherwise, Novosibirsk looks like this.

Very cool.

Opposite stands Lenin, by the way, an exact copy of the monument in <a href="../maidan">Kyiv</a>, which was demolished by the revolutionaries from the Maidan.
<p/>

This is not the main monument to Lenin in Novosibirsk. The main one is even more epic and stands opposite the opera house.

<p>
At the exit there is a map of the surrounding area. That’s already good, all that’s left is to take the last step and number the exits.

Residents of Siberia in everyday life call themselves Siberians (for comparison, residents of, say, the Vladimir region never identify themselves as “Vladimirians”).

There are even separatists who want to separate from their Muscovite oppressors.

<p>
There is a strange map hanging at the station, lost in time. Yes, the Yekaterinburg station is still called Sverdlovsk (and that’s what it says on tickets), but why Samara and not Kuibyshev? Petersburg, not St. Petersburg or Leningrad? And what is "Alma-Aty"?

There are several hostels in Novosibirsk, the prices are very low. The city is often visited by foreigners traveling along the Trans-Siberian Railway. My hostel had a rare working telephone.
