<h2>Macau</h2>
<p>
I imagined a dimly lit silent hall. All you can hear is the sound of chips hitting the table, the dealer’s announcements and short phrases like “fold”, “check”. Tense atmosphere. Someone is nervously smoking at the gambling table. But in real life everything is not like that. There is a huge hall with very bright lighting, loud music, very noisy. Large crowds gather around the tables, everyone is noisy. On the walls there are advertisements for a company that helps with gambling addiction. In a jacket and bow tie, I felt too respectable because besides me, only the guards were in suits.
99% of games are “heads and tails” varieties against the casino: roulette, blackjack, Caribbean poker, etc. With a probability of winning less than 0.5, of course.

Casinos in Macau are aimed at the Chinese, the explanations of the rules hanging at the tables are only in Chinese, and the games themselves are mostly Chinese. I barely managed to find a roulette in the far corner of Grand Lisboa. In the same Grand Lisboa, however, there are boards from which you can read the rules in English.

Macau is much smaller than Hong Kong. In fact, this territory consists of a small peninsula where the city center is located, and an island three times larger in area, partially filled, where new casinos, golf courses, etc. are being built. Older casinos such as the Grand Lisboa, once the largest in Macau, are located in the southern part of the city center. The Grand Lisboa skyscraper and the Macau TV tower are visible from many points in the center.

The first thing that catches your eye is the Portuguese yellow and black paving stones. As in <a href="../rio-de-janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>, other Brazilian cities and in Portugal itself.

<p>
Also here street signs are made in the style of tiles (azulejos), although in Portugal itself the signs are completely different.
<p/>

<p>
Some signs are on poles.

<p>
The central square is reminiscent of Brazilian cities, for example, <a href="../curitiba">Florianópolis</a>. Portuguese colonial style.
<p/>

<p>
The main street is packed with people.

Paving stones.

<p>
Portuguese is not compulsory in schools, almost no one speaks it, and trying to communicate with locals in Portuguese is even more useless than in English. However, the inscriptions are traditionally duplicated. Even signs describing attractions contain text in Portuguese.

<p>
There is also a monument to Camões, on which the first stanzas of the Lusiads are written.

The old center is ending very quickly, to the south of it are glass offices, hotels and casinos.
<p/>

<p>
To the north are residential areas.
<p/>

<p>
Residential areas in Macau are completely different from Portugal.
<p/>

<p>
Only occasionally something European.

<p>
For some reason, most houses look as if they had recently been on fire.
<p/>

<p>
Black walls.
<p/>

<p>
Dilapidated balconies.
<p/>

<p>
The buildings are very dense.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257437700_54324efaa6_o.jpg">
<p>
Many of the buildings are similar to Hong Kong apartment buildings.
<p/>

<p>
But in general, the number of floors is much lower than in Hong Kong.

On the other side of the bay is China, the city of Zhuhai.

A typical Chinese feature is small altars. This one stands in some narrow nook between the houses.
<p/>

<p>
Quite a mini-altar.

<p>
Portas do Cerco, border gate. Beyond them is the border with China. Inside, everything was perfected to the point of automaticity - the counters showed that by one o'clock in the afternoon more than 100 thousand people had crossed the border in both directions, however, the queues go quite quickly. On the Macau side it’s instant, on the Chinese side there are only two booths for foreigners, so it’s slower there.
