<h1>South Africa: Cape Town, Stellenbosch, Durban</h1>
<i>27-31 January 2024</i>
<h2>Cape Town</h2>
<p>
I started my journey to Africa from the most non-African part of it - Cape Town. This is the only corner of sub-Saharan Africa where there were few indigenous people, and white colonists were in the majority, as in Australia, the USA or Argentina. The key factor here was the climate - it is not tropical, but more like southern Europe. There is no malaria that prevented the colonization of tropical Africa until the end of the 19th century. The Portuguese, who initially explored the route to India around Africa, did not like these places because of the dangerous winds, and preferred to make bases further (where Angola and Mozambique are now), and the Dutch began to settle in the Cape Town area from the 17th century. After the Napoleonic Wars, the territory became a colony of England, but the locals already spoke their own language, which over 400 years of evolution diverged from Dutch, and is now called Afrikaans, and the inhabitants are Afrikaners, or Boers. From Cape Town, the Boers moved north overland, establishing new colonies on lands not subject to other European powers. This is how the Boer republics of Orange and Transvaal appeared, but after the Anglo-Boer War in 1902 they also came under British rule, forming the Union of South Africa that we have now.

Taking off from Johannesburg, the plane flew over green fields for a while, but as the Northern Cape approached, the landscape changed to a more desolate one.

Closer to Cape Town, small mountains begin.

Here you can see a rich country: big houses, good roads, like in America.

And this is a very poor country like Pakistan.

But this is the same Cape Town.

Before we figure out what's what, let's look at Cape Town from above.

Moreover, there is an excellent observation deck here - Table Mountain.

Cabin. On the right it says: Our African Wonder, this is not without reason. Table Mountain is one of the "Seven Wonders of Nature", and the last one I haven't been to. The rest: <a href="../amazonia">Amazonia</a>, <a href="../argentina">Iguazu Falls</a>, <a href="../hanoi">Halong Bay </a>, <a href="../cebu">Underground River</a>, <a href="../busan">Jeju Island</a>, <a href="../bali">Komodo Island</a>

The booth is made in a very unusual way: as it goes up, it rotates, so everyone can look in all directions.

The landscape and views reminded me very much of Mount Wellington in <a href="../melbourne">Tasmania</a>.

Let's get to know the layout of Cape Town. Behind Table Mountain (to the south) is the Cape Peninsula, at the end of which is the Cape of Good Hope, where I will go later.
<p/>

To the west of the mountain are the elite areas of Camps Bay, Clifton and Sea Point.

This is where the center of Cape Town stands.

<p>
Lion's head hill is visible on the left. In the distance to the right is the small island of Robben, on which there was a prison where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned. You can sail there, but ferries are quite rare, and you need to buy tickets well in advance.
<p/>

In Cape Town, hotels are noticeably more expensive than in other cities in South Africa. For $25 there was only one place in the center, generally not bad, but I had to go up the hill. But the view is epic.

As I understand it, this is a hostel for students that rents out individual rooms like a hotel. The common kitchen has a huge number of stoves, and instead of a refrigerator there is a whole refrigeration room with separate boxes.

On the same hill, a couple of hundred meters to the north, is the Bo Kaap area.
<p/>

This was originally an area where migrants from Malaysia lived, so the local colorful houses are reminiscent of the architecture of Southeast Asia.

The business center and the streets on the hill above it are considered fairly safe. There is some sidewalk trading there, but on the whole it is quite nice, and there are quite a few police.

The most luxurious area of ​​Cape Town is the Waterfront. White tourists usually walk there, and there is a complete feeling that this is some kind of rich English-speaking country.

Distance indicators. Cape Town is very far from everything. The closest place I've been before is Rio de Janeiro, which is 6,000 kilometers away (or maybe <a href="../paraty">Vitoria</a> is a little closer). In the other direction, the closest place is <a href="../riyadh">Jizan</a> in Saudi Arabia, also about 6000 kilometers away.

Let's look at a supermarket in South Africa. The most common chains here are Spar (as in Europe), Woolworths (as in Australia) and Pick'n'Pay (I haven't seen it on other continents, but this chain is also available in neighboring countries). Woolworths seemed too expensive to me, Pick'n'Pay was just right. Spar has a smaller assortment, but the prices there are quite normal. This is a Quick Spar in the center of Cape Town. Prices are in rands, 1 dollar = 19 rands.

The selection of fruits in South Africa is not very large and largely coincides with Europe. In general, it is better to buy fruits in markets or on the streets, they are cheaper. In the store, bananas cost more than a dollar.

<h2>Cape of Good Hope</h2>
<p>
Many people mistakenly think that the Cape of Good Hope is the southernmost point of Africa. Actually no, it's more of a southwestern point. But here is the watershed of the Atlantic and Indian oceans. The Portuguese named the cape that way because it gave them hope of opening a sea route to India, which happened at the end of the 15th century.

Next we went to Cape Point. It's just a few kilometers away. Looking at the map, I thought that the Point was the Cape of Good Hope, since it is more elongated and looks like a cape, rather than a protrusion. But the rock at the Cape of Good Hope is a little further south.

<h2>Simon's Town and Muizenberg</h2>
<p>
The town of Simon's Town is located on the east coast of the Cape Peninsula. Most people come here to see penguins.
<p/>

<p>
Little African penguins live here (this species is found only in this region; there are other penguins in Antarctica). Their numbers have been declining for a long time, and now Simon's Town has been made a reserve for them.

<h2>Stellenbosch</h2>
<p>
The town of Stellenbosch is located about 40 kilometers from Cape Town. It is known for its colonial architecture and wine production. But the most interesting and educational thing was how to get there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537522070_64569f627f_o.jpg" >
<p>
I naively plotted the route on moovit and google maps, which suggested taking a local train, even the schedule was indicated. But when I arrived at the Cape Town station, I learned that trains to Stellenbosch had not been running for a long time. There was also a bus station nearby, I went out to a huge field with minibuses, found out which one was going to Stellenbosch (it was written in small letters on the side below, and not on the windshield) and got in there. And then I waited for two hours until there were enough passengers for us to go. It was somehow strange for such a seemingly popular route (two large neighboring cities). Empty Stellenbosch railway station:
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53537521960_38b74b5334_o.jpg" >
<p>
After walking around the city, I returned to the Stellenbosch bus station to find a minibus back. There weren't any. They told me it might be in an hour or something. At the same time, there were a bunch of minibuses nearby that departed constantly. After Googling the names of their destinations, I realized what was going on. Some went to neighboring villages, and some of them went to Cape Town. But not to the city center where I came from. But to those areas with slums in the east that we passed on the highway. By the way, in Stellenbosch there are a lot of white people on the streets, but I didn’t notice a single one at the bus station. And that’s how I understood what apartheid was.

<h2>Durban</h2>
<p>
Durban is the third city of South Africa, located in the southeast on the coast of the Indian Ocean. The province is called KwaZulu-Natal, Natal is apparently a Portuguese colonial name (meaning "Christmas" in Portuguese) and KwaZulu is "Land of Zulu" in the Zulu language. South Africa has many official languages, and Zulu is the most common of them, quite a few people speak it as a second language. After the “white” Cape Town, where Afrikaans and English are spoken, Durban was for me the first city in the “other” half of South Africa.

Durban has better public transport than Cape Town. At least there was a minibus like this at the airport exit. It is interesting that it does not travel along a fixed route, but delivers all passengers to their addresses.

A lot of things are prohibited. By the way, Durban is called eThekwini in Zulu. The language is generally interesting, I studied it a little on Duolingo. I especially liked the clicking sounds that I was never able to pronounce properly (in writing they are designated by the letters x, q, c, hence the strange-looking combinations of consonants).
