<h1>China: Beijing</h1>

<h2>Beijing</h2>
<p>
In October 2008, I visited Asia for the first time - China. It was shortly after the 2008 Olympic Games, and I went to the World Mind Sport Games, which coincided with them. We lived in the Beijing Olympic Village, not far from the stadium.

China wasn't as high-tech then as it is now, but Beijing hasn't changed that much from 2008 to <a href="../tianjin">2014</a>. Only prices have increased significantly; in 2008 everything seemed ultra cheap to me (due to the exchange rate of the ruble, of course, too, but prices in yuan have also increased).

What I liked most back then was the Summer Palace and the park.

I went on an excursion to the Great Wall of China. This is the most popular site, Badaling.

At the most inopportune moment, the battery on the camera died.

Along the way we also stopped at the tombs of the Ming Dynasty - a UNESCO monument.
