<h1>India: Delhi, Amritsar, Dharamsala, Shimla, Chandigarh</h1>
<i>4-25 April 2017</i>
<h2>Delhi</h2>
<p>
Almost all trips to northern India begin in Delhi. This city has a bad reputation among tourists, and usually no one stays long here, but due to circumstances, I spent almost 10 days in Delhi, so I had my fill of the Indian capital. It is believed that there are a lot of crooks on the streets here, but I didn’t notice anything: no one came up to me and tried to take me to a store or a fake railway ticket office, and they asked for alms no more than in Paris or Los Angeles. This is a very big city, and no one here cares about you, except tourists from the outback, who may ask to take a photo with them near famous attractions.

All guidebooks tell a fairy tale that the taxi driver taking you from the airport will probably say that your hotel has burned down, or that the area where your hotel is is all closed due to a holiday or rally, and will take you to a hotel that pays him a commission. I can’t imagine how dumb you have to be to fall for such a stupid scam. Besides, why spend two hours vomiting in a taxi in traffic jams, if you can get to the center in 20 minutes on a nice metro train for less than a dollar? The metro takes you to the New Delhi railway station, from where the Main Bazaar street begins, where cheap hotels are concentrated. I expected it to be something like <a href="../bangkok">Khao San Road</a> and was immediately disappointed. Two-story gray houses, similar to Brazilian favelas, below are only shops with clothes and a couple of travel agencies with exchange offices. Not a single bar and only three or four restaurants on the entire street. Well, it's littered, of course. There are quite few foreign tourists in India, absolutely not comparable with Southeast Asia.
<p/>

<p>
There is only one corner, which in a photograph may look like Khao San with its shining signs.
<p/>

<p>
And then it is better to cut it from above, and not from below.
<p/>

<p>
Quite quickly I found a hotel room for 800 rupees ($13) with air conditioning, which, as it turned out later, is about the standard price for India. Without air conditioning it's half the price, but in summer Delhi is still a little hot (40 degrees, but with low humidity). Towards the end of the trip, when I was traveling alone, I got used to it and began to stay in rooms without air conditioning. The whole area around Main Bazaar is like that.
<p/>

After the rain there are dirty puddles on the roads.

<p>
From time to time there are closed residential complexes of buildings similar to Soviet commieblocks. By local standards, this is already cool housing, there is security at the entrance to the yard.
<p/>

<p>
A 15-minute walk south of Main Bazaar is the more or less decent Connaught Place area. On the map it looks like several concentric circles of streets, they are lined with colonial buildings, and it is more or less clean.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256252538_f889728d85_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I thought this was a place for wealthy people to shop, but in terms of the selection of stores and window displays, it looks more like the shopping arcades near the Vykhino metro station.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256800334_32af40ab33_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Only a corner of H&M is scrubbed to a shine (for those who don’t know, H&M is one of the cheapest clothing brands in European shopping centers).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256052056_64bf92e78e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In Delhi, I mostly ate at one place, Khosla, which was closest to my hotel. You can try almost all significant Indian dishes there. When I went to the outskirts of large shopping centers, I also went to Burger King - the most satisfying establishment in India.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255324012_e315157954_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Chicken tikka shish kebab. Cafe Khosla looks unpresentable (and by the standards of Russia, where everyone is obsessed with hygiene, this is probably a branch of hell), but it’s delicious and I didn’t have any problems.
<p/>

<p>
India is one of the few countries where I hesitate to drink tap water. But I didn’t reach the level of paranoia when you even brush your teeth with water from a bottle. I also didn’t develop the habit of wiping my hands with a wet napkin every 10 minutes, so I ended up getting poisoned twice in three months, but it’s not that bad. A bottle of water almost always costs 20 rupees (=$0.30), sometimes there are machines that pour water much cheaper, but it is warm.
<p/>

<p>
Quite often there are open toilets on the streets, this is terrible, because they are hellishly dirty and ugly.
<p/>

You can ride on a carriage to Main Bazaar, as VIPs used to ride, so as not to see the mob.

<p>
Previously, India was probably much cleaner, because there was no plastic waste, but now everyone, out of habit, throws these containers on the ground, but they do not disappear.

<p>
In a typical Indian park, as a matter of principle, there are no benches; everyone sits on the grass. At the same time, grass is planted very rarely, which is why the park is becoming bald.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256253738_24d73e3868_h.jpg"/>
<p>
New Delhi railway station. I had already been to the airport in the Belgian city <a href="../huy">Charleroi</a>, so the crowd of people sleeping on the floor did not shock me.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257097770_69a2595d33_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Behind the station, the old city of Delhi begins, but it differs little from the Main Bazaar area except that the streets are even more crowded.
<p/>

<p>
In Delhi, taxis are rickshaws (tuk-tuks) of the same colors as Moscow fences. Taxis don't just drive on the streets; you need to call them by phone or use Uber. Rickshaws cost 10-12 rupees per kilometer, but very rarely they agree to go by the meter.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256053226_6a37d868e6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The streets are divided according to the types of goods traded there. So I wandered into auto parts street.

Only sometimes, through the clouds of wires and signs, can one see that once upon a time they built well here too.

<p>
In India there are many outdated phenomena and technologies that have not been seen in Europe and Russia for 50 years. For example, I saw such an iron only in museums of everyday life of the 19th century.

In Delhi, I repaired my camera, once again making sure that India is no longer the cheap country it was 20 years ago. Repairs here cost about the same as in China and Thailand.

Delhi is a city consisting of many different districts, there is no clear center and outskirts, and the sights of different eras are scattered over a large area. There are three World Heritage Sites in Delhi.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255323272_665a44deb5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The oldest of them, and the farthest from the center, is the Qutub Minar (12-14th century).

There is also an iron column on the territory that has not rusted in 2000 years, and no one knows exactly why.

But I did go to the lesser known Old Fort (Purana Qila) south of the old city.

On the last day before my flight, I was in Delhi again, I decided to go to a castle that I had never been to before - Feroz Shah Kotla, a 14th century castle.

<p>
At the top of the ruins stands the pillar of Ashoka. Such pillars were erected throughout India in the 3rd century BC, during the reign of Ashoka, when India reached its largest size in history (it did not include the current southernmost provinces, but did include modern Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257483179_6dadb2997d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
To this day, 20 such pillars have survived, mainly in the northern part of India, and the laws of the empire were written on them.

There, next door, you can visit Raj Ghat - the grave (more precisely, the cremation site) of Gandhi.

Among the modern buildings, one can highlight the Baha'i temple in the shape of a lotus.

From the very beginning, I was trying to understand, where are the good areas in Delhi where the middle class hang out? Under the British, the "good" area was New Delhi, where the government is now located. Everything there is done monumentally, with giant avenues. It’s about three kilometers from the presidential palace to the gate, and along the road there is only a lawn.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255322947_c67c42f1b1_h.jpg"/>

<p>
There is pandemonium at the gate.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256052381_8f27f45263_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Walking around New Delhi, you understand that it is not the middle class that lives here, but the upper class. All high and solid fences, nothing more.

There is nothing special to catch in the center of Delhi; at most there are five to seven-story government buildings.

In search of civilization, I went to the city of Noida - a new area of Delhi that has been built from scratch since the 1970s. Formally, this is not Delhi, but a neighboring state, but the metro goes there.
<p/>

McDonald's is a family restaurant. It’s interesting that beggars hang out there, that is, by local standards, this establishment is not for the poor (it’s clear that beggars are not counting on tourists; there are no attractions in Noida).

There are also a couple of more modern shopping centers here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256052506_25e20e8494_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Inside there is a food court and a Big Bazaar grocery supermarket - essentially the only more or less large chain in India. The assortment is pathetic; any Magnit in a Russian provincial town will have a larger selection.

Continuing my search, I reached a suburb from the opposite end - the city of Gurgaon, Haryana.
<p/>

You can get here on the yellow metro line, and there is also its own line, which was built even before the metro from the center of Delhi reached here.

I was not allowed into the shopping center because I had a camera with me. They didn’t forbid taking photographs, they simply didn’t even let us into the territory. The level of security paranoia in India is very high.

Let's look at the residential areas of Gurgaon. This is average housing.

The courtyards are clean, but outside the gates it’s not so good. But it’s not as dirty as in the historical center, yet there is less density here, few people walk the streets, and there is almost no trade in residential areas.

There are about 10 other large shopping centers scattered around the city. Here is the Pacific Mall, I stopped by there before my flight. It's closer to the center than Gurgaon, which is probably why it's so crowded.

<p>
But in a city the size of Moscow there are only 10 shopping centers! In Russia, almost every metro station has two. And in India, apart from these shopping centers, even grocery stores familiar to us are practically absent, everything is only in markets.

India still has 15 years to go to reach the 2005 level of China or Russia. But over the past 15 years, progress has still been considerable. For example, the Delhi metro opened only in 2002, but now it is already very solid, 8 lines and more than 200 stations.

<h2>Amritsar</h2>
<p>
Amritsar is the main city of Indian Sikhs. Let's get a little education on the topic. Indians are citizens of India (of any religion and nationality). Hindus are followers of the Hindu religion. Sikhs are followers of the Sikhism religion; this relatively little-known religion appeared about 500 years ago in these lands. The stereotypical appearance of an Indian with a thick beard and a turban is based primarily on the Sikhs, because not shaving is one of their main traditions. Sikhs also do not eat meat out of principle. Ultra-budget travelers love and respect the Sikhs for another unusual tradition - organizing free lunches for everyone every day in the temple (gurudwara).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256560559_1f0b0ceeaf_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Sikhism is a monotheistic religion; we can say that it appeared in opposition to Islam, which was then dominant among the rulers. Thanks to the unity of the Sikh community, they were able to successfully resist the Mughal Empire, and in the 18th century achieved independence, which lasted until the capture of India by the British. During the partition of India, half of the state of Punjab, where there were more Muslims, went to Pakistan, while the Sikhs were harshly expelled from there. It was an incredibly cruel time: immediately after the British left and the independence of India and Pakistan was declared, tens of millions of people were expelled and hundreds of thousands, if not millions, were killed because they had the “wrong” religion. In Indian Punjab, Sikhs now form the majority, and in the 1980s they even seriously fought for independence, which is why the Indian army stormed the Golden Temple in Amritsar in 1984; in retaliation the Sikhs killed Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Now anyone can enter the Golden Temple; inside there are dazzling white floors and walls, which are even pleasant to walk on without shoes.

<p>
The area around the Golden Temple is the cleanest and most comfortable place in all of India. There is no garbage, the streets are neatly paved with tiles, all vehicles are prohibited, there are no wires, the buildings are restored and not hung with signs, there are mainly souvenir shops there.

Another positive change in Amritsar is that a couple of years ago they opened a museum in the local old fort. Before this, there was a military base here, as in a huge number of other historical fortresses in India. It would seem that stone walls no longer have such strategic importance, but nevertheless.

The border with Pakistan lies very close to Amritsar. Between Amritsar and Lahore there is virtually the only functioning border checkpoint across this border by land. It will be funny if I ever happen to be in the same place on the other side - going to Pakistan is, in principle, quite possible.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256014623_3a5c31a2df_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Every day after the border is closed, the military puts on a patriotic show. Indians and Pakistanis strive to surpass each other in terms of pathos. To do this, the soldiers put on strange headdresses that look like combs and march at the gate. The Pakistanis have a similar uniform, but it is black instead of red.

What was happening on the Pakistani side was not very clear from my non-VIP seats. The Pakistani side is undoubtedly better for observation, since there are 10 times fewer spectators there, and the stands are closer to the scene.

Many people travel from here further north to Kashmir, but the prospect of spending a couple of days on a bus on bad roads outweighed me, so I passed by this disputed state for now. In Dharamsala, I settled near the bus station where I arrived, but it turned out that all the tourists live in the upper part of the city, where tourist buses from Delhi and other popular cities arrive directly.
<p/>

The Dalai Lama lives in Dharamsala. He was expelled from Tibet after the establishment of Chinese communist rule there. A significant part of the city's population are refugees from Tibet, and there are Buddhist temples here.

<h2>Shimla</h2>
<p>
Shimla is the capital of Himachal Pradesh and one of the most beautiful cities in India. For some reason, it is completely overlooked by the hundreds of backpackers who hang out in Dharamsala and Manali, although Shimla is quite conveniently located and easy to get to. It was in this city that I first learned about the problems with hotels in India - I had to look for a hotel for two hours, walking up and down the hills, and everywhere they simply refused to accommodate me, including all the supposedly cheap places indicated in old guidebooks. As a result, I had to pay more than 1000 rupees for the room.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254771212_2b806cc757_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Shimla was the "summer" capital of British India, apparently due to its cool climate.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255706153_318e54814e_h.jpg"/>

It's funny that the Indians extended their rules about the prohibition of wearing shoes in the temple to Christian churches. The ban is quite practical - the streets of India are too dirty, although in Shimla the level of cleanliness is acceptable. By the way, this is what the school uniform looks like in this city.

<h2>Shimla-Kalka</h2>
<p>
The railway between Shimla and Kalka is listed as a World Heritage Site along with the more famous mountain road to the city of Darjeeling. On this route there are special trains with small carriages and only seats, and tickets are not sold on the Internet - you have to go to the station to buy, however, I bought it without any problems, only the queue, as always in India, moves very slowly.

<h2>Chandigarh</h2>
<p>
Chandigarh is an unusual Indian city. It was built from scratch in the 1950s according to a plan, and was originally built as the capital for the state of Punjab (instead of Lahore, which went to Pakistan). After the separation of the new state of Haryana from the eastern part of Punjab, Chandigarh became the capital of these two states at once, and the city itself was allocated to a separate "union territory" (like Delhi). Of all the regions in India, it has the highest GDP per capita, more than Delhi.
<p/>

<p>
Chandigarh was built according to the design of the well-known French architect Le Corbusier, the one who once came up with the prototype of the concept of the commieblock and built the first examples <a href="../nice">in France</a>. It is not surprising that Chandigarh is very similar to a typical Soviet city with very wide streets and neighborhood development. From a typical street in Chandigarh, you can't see the buildings behind the trees.
<p/>

<p>
The city is divided into more than 50 squares, numbered from the northern edge. In square 1 is the Capitol, the closer to it, the more elite. Almost all the squares are fenced around the perimeter, and you can only enter in a few places.

In the 40 square there are several typical Indian market areas, a labyrinth of narrow streets, and inexpensive hotels can be found there.

There are two buildings in the Capitol that Le Corbusier personally designed: the government house and the court, but you can’t even get close to them, all approaches are blocked a kilometer away. This is the court.

The only area accessible to tourists is around the Open Hand Monument (also the work of Le Corbusier). Oddly enough, it’s not even forbidden to take photographs around it, although it’s not allowed on the road.

Since most of the paths are not used by anyone, they gradually fall into disrepair.

I can safely add the Rock Garden in Chandigarh to the collection of strange and unusual parks with sculptures. Its creator, Nek Chand, made it in secret for almost 20 years in a patch of forest in the very center of Chandigarh - between the lake and the Capitol. Apparently, then the level of paranoia and the number of police on the streets of India was noticeably less, so he was not noticed near the most guarded facility. When the garden was discovered, they decided not to demolish it, but to make it open to everyone; now it is one of the main attractions of the city.
<p/>
