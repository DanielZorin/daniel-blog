<h1>Canada: Ottawa, Toronto, Niagara Falls</h1>
<i>23-26 May 2018</i>
<h2>Ottawa</h2>
<p>
The history of Ottawa becoming the capital is easy to guess: they did not want to give victory to any of the largest cities (and in Canada they also speak different languages), and made a Solomon decision - to move the capital to a small city located exactly on the border of English- and French-speaking lands , with a mixed population. So Ottawa became the capital immediately after the unification of Ontario and Quebec into one country.

It's time to look at the grocery supermarket in Canada. This is a store of a large Metro chain in the heart of Ottawa. It must be said that in Canada it is much easier to find a supermarket than in large US cities. In Ottawa alone, which is not that big, there are 17 stores of the Metro chain alone.
Prices are in Canadian dollars (approximately 0.75 US dollars). It’s interesting that here on the price tag they write the price both per kilogram (as in Europe) and per pound (as in America). Tomatoes are not particularly cheap, although May is not the season yet.

<h2>Toronto</h2>
<p>
Toronto is the largest city in Canada. Unlike Montreal, there is no French language restriction, so migrants mostly settle here (or in Vancouver). At first glance it is a typical American square city with skyscrapers, but on the other hand there is a fairly compact center by the lake and a large tram network.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255847818_3d995af05c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are only two metro lines, one goes from west to east, and the second makes a loop, passing along the perimeter of the city center.

I lived in a remote residential area, in one of the houses in the photo (via airbnb). The nearest metro station was a 30-minute walk, or 5 minutes by bus, which ran every 15 minutes until late in the evening. Since transfers are free, I always took the bus.

<p>
This is what the area looks like. Interestingly, if you pay cash for the bus, the transfer is also free - you are given a paper ticket, torn at the current time, and it is valid for several hours. In that area, the transfer from bus to metro was without turnstiles at all, because the bus terminus was adjacent to the metro station, and everything there was organized with a through passage.

Next to my house there was also this high-rise building - local social housing.

Toronto's main attraction is C.N. Tower, the tallest structure in the world from 1975 to 2007.
<p/>

The tallest structure and the tallest building should not be confused (as Taipei 101 and the Petronas Towers were at one time) - buildings must have successive habitable floors. Since 2007, the tallest building has also become the tallest structure - the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.

Casa Loma is a Gothic castle built by a local millionaire. While the castle was being built, the millionaire managed to go broke, and eventually sold it; at first they made a hotel there, but later the government bought it and since then it has been a museum.

It is very beautiful in Toronto in the evening when the lights are on. They don’t skimp on it in the center, so it looks like New York, and not like in most American cities, where the streets are empty and dim in the evening.

<h2>Niagara Falls</h2>
<p>
Canada's top attraction by far is Niagara Falls. There are several of them nearby, but the main one is a powerful waterfall in the shape of a horseshoe. The Niagara River borders Canada and the United States. The opposite shore is in the States, but the visibility from it is worse, because it is slightly beyond the line of the waterfall. Since most tourists who can get here do not worry about visa issues, Canadians earn much more from the spectacle, and only Russian tourists often look with sadness only from the shore where it is easier to get a visa (not the one on which I am standing at this moment) .
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255835877_12e6b66991_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The horseshoe seems to be turned with its inner side towards Canada, so this embankment has the best view of it.

If you go further, you can stand just behind the waterfall.

Unlike <a href="../belo-horizonte">Iguazu</a>, visiting the waterfall here is free, because it is actually in the city. But to generate income, countless entertainment facilities have been built here. Starting from the zipline.

Here you can cross the border. According to North American tradition, there is no passport control at the exit, only at the entrance on the other side of the bridge. At the same time, exit from Canada to the USA is paid, it costs 1 dollar, which you need to throw into the turnstile in the form of four coins of 25 cents, and both Canadian and American ones are suitable (but Canadian ones are better, they are cheaper now). Exit from the USA is free.
