<h1>Brazil: São Paulo</h1>
<i>13-16 September 2024</i>
<h2>São Paulo</h2>
<p>
When I was passing through Brazil, I of course wanted to stay there for a couple of days to eat meat and acai, to rest after a long flight. Though, since I had three suitcases and two backpacks, it was inconvenient to travel, and I did not go to Rio de Janeiro, although it was so close. But I also really love São Paulo, and there are many nice things there too.

<p>
This time I splurged and stayed in the Paulista district. Well, in fact, it is not that expensive there either, in Brazil the prices are affordable. A hotel in Antalya is much more expensive.

Previously, on the contrary, I often walked in the northern half.

They used to charge by weight, but now you get unlimited food for 80 reals ($16). Though, it depends on the branch, each branch has its own rates, somewhere they still charge by weight.

There are few exchange offices in Brazil, and the rate in them is bad, so I decided to try to get by with only cashless payments for three days. In general, it was a success, the only place where there was a slight difficulty was the metro. At the ticket office, tickets are sold only for cash (by the way, it still costs 5 reals, as in 2021), and the machines did not accept my cards. But I managed to register in the application and buy an electronic ticket with a QR code there, although I was lucky here that I have had a Brazilian tax number (CPF) since 2021, without it I would not have registered.

Of the new places for me in São Paulo, I visited the zoo and the botanical garden. They are located in a park area near the source of the Ipiranga River.
