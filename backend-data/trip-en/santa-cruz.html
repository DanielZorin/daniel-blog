<h1>Bolivia: Santa Cruz, Sucre, Potosi, Uyuni, Oruro</h1>
<i>27 March - 5 April 2021</i>
<h2>Santa Cruz de la Sierra</h2>
<p>
Bolivia, my first country after coronavirus! Usually all tourists come here by land from Peru or Chile, but since the land borders were closed, I arrived by plane, which is clearly rare for this country - there are few flights to Bolivia, and all of them are extremely expensive, except for the flight from Sao Paulo for ~$200. Interestingly, international flights do not fly to the capital La Paz, but to the second largest and richest city of Santa Cruz. Santa Cruz is located in the east of the country on a lowland that turns into the Amazon jungle and Pantanal swamps further towards the border with Brazil. This city has grown dramatically over the past 30 years; before that it was a regional center on the edge of the country. There are not many historical monuments in Santa Cruz, but it is the only city in Bolivia where there is a Starbucks, and not even one.

The landscapes around Santa Cruz are flat.

City center at night. From above, Santa Cruz looks a little like Moscow, since it also has many concentric rings, although the inside is built in an even grid, as is customary in the Americas.

<p>
After Brazil, Bolivia looked encouraging. Firstly, there was no lockdown, no measures at all other than wearing masks. Secondly, it is safer here, and people are not afraid to be outside at night. In Brazil, it is better not to show up in the city center at night.

In Bolivia on Easter they wear crosses like these, made from some kind of plant.
<p/>

Buses in Santa Cruz have numbers, there is even an application for plotting routes (Google maps does not have them), but it is super inconvenient.

There are also collective taxis - “trufi”. For example, they drive along rings.

<p>
Bolivian food is not the most dietary - they really like French fries and fried meat. Dish "salchipapa" - potatoes with sausages.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255644783_24c867b35a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In Bolivia, food in stores is quite expensive (more expensive than in Brazil), since almost everything is imported. Water is also expensive, the cheapest option is to buy it in bags for 1 Boliviano. They say 500 ml, but when pouring two packets into a liter bottle it usually turned out to be less.

One day I went to the neighboring town of Cotoca, where there is a big market on weekends.

At first I thought they were selling soup, but in fact these are local drinks “somo” and “chicha” - weak corn-based alcohol, like kvass.

In Bolivia, it is customary to bless new cars by covering them with flowers, just like in India.
<p/>

<p>
I found coca leaves at the market. In Bolivia and Peru they are chewed instead of cigarettes. Areca and betel are consumed similarly in Southeast Asia. They taste and feel quite similar. Cocaine is synthesized from coca leaves, but the concentration is of a different order - one gram of cocaine requires a huge bag of leaves.

<h2>Sucre</h2>
<p>
I was sure that the capital of Bolivia is La Paz, but it turns out that the official capital is Sucre. This is written in the constitution, although in fact the government and the president are in La Paz (and this is, normally, the definition of the capital), and only the constitutional court was left in Sucre.

A crowd of people walked towards the center in the morning; at first I thought it was some kind of religious procession.

But when they started singing “El pueblo unido jamas sera vencido,” it became clear that this was a protest.

In 2019, a revolution occurred in Bolivia; socialist President Evo Morales, who tried to rig the elections, fled the country. The appointment of new elections dragged on, then was postponed due to the coronavirus; as a result, in the fall of 2020, a supporter of Morales won the new elections, and the exile triumphantly returned to his homeland.

Historically, Sucre was a wealthy city, home to an elite who owned mines in nearby Potosi. The altitude of Sucre is only 2800 meters, much lower than most Bolivian cities, so it is more comfortable here.

<h2>Potosi</h2>
<p>
The city of Potosi (Villa Real de Potosi), like Sucre, is listed as a World Heritage Site. This is a silver mining center, which makes it similar to the Mexican city <a href="../guadalajara">Guanajuato</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257706035_aaf6fd3618_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Potosi is located on the side of a mountain at altitudes from 3900 to 4100 meters, and after arriving there I was overcome by mountain sickness - breathing problems due to low air density, leading to a lack of oxygen in the blood. I have never had this disease before, because the maximum altitude where I went was about 3200 meters (in <a href="../nepal">Nepal</a> and in <a href="../yunnan">China</a>). A couple of times I was around 3500 (<a href="../vladikavkaz">Elbrus</a> and <a href="../tenerife">Teide</a>), but for a very short time. The first day in Potosí I had a severe headache and was out of breath from climbing one floor of stairs. Coca leaves and Sorojchi Pills, which are sold in pharmacies for 5 bolivianos, helped
<p/>

<p>
The center of Potosi consists of two-story buildings with wooden balconies. It really looks like the Canary Islands or some cities in Mexico.

<h2>Uyuni</h2>
<p>
Uyuni is a small tourist town where people come to see the salt flat of the same name. This city seemed very interesting and atmospheric to me, a kind of stronghold of civilization in the middle of the desert, far from everything, with dusty roads and strange monuments. It reminded me of small towns in the western part of the USA, only it is not half-abandoned and dead, like its American counterparts, but very lively.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255677731_e58e9f882a_h.jpg"/>

<p>
The city is really very dusty, probably because it is desert and dry, and many of the roads are dirt.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255880868_decb4a36df_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Initially, Uyuni appeared as a railway junction - trains ran from here towards Argentina and Chile and exported minerals. The station is in the city center.
<p/>

<h2>Salar de Uyuni</h2>
<p>
The main attraction of Bolivia, for which people usually come here, is the Uyuni salt flat. Many people combine it with the Atacama Desert in Chile, but in 2021 this route was impossible due to closed borders. In general, there were few tourists, I was still on a day off, so there were Bolivians from other cities, of whom our entire group actually consisted. An excursion to the Uyuni salt flat costs 200 bolivianos (about $30), tourists are taken there in jeeps, since you actually need to drive along the salt flat, and not on a road.
<p/>

The village closest to the salt flat is called Colchani. There is a regular road leading to it, along which you can meet llamas.

Why an island? Since the salt marsh is a dry sea, the rock in it turns out to be an island.

Only cacti can grow when there is only salt around.

By the way, my skin didn’t handle the salt marsh very well, especially my lips.

It’s better, of course, when the clouds are more curly.

<h2>Oruro</h2>
<p>
In every country I try to visit a large and non-tourist city. In Bolivia, the largest such cities are Oruro and Cochabamba. Oruro is right on the way from Uyuni to La Paz.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255868802_eb834b6c2f_h.jpg"/>

<p>
On the way from Uyuni to Oruro, the bus stopped at the exit from the town of Challapata.
<p/>

<p>
Further the road was blocked by an empty bus and police. I asked what happened, the police told me that the road was blocked because of the university, and they expected release at 6 o’clock (at that moment it was about 3). I thought I had misunderstood something, maybe in Spanish “rockfall” or “mudflow” sounds similar to “university”.
<p/>

<p>
After waiting a little, I got into a taxi, whose driver promised to avoid the traffic jam on country roads. In fact, he drove around the police post along the dirt road, and then pulled out onto the main road, along which stones were chaotically scattered (but it didn’t look like a landslide, because the road went through a plain).
<p/>

<p>
After a few kilometers we arrived at a blocked bridge, and it turned out that it was blocked by two cars with flags. It really turned out to be a protest because the university had some dispute with the government! In Russia or in the USA, the police would disperse such a protest in 5 minutes, and the participants would be jailed under criminal charges, but in Bolivia, it seems there is not even a fine for doing this, the police themselves protect them.

Oruro is the fourth largest city in Bolivia (fifth if you count La Paz and El Alto separately). A huge new bus station was built in the outskirts, but there are few normal hotels there, so I settled near the old station, where you can still catch a minibus to La Paz.

Near the hotel there was an excellent grill for a ridiculous price - 25-30 Bolivianos ($3-4). They bring the entire grill and place it next to the table, and excellent snacks are placed on the table.
