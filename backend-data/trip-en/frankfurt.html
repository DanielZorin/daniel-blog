<h1>Germany: Frankfurt, Wiesbaden</h1>
<i>2 October 2012</i>
<h2>Frankfurt</h2>
<p>
I can’t say that I love Germany very much, although I have been there three times. Germany is not a place where it’s interesting to walk around the city in the evening; you won’t find cozy courtyards or romantic bridges. The beauty here is cold, truly Nordic. Probably, many people associate German architecture with castles like Neuschwanstein, but when I hear Germany, the first association is something like this landscape, typical primarily for large cities.

What do we see here? The main color scheme is gray-brown, no variegation. Houses that vaguely resemble old ones stand side by side with cubic concrete structures. Minimum advertising posters. Trees are planted evenly on the sidewalk, and the tree is surrounded on all sides by the road surface as much as possible. There are relatively few passers-by because it is daytime and everyone is at work. A canopy over the sidewalk is a very convenient and common thing in Germany, which saved me from the rain several times. Parked bicycles. Finally, the most important detail by which you can unmistakably recognize a German city is the neat flat tiles on the sidewalk in the form of large rectangles or gray squares, not like the poorly fitted Moscow ones.

Sometimes something unusual will stick between the skyscrapers.

In the very center there is a beautiful square, around which life is in full swing, and in some places there are houses with paintings.

And here is the other side of the central square.

In some places, street names are made of individual metal letters.

The original idea is to make the red man twice as big to focus attention on him.

It turned out that the building of the European Central Bank, which is always shown in the news about the imminent collapse of the eurozone, is located in Frankfurt. The euro really doesn’t hold up well, it needs to be tied up with emergency tape.

Directly below the euro is the headquarters of local revolutionaries. The police don't advertise to them by ignoring them.

What is truly beautiful in Germany and done with the utmost care is transport. It’s worth dwelling on it in more detail, but some other time. For now, it is worth noting that Hauptbahnhof is located in the very center of each city.

Getting lost in Germany is simply unrealistic. All you have to do is leave the station and walk straight ahead, and you will definitely come across a map.

<h2>Wiesbaden</h2>
<p>
Wiesbaden is more beautiful than Frankfurt.

In general, in Germany, the smaller the city, the more pleasant it is.

In small towns they are not lazy about designing signs.

9 am, even in the square in front of the casino there is no one.

It's really cold in early October, so a hot spring fountain is very welcome.

Attached to the street name sign is an explanation of the name. I have already seen this (for example, in Veliky Novgorod), but not in Germany.

In Wiesbaden there are ultra-modern pay phones with Internet access. In this form, this thing may even be useful in the modern world.

In conclusion, I would like to note that in Germany, more than anywhere else, they love to exhibit contemporary abstract art on the streets.
