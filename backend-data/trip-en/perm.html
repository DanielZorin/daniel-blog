<h1>Russia: Perm, Kungur</h1>
<i>30 May - 2 June 2012</i>
<h2>Kungur</h2>
<p>
Most tourists come here to see the caves. I'll leave them out of the picture, especially since I didn't take any photos inside. The city deserves a visit not only because of the cave.
<p/>

<p>
Kungur is the oldest city in the Perm region, located in a rather picturesque place, so the views of the opposite bank of the river are idyllic.

<p>
Outside the historical center, Kungur, like many other cities in Russia, resembles the countryside.

<p>
Goats graze right on the street.

<p>
Unfortunately, the center is not very well looked after.
<p/>

<p>
There are two notable churches in Kungur. One is located next to the prison right in the middle of the city.

<p>
At another I saw mirrored domes for the first time.

<p>
You can also see a supermarket here.
<p/>

<p>
And bus stops are proudly called “bus stops.”
<p/>

<p>
On the two main squares, the historical one and the station square, there are monuments to You-Know-Who (no, not Putin). You can play “find ten differences”.

<p>
It took me two hours to get to Kungur on a minibus filled with passengers, sitting in the back row, in constant shaking on not the best road, in the heat, with the windows closed, and with a powerful aroma of diesel fuel in the cabin. I got back in the same two hours by train, in which 90% of the seats were free and it was possible to sit comfortably on the seats. It’s paradoxical, but true: a ticket for a minibus costs 180 rubles, and a ticket for the train costs 120.
<p/>
<h2>Perm</h2>
<p>
What do we know about Perm? 20 hours by train to Moscow, one of the stops of the Trans-Siberian Railway, some kind of military industry, because of which the city was previously semi-closed, wide avenues, huge houses to accommodate almost a million residents, long distances. Everything changes when <i>they</i> arrive.
<p/>

<p>
The designers have already immortalized themselves on the wall of the Museum of Modern Art. <i>There was a big project to make Perm the Russian capital of modern art back in those years, famous designers took part in it.</i>
<p/>

<p>
Besides the monuments, two innovations are visually most noticeable. Firstly, this is a good project to colorize the typical dull fences with pyramidal spikes.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257378659_d0da148d8a_o.jpg">
<p>
Secondly, the bright, bold design of bus stops.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256833168_a40d2384f3_o.jpg">
<p>
It is worth talking about public transport in detail. It is represented by buses, trolleybuses, and in some places trams. Most of the buses were written off here from Germany, and the inscriptions in German were not even removed.
<p/>

<p>
There are also new orange buses. Despite the introduction of new stops, using the bus system is still difficult, although it is immeasurably more convenient than in Moscow. It’s good that at the stops, as a rule, the names of all stops on the route of each of the buses passing there are written down, and not just the start and end. At a minimum, if you need to go without a transfer and the toponymy of the city is familiar, you can figure it out. In case you have to travel far (and in Perm you will most likely have to travel from one end to the other with a transfer in the center), you need a map, but, alas, it is no good, because the numbers indicating bus numbers are too rare , and as a result it is impossible to accurately trace the entire path along it. What makes the situation worse is that buses from A to B and from B to A have the same numbers, but can travel along different streets and different stops. Based on this sign, I didn’t immediately understand that bus 13 would take me in the opposite direction to the right direction, although I seemed to be standing on the right side of the road.

<p>
Additionally, cutting-edge design faces harsh realities.
<p/>

<p>
Another innovation is infrastructure for cyclists. Bike paths have been drawn.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257674605_3b1c384885_o.jpg">
<p>
And there are bicycle parking facilities. There are, however, few cyclists. There are no traffic jams on the outskirts, and there are no bike paths in the center.

<p>
The city's political spectrum does not yet include the "creative class". <i>It says: "Those who are content vote for United Russia (pro-Putin party), those who are not content vote for Liberal Democratic Party (the party with far right rhetoric, but in reality also pro-Putin)"</i>
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256833478_986f715b5a_o.jpg">
<p>
Although there is no shortage of creativity here.

There are a fair number of old buildings left in the city center.

I arrived just in time for the start of the White Nights in Perm festival. For this occasion, a stage in the shape of the letter P was erected.
