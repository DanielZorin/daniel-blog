<h1>Germany: Nuremberg, Bamberg, Weimar, Erfurt</h1>
<i>2-3 July 2023</i>
<h2>Nuremberg</h2>
<p>
How to get from Italy to Turkey? Italians do not need to go to Turkish resorts, they have their own. Therefore, there is not a single flight to Antalya from Italy, only to Istanbul at outrageous prices. Therefore, you need to fly to Germany with Ryanair, and from there there are already a bunch of flights to Turkish resorts. And it also worked out great that I connected flights from cities in that part of Germany where I had never been before. That's how I ended up in Nuremberg. Nuremberg is located in the northern part of Bavaria, which historically was a separate country called Franconia.

<h2>Erfurt</h2>
<p>
Erfurt is the capital of the state of Thuringia. This region was part of East Germany, which I know much worse than the western part (I've been only to Dresden as a child and to Berlin and its surroundings).
<p/>

<p>
Erfurt is not the most famous city in Germany, but it is approximately in the middle, and the main lines of high-speed trains cross here, so the local station is the main interchange hub.
<p/>

<p>
During the Napoleonic Wars, Erfurt was annexed directly to France. In 1808, Napoleon met with Alexander I here, and at the same time Napoleon and the poet Johann Goethe met. Napoleon's base was the Petersberg fortress.

From the inside it looks like an ordinary street with dense buildings, and you wouldn’t understand that this is a bridge.

In general, I expected that there would be a lot of commieblocks here, like in East Berlin, but this city is just as beautiful as Western German cities.

I departed from the local airport. This is a very small airport with 1-2 flights per day, mainly to resorts like Antalya. Corendon Airlines charged me 10 euros for checking in at the airport, even though online check-in for this airport was not available to begin with.
