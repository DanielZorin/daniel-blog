<h1>Poland: Warsaw</h1>

<h2>Warsaw</h2>
<p>
I suddenly found myself in Warsaw. My route was actually like this: San Francisco - Reykjavik - Amsterdam with one WOW Air ticket, then the next day Eindhoven - Vilnius with a low-cost airline. But the flight from San Francisco was delayed for three hours, the connection in Reykjavik was missed, and it turned out that the gap of almost a whole day to the Netherlands was not enough: the next flight from Reykjavik to Amsterdam was only the next morning, and I did not have time to catch the flight to Vilnius. The World Cup started in two days, and a ticket from Amsterdam to Moscow cost 400 euros - almost twice as much as my entire route from San Francisco. Yes, according to EU laws, I could receive compensation of as much as 600 euros for the delay of such a long flight, but I still need to get it, it’s problematic without an intermediary. Therefore, a free hotel in Iceland did not suit me at all; I had to get out of there. I was thinking of buying at my own expense a ticket for an overnight flight directly to Vilnius for 150 euros, I randomly asked if they could pay for this flight instead of a hotel + flight to Amsterdam, Instead I was offered to fly on WOW Air to Warsaw, fortunately the flight departed there literally in half an hour. After thinking for a minute, I agreed, because a bird in the hand is better: I ended up in Vilnius on time, and the additional costs were only about 20 euros for a Warsaw-Vilnius bus ticket + 1 euro for a trip from Warsaw airport to the center by train. And here I am in Warsaw.

The wait for the bus was about three hours, but because of the terrible pain in my leg, all I could do was go out to the square near the station to the Palace of Science and Culture. In better times, I would, of course, go to the old town.

So this time Poland for me was only in the Biedronka store at the station.
