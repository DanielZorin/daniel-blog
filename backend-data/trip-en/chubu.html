<h1>Japan: Fuji Kawaguchiko, Kofu, Shiojiri, Matsumoto, Tsumago, Magome, Nagoya, Inuyama, Hikone</h1>
<i>3-5 December 2017</i>
<h2>Fuji</h2>
<p>
Mount Fuji is a symbol of Japan. It is located not far from Tokyo, but it is quite rare to see the peak even from a close distance due to clouds and fog. Winter is the best time for this, and I was incredibly lucky: that day there was not a cloud in the sky, Fuji was visible even from the center of Tokyo, and I drove even closer - to Lake Kawaguchi on the northern slopes.

<p>
The easiest and fastest way to get to the city of Fuji-Kawaguchiko is by direct bus from Tokyo, although there is also a railway.
<p/>

The town is small.

<p>
There is a small hill where the funicular goes, but it’s not difficult to climb on foot in about 30 minutes.
<p/>

Here I am at the top. A little lower are people who came mainly from the funicular.

<h2>Kofu</h2>
<p>
From Lake Kawaguchi I took a bus to the nearest train station on a major line - Kofu. The station is in this shopping center.

Buses in Japan have an interesting payment system. When entering, you need to take a piece of paper on which the number of the current stop is printed. When exiting, you need to pay the driver; the price, depending on the number on the piece of paper, is indicated on the board above.

A stone's throw from the station there are the remains of Kofu Castle.

<p>
Karaoke. There are a lot of such establishments in Japan. Unlike Russia, where karaoke is just a restaurant where someone can sing in front of everyone, in Japan there are private rooms with good walls for rent. Half an hour here costs 180 yen during the day or 350 yen in the evening (the top price is a discount for schoolchildren). You can also take unlimited (bottom line) - 800 yen during the day until 8 pm, or 1680 yen per night. In principle, it is quite possible to spend the night there if you wish.
<p/>

<h2>Shiojiri</h2>
<p>
A short transfer in the city of Shiojiri. It is interesting only because of its name, which means “salt ass”. Frankly.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256252769_3f2af0fb5f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Small towns in Japan literally die out in the evening; for 30-40 minutes I did not meet a single passerby.

An unusual thing - if a teacher is leading a group of children somewhere, he takes out these flags and waves to the cars so that they stop.

<h2>Matsumoto</h2>
<p>
The castle in Matsumoto is one of the most beautiful places I have seen in Japan.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257470575_4d7a126bc5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The reflection in the water is directly adjacent to the castle, so that it seems to be floating in the air.
<p/>

<p>
Closer to the station is a modern area with multi-storey shops and restaurants.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255698622_b2edb89e70_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Matsumoto is apparently a popular city among local tourists, so hotels here are slightly above the national average. Here is the price tag of the inexpensive Toyoko Inn chain, a single room is 6-7 thousand yen (more expensive on weekends).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257470425_26c385ca2e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
So I went to spend the night in an Internet cafe. This is a purely Japanese thing - an Internet cafe with closed booths. It looks something like this:
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256985653_a5af6e7b6d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Inside there is a soft mattress and a pillow. There is plenty of legroom under the table.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256627388_d87d69030f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Vending machines with coffee and drinks. Free, just click a button.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257175329_92f83abe28_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Manga library. These cafes are also called manga cafes, because in addition to the Internet and games, there is almost always manga there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257175374_dd7588f10c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I picked up the classics to read.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257470725_9dbc09f91f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Hanging out in such a cafe initially costs 300 yen per half hour, but if you sit for more than 3 hours, it costs about 300 per hour. Per night (10 hours) there's a special rate: 2500 on weekends or 2400 on weekdays. You can hang out only in the common areas, it's only slightly cheaper (four columns on the right). Another 300 yen is a one-time registration fee. These prices, by the way, are also significantly higher than the Japanese average.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257174979_36d926ddc4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The next morning I walked around the city again.

Locals collect water from the spring in canisters. I wonder why, because tap water is also clean.
<p/>

<p>
In daylight, it is clear why it is called “Raven’s Castle” - at night the white stripes on the facade are brightly illuminated, but during the day they are almost invisible compared to the black roofs.
<p/>

<h2>Tsumago - Magome</h2>
<p>
At the end of the 17th century, two main roads were built and equipped, connecting the main cities of Edo (Tokyo) and Kyoto. One of them ran along the seashore - now it is the main highway and the route for high-speed trains. The second went inside the island through the mountains, and was called nakasendo - “middle mountain road.” Its remains can still be seen in the picturesque Kiso Valley.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256275756_f0550a4a95_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The non-high-speed railway line here runs roughly parallel to Nakasendo.

<p>
It is curious that the names of stations on the signs are written large not in hieroglyphs, but in hiragana, so that they can be easily read (reading hieroglyphs is not always obvious, especially in geographical names).

I got off at Nagiso Station and immediately took a local bus to Tsumago.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255545582_29a05ce614_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Tsumago is a post station on the old road. In those distant times, such stations were needed to provide places for lodging and food. In Japan, people traveled mostly on foot because horses were scarce and only wealthy people could afford them.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256474038_da46070b14_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The appearance of this town was reconstructed in the 1960s, and now nothing is being built or sold here.

Old Japan looked something like this. Everything is made of wood, which is why large cities mostly did not survive the war.

Now Tsumago mainly has shops for tourists.

<p>
From Tsumago to the next station, Magome, the old road has been preserved in some places. The distance is about 17-18 kilometers, so it’s quite possible to walk it in a few hours, even with my backpack.
<p/>

<p>
Since the closest bullet train station is Nagoya, people usually come to this region from the south, and almost everyone takes the Nakasendo in the opposite direction, ending in Tsumago and going back to Nagoya from there. I came from the north and walked in opposite direction.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256474298_c416fe0d48_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Somewhere the old road coincides with the modern road, but mostly it goes along paths or pavements, there are signs everywhere.

<p/>

Magome is much larger than Tsumago.

And there are many more tourists here; apparently, many come just to look at Magome, without walking far along the road.

<h2>Nagoya</h2>
<p>
Nagoya is the third largest city in Japan, located approximately halfway between Tokyo and Osaka.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257270399_c174986c75_h.jpg"/>
<p>
First of all, I went to Nagoya Castle.
<p/>

<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255795017_1927e26252_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The castle grounds are quite large and are partially surrounded by a dry moat.
<p/>

This is where I came as close to it as possible.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257270154_9ea4f394ce_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The castle in Nagoya was reconstructed from scratch after the war.

<p>
There is a subway in Nagoya that looks the same as the one in Tokyo.

<p/>

<p>
The fare is between 200 and 300 yen. Note the sign at the top right - text in Japanese, English, Korean, Chinese and Portuguese. Portuguese because there is a large Brazilian diaspora in this city.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255795427_411e87a314_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The center is the area around the railway station.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256523421_3619017765_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The railway station is a very long shopping center with underground platforms.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256523551_6f7268c78a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are several high-rise buildings around it.

<h2>Inuyama</h2>
<p>
One of the surviving old Japanese castles is located in a suburb of Nagoya called Inuyama. The ride from the central station is only 30 minutes.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255483172_d39451d3f3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a map of the city at the station. For some reason it says "Forward!!! Inuyama" at the top.

The river marks the border between Aichi and Gifu prefectures. The city on this side is called Kakamigahara.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256412793_187f366890_h.jpg"/>

And the station there is called Unuma. From this station with a transfer you can go further towards Kyoto.

<h2>Hikone</h2>
<p>
Between Nagoya and Kyoto there is another city with an old castle - Hikone, right on the main railway line, although without a stop for high-speed trains.

As usual, it is surrounded by a large moat of complex shape, but certainly with right angles (in Europe, castles and fortresses are usually round).

If you walk around the castle and reach the farthest point from the entrance, then just a couple of hundred meters away you will find Lake Biwa - a fairly large lake that stretches almost all the way to Kyoto.

On one of the fences hung a series of posters with advice on how to use smartphones, the Internet, etc. Here they advise not to save credit card data on children’s phones so that they cannot buy applications and goods in games.

Standard Japanese toilet with control panel under the right hand. It is unusual here that the washbasin is located on the lid of the toilet tank, so water after washing hands goes into the tank - economically.
