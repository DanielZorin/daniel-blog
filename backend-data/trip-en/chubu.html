<h1>Japan: Fuji Kawaguchiko, Kofu, Shiojiri, Matsumoto, Tsumago, Magome, Nagoya, Inuyama, Hikone</h1>
<i>3-5 December 2017</i>
<h2>Fuji</h2>
<p>
Mount Fuji is a symbol of Japan. It is located not far from Tokyo, but it is quite rare to see the peak even from a close distance due to clouds and fog. Winter is the best time for this, and I was incredibly lucky: that day there was not a cloud in the sky, Fuji was visible even from the center of Tokyo, and I drove even closer - to Lake Kawaguchi on the northern slopes.

<p>
The easiest and fastest way to get to the city of Fuji-Kawaguchiko is by direct bus from Tokyo, although there is also a railway.

There is a small hill where the funicular goes, but it’s not difficult to climb on foot in about 30 minutes.

<h2>Kofu</h2>
<p>
From Lake Kawaguchi I took a bus to the nearest train station on a major line - Kofu. The station is in this shopping center.

Buses in Japan have an interesting payment system. When entering, you need to take a piece of paper on which the number of the current stop is printed. When exiting, you need to pay the driver; the price, depending on the number on the piece of paper, is indicated on the board above.

Karaoke. There are a lot of such establishments in Japan. Unlike Russia, where karaoke is just a restaurant where someone can sing in front of everyone, in Japan there are private rooms with good walls for rent. Half an hour here costs 180 yen during the day or 350 yen in the evening (the top price is a discount for schoolchildren). You can also take unlimited (bottom line) - 800 yen during the day until 8 pm, or 1680 yen per night. In principle, it is quite possible to spend the night there if you wish.

<h2>Shiojiri</h2>
<p>
A short transfer in the city of Shiojiri. It is interesting only because of its name, which means “salt ass”. Frankly.

<h2>Matsumoto</h2>
<p>
The castle in Matsumoto is one of the most beautiful places I have seen in Japan.

The reflection in the water is directly adjacent to the castle, so that it seems to be floating in the air.

Matsumoto is apparently a popular city among local tourists, so hotels here are slightly above the national average. Here is the price tag of the inexpensive Toyoko Inn chain, a single room is 6-7 thousand yen (more expensive on weekends).

<p>
So I went to spend the night in an Internet cafe. This is a purely Japanese thing - an Internet cafe with closed booths. It looks something like this:
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256985653_1541bd4556_o.jpg">
<p>
Inside there is a soft mattress and a pillow. There is plenty of legroom under the table.
<p/>

<p>
Manga library. These cafes are also called manga cafes, because in addition to the Internet and games, there is almost always manga there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257175374_d4b0a82661_o.jpg">

I picked up the classics to read.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257470725_d0abf97f6a_o.jpg">
<p>
Hanging out in such a cafe initially costs 300 yen per half hour, but if you sit for more than 3 hours, it costs about 300 per hour. Per night (10 hours) there's a special rate: 2500 on weekends or 2400 on weekdays. You can hang out only in the common areas, it's only slightly cheaper (four columns on the right). Another 300 yen is a one-time registration fee. These prices, by the way, are also significantly higher than the Japanese average.
<p/>

<h2>Tsumago - Magome</h2>
<p>
At the end of the 17th century, two main roads were built and equipped, connecting the main cities of Edo (Tokyo) and Kyoto. One of them ran along the seashore - now it is the main highway and the route for high-speed trains. The second went inside the island through the mountains, and was called nakasendo - “middle mountain road.” Its remains can still be seen in the picturesque Kiso Valley.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256275756_9ee1c01bf9_o.jpg">
<p>
The non-high-speed railway line here runs roughly parallel to Nakasendo.

It is curious that the names of stations on the signs are written large not in hieroglyphs, but in hiragana, so that they can be easily read (reading hieroglyphs is not always obvious, especially in geographical names).

<p>
Tsumago is a post station on the old road. In those distant times, such stations were needed to provide places for lodging and food. In Japan, people traveled mostly on foot because horses were scarce and only wealthy people could afford them.

From Tsumago to the next station, Magome, the old road has been preserved in some places. The distance is about 17-18 kilometers, so it’s quite possible to walk it in a few hours, even with my backpack.

Since the closest bullet train station is Nagoya, people usually come to this region from the south, and almost everyone takes the Nakasendo in the opposite direction, ending in Tsumago and going back to Nagoya from there. I came from the north and walked in opposite direction.

Somewhere the old road coincides with the modern road, but mostly it goes along paths or pavements, there are signs everywhere.
