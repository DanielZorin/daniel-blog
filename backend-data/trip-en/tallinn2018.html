<h1>Estonia: Narva, Tallinn</h1>
<i>4, 6 February 2018</i>
<h2>Narva</h2>
<p>
From Moscow you can cheaply travel by land to two cities in the EU: Tallinn and Vilnius (Helsinki is a little more expensive). That winter I decided to go to good old Tallinn for a couple of days, and the road there goes, as always, through Narva. You need to take a ticket for the Moscow-Tallinn train to Ivangorod station, cross the border on foot, and get to Tallinn by bus, or on the same Moscow-Tallinn train. A ticket from Narva costs about 10 euros, a bus costs the same if you buy it on the spot, but you can catch a ticket in advance for 1 euro. I could take the train too: while the train slowly passes the border, you can easily have time to cross the bridge to Narva and walk to the station, despite the fact that it is not even that close. I had a bus ticket, so there was no need to rush.

<h2>Tallinn</h2>
<p>
When you enter Tallinn, the first thing you see is something like this:
<p/>

<p>
Especially if you come from the east, where most of these areas are.

But it looks like the area is newer.

And finally, completely Europe - there are 5 floors, not 10 .
