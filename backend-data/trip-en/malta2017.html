<h1>Malta</h1>
<i>16-19 January 2017</i>
<h2>Flight</h2>
<p>
I was lucky to get a window seat both on arrival and departure (although it was Ryanair both times), so I looked at Malta from above. Approach is from the southern side of the island, even if the plane is flying from more northern Italy.

<h2>Valletta and Mdina</h2>
<p>
I really liked Malta <a href="https://goo.gl/vgjuVD">the first time</a>, and I wanted to come again and see many places that I didn’t have enough time for then. Less than three years have passed before I returned. During this time, the price of travel has risen sharply; if previously a ticket for the whole day cost 1.5 euros, now one trip costs 1.25 euros (if you buy a ticket for 12 trips), however, transfers within 90 minutes are free. I lived again north of Valletta in the city of St. Julian's, in winter the hotel costs 20 euros per day.

<p>
First, let's go through already familiar places. This is Mdina. Now I know that the first season of Game of Thrones was filmed there, before filming moved to <a href="https://goo.gl/NZVFM7">Dubrovnik</a>.

<h2>Cottonera</h2>
<p>
South of Valletta on the other side of the harbor are three cities: Birgu, Bormla and Senglea, known as the Three Cities or Cottonera (after the Grand Master Cottonera, under whom their fortifications were built). Birgu and Senglea occupy two narrow and long peninsulas, and Bormla seems to connect them. These cities also have Italian names: respectively, Vittoriosa ("Victory City"), Cospicua ("Notable") and Invicta ("Invincible").

<p>
Birgu was the capital of Malta in the 16th century, and withstood an Ottoman siege in 1565. After this, a new capital was built, named after the conqueror of the Turks, Jean de Valette.

Fort Sant'Angelo at the very end of the peninsula. A few years ago, half of the castle came under the sovereignty of <a href="https://juan.livejournal.com/488730.html">The Order of Malta</a> for 50 years. The second half of the castle is occupied by a private company; there is no access inside.

<h2>Marsaxlokk</h2>
<p>
In the south of Malta there is a town called Marsaxlokk, famous for its port with wooden fishing boats.
<p/>

<h2>Gozo</h2>
<p>
The state of Malta occupies two islands - the large island of Malta and the small Gozo. In Maltese it is called Għawdex, which is pronounced roughly like "Audesh". There is also a small island called Comino in the middle, but it is uninhabited. Gozo can be reached by ferry from the northern tip of Malta for just under €5 return.

The port is located in the city of Mgarr. From here you can take a bus to the center of the island. Tickets from Malta are valid here, moreover, I even managed to make it within 90 minutes from the moment I boarded the bus from the hotel, although the crossing took almost 30 minutes.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257161879_d592e3bd03_o.jpg">
