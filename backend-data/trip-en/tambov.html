<h1>Russia: Tambov, Lipetsk, Yelets</h1>
<i>25-27 December 2017</i>
<h2>Tambov</h2>
<p>
After a pause of almost two years in traveling around the regions of Russia, my first trip, of course, was to the two regions closest to Moscow, where I had not been: Tambov and Lipetsk. First there was Tambov.
<p/>

<p>
This region is one of the poorest, but I chose the right time for my visit - in winter you can’t see anything bad under the snow. Later I read a review from Varlamov and was surprised.
<p/>

<p>
There are no recognizable sights known throughout the country in Tambov, but it seems that the center has been preserved quite well (perhaps because the city was behind the front line during the war).
<p/>

<p>
Several pleasant squares with bell towers and monasteries.

<p>
The river embankment looks good. Granite and road above, promenade below.

<p>
There are quite a few beautiful mansions in the center.

They don’t hesitate to put up advertisements brazenly.
<p/>

Post office.

<p>
It seems that all efforts were devoted to the restoration of the churches - they were all polished to a shine and painted with bright colors. Especially this one.
<p/>

<p>
The main shopping center is almost on the central square.

<p>
In the middle of a rather one-story area, an absolutely unexpected Gothic church rises.

On the wall of one of the houses, someone is making paintings from caps of Coca-Cola, Sprite and other drinks.

<p>
There are other more traditional housing and communal art compositions in the yard.

<p>
There are signs at bus stops, but they don’t look like they work properly anywhere.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255603131_1cd7c2900c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The bus station is new, lined with the cheapest square panels, like some kind of Pyaterochka. On the neighboring house there is a Coca-Cola advertisement on the entire wall.
<p/>

<p>
It's cheap in Tambov. You won't find a business lunch at this price in Moscow.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256648800_cee8302407_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The bus driver has a poster: when you sit in front of such girls in a bus, you start to appreciate the quality of Russian roads. <i>Implying that their tits would bounce when the bus bounces on potholes.</i>

<h2>Lipetsk</h2>
<p>
Lipetsk is very different from neighboring Tambov. This is a relatively rich region (in particular, the NLMK metallurgical plant is located here), which is immediately noticeable by the large number of new buildings and shopping centers.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257112294_ea53fbab99_h.jpg"/>
<p>
First I got to the town of Gryazi ("Muds"), a suburb of Lipetsk, where the railway station is located. There is a station in the city center, but many transit trains stop only at Gryazi station.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256564283_5bc681f304_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The name of the city is certainly funny. I understand everything, the mud is probably therapeutic, but still.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256366181_499f1e5007_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is mud here and it is not medicinal.
<p/>

<p>
In Gryazi there are two monuments to Lenin at a distance of 500 meters from each other.
<p/>

<p/>

<p>
Now Lipetsk itself. The city is quite elongated along the main wide streets, there are all sorts of administrative buildings. Central square.
<p/>

<p/>

<p/>

There is a curious park with metal sculptures near the hillside.

<p>
Artemy Lebedev devoted about half of his story about Lipetsk to one building: “The building is so majestic and massive that every window in it looks like the cannon embrasure of a galleon.” I decided to find it, and with some simple manipulations with Yandex maps I got the address.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256366826_275ea8dc50_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The building is epic.

<h2>Yelets</h2>
<p>
The third city I visited on this trip was Yelets - one of 41 cities on the list of historical cities in Russia. As much as I was lucky with the weather in Tambov, I was just as unlucky in Yelets, where I was literally the next day. All the snow had melted, there was dirt and bare trees everywhere.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256510654_7d2d49c783_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Outside the center the dirt could be kneaded.

There are many wooden houses on this side of the river.

Tile appears closer to the center, but restoration is still lacking.

The ramp in the skate park near the river, where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWkUdWe0Cfc">the first rap battle of the Yelets League</a> was filmed.

<p>
There is surprisingly little advertising and signage, perhaps because the city is not a capital city.

An interesting temple, exactly half of it was painted on the outside, and the other half was without paint at all.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256806290_c930ce428f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There's emptiness inside.

House of charity. I wonder if the inscription has been restored, or was it hidden under something for a long time?

<p>
And in Yelets I came across one of the most unusual monuments to Lenin. It seems that they deliberately doused him with paint so that he would appear to be covered in blood.
