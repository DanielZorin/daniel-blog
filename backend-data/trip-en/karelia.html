<h1>Russia: Saint Petersburg, Petrozavodsk, Kizhi, Vyshny Volochyok</h1>
<i>20-24 June 2013</i>
<h2>Saint Petersburg</h2>
<p>
During my short fifth visit to St. Petersburg, I devoted a small amount of free time mainly to exploring Vasilyevsky Island.
<p/>

<p>
Business negotiations took up most of the time.

The hostel where I lived <a href="../petersburg">last time</a> finally put up a sign.

Something has been destroyed in Petrogradka, there is a mountain of stones.

Confluence. The Scarlet Sails festival was approaching.

<p>
Bolshoi Avenue of Vasilievsky Island is interesting because on this one street there are two monuments to Lenin. The first one stands opposite the administration.
<p/>

The second one is opposite the hospital.

<p>
They say there is a third one, on the territory of the plant at the very end of the avenue. I didn't see him through the holes in the fences.
<p/>

<p>
Signs about Lenin are found all the time; they are hung for the most insignificant reasons.

The Leningrad Metro named after Lenin was awarded the Order of Lenin.

There are other interesting sculptures on Bolshoy Prospekt. The monument to firefighters is epic.
<p/>

<p>
Unexpectedly, a monument to Sobchak (the first post-Soviet city governor)! I was not aware that such a thing existed.
<p/>

<p>
There is no monument to Kirov, but there is a gorgeous cultural center.
<p/>

<p>
Due to its size, this cathedral is clearly visible from the city center if you walk across the bridge to Vasilyevsky Island. Up close, it looks a little more modest.
<p/>

<p>
At the end of Bolshoy Prospekt there is a marine terminal where cruise ships arrive. At the entrance, passengers are greeted by an orchestra. Inside there is a tourist information desk where they hand out maps of the city center, a unique case for Russia. By the way, this is not the case at the information center on Palace Square, at least not last year.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254659737_f6d83911e0_o.jpg">
<p>
Seeing the Gulf of Finland from Vasilyevsky Island is not easy. The coastline is occupied by cargo docks, and a section of road is being built there connecting the south and north of the city. unless you check into the Park Inn hotel on the upper floors.
<p/>

<p>
This is what the promenade along the shore looks like. There are no people at all, although it is close to the center of St. Petersburg.
<p/>

<p>
In the distance, some kind of Manhattan is being built on the shore. To the left of here is another port, as I understand it, ferries go from there, there is even a special entrance for cars.
<p/>

On the left is Decembrist Island. It used to be called Goloday (in Russian: starve), oddly enough, in honor of an English man whose last name was Holiday.
<p/>

And finally, we come to the Primorskaya metro station, the terminus on the green line.
<p/>

<p>
As a bonus track there will be the epic Palace of Soviets, located near the Moskovskaya metro station. The highway leading to Moscow begins nearby.
<p/>

In front of the palace stands probably the most expressive monument to Lenin.

<h2>Petrozavodsk</h2>
<p>
Oddly enough, the name of the city of Petrozavodsk comes not from the word “factory” (zavod), but from the word “water” (za-vod'). The capital of Karelia is a fairly developed and civilized city. It is enough to note that bus travel here costs 20 rubles, it's more expensive only in St. Petersburg and Moscow. The buses advertise vacancies with salaries >20,000, so the standard of living here is not bad.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255910067_41aab2de5b_o.jpg">
<p>
Although Petrozavodsk was founded around the same time as St. Petersburg, it cannot boast of chic architecture, although the city center is all quite clean, the houses in it are painted and are not falling apart. The beauty is concentrated on the embankment of Lake Onega.
<p/>

Petrozavodsk is the first city in my memory that takes the institution of sister cities seriously. To be honest, what is the point of this idea, what profit will come from it, is unclear. What, residents of Petrozavodsk in Germany should definitely go to Tübingen, and residents of Tübingen should go to Petrozavodsk?

An excellent hotel in Petrozavodsk costs only 1000 rubles. The only problem is that it is on the outskirts. The house numbers on the street at some point jump from ~20 to ~45, apparently because the village huts were demolished and a modern block was being built in their place.

You go out onto a wide street, and here is Finland. In Finland, a significant number of cottages in rural areas have roofs painted this color.

<h2>Kizhi</h2>
<p>
To get to Kizhi Island from Petrozavodsk, you need to travel by hydrofoil for about an hour and 15 minutes. It costs as much as 2,300 rubles (  another 250 for entry to the island), which is quite expensive by Russian standards, although in Europe trips by ship are even more expensive. In general, in Russia, many famous places are expensive and difficult to get to because of their remoteness, but sometimes you can pamper yourself. But the most amazing thing is that ordinary people still live on Kizhi Island.

The place itself is of amazing beauty, and in fact unique, since wooden churches are very rare.

From the water you can best see that the entire church is now raised above the ground for restoration. Naturally, you can’t go inside.
<p/>

There is a cemetery around the church. Actually, that’s what it’s called - Kizhi churchyard.

As I already said, there is a permanent population on the island. Tourists do not go to that part of the island very often, since most come on excursions and have no free time, but it cannot be said that no one goes there at all. By the way, at the entrance where they sell tickets, they advise against leaving the wooden platforms located in the tourist part of the island because of snakes. But on the rest of the island there are no platforms, just an ordinary road, like this:

Moreover, all houses are protected monuments.

The island has bicycles, motorbikes, at least one police car, and even a bus! Here it is parked.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257024904_f42beb6b06_o.jpg">
<p>
But the main mode of transport, of course, is boat. Opposite every house in the village of Yamka there is a small pier; many have motor boats. In general, Kizhi is very close to the mainland; if the population were larger, a bridge could be built. But so far they are not trying to increase the number of tourists.

<h2>Vyshny Volochyok</h2>
<p>
From St. Petersburg to Moscow it takes from 4 (Sapsan) to 8 hours by train, and 11-12 hours by car. Hitchhiking is about the same, drivers pick you up pretty quickly. The longest wait was near Tver, but even then it was only about 20 minutes. In Vyshny Volochyok I made a break for the night. In my opinion, Volochyok is the funniest name of the city, even cooler than Vydropuzhsk, located 20 kilometers further along the highway.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255732001_1458bccd1e_o.jpg">
<p>
The main attraction of Volochyok is the traffic light. As the truck driver who drove us to the city put it, this is a traffic light that fucked the whole of Russia. Due to the fact that the Moscow-St. Petersburg highway runs through the city center in zigzags and periodically stops at traffic lights, huge traffic jams form, starting another ten kilometers from the entrance to Volochyok.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256775970_2d2ecd8c12_o.jpg">

The city is very dark at night. There is almost no lighting, a bunch of dilapidated houses with broken windows. The feeling that you are in the village, and now the village geeks will stab you in the heart.
