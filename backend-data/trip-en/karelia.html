<h1>Russia: Saint Petersburg, Petrozavodsk, Kizhi, Vyshny Volochyok</h1>
<i>20-24 June 2013</i>
<h2>Saint Petersburg</h2>
<p>
During my short fifth visit to St. Petersburg, I devoted a small amount of free time mainly to exploring Vasilyevsky Island.
<p/>

<p>
Business negotiations took up most of the time.
<p/>

<p>
The hostel where I lived <a href="../petersburg">last time</a> finally put up a sign.
<p/>

<p>
Something has been destroyed in Petrogradka, there is a mountain of stones.
<p/>

<p>
Confluence. The Scarlet Sails festival was approaching.
<p/>

<p>
Bolshoi Avenue of Vasilievsky Island is interesting because on this one street there are two monuments to Lenin. The first one stands opposite the administration.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255594878_2d5dd1f976_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The second one is opposite the hospital.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257567099_85cf0b4413_h.jpg"/>
<p>
They say there is a third one, on the territory of the plant at the very end of the avenue. I didn't see him through the holes in the fences.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255391656_1c64494f44_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Signs about Lenin are found all the time; they are hung for the most insignificant reasons.
<p/>

<p>
The Leningrad Metro named after Lenin was awarded the Order of Lenin.
<p/>

<p>
There are other interesting sculptures on Bolshoy Prospekt. The monument to firefighters is epic.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256435335_5b672750bd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Unexpectedly, a monument to Sobchak (the first post-Soviet city governor)! I was not aware that such a thing existed.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255391796_6ab59f304d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is no monument to Kirov, but there is a gorgeous cultural center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255594958_b923618340_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Due to its size, this cathedral is clearly visible from the city center if you walk across the bridge to Vasilyevsky Island. Up close, it looks a little more modest.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255391901_9cab9d918d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At the end of Bolshoy Prospekt there is a marine terminal where cruise ships arrive. At the entrance, passengers are greeted by an orchestra. Inside there is a tourist information desk where they hand out maps of the city center, a unique case for Russia. By the way, this is not the case at the information center on Palace Square, at least not last year.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254659737_eb2c575b43_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Seeing the Gulf of Finland from Vasilyevsky Island is not easy. The coastline is occupied by cargo docks, and a section of road is being built there connecting the south and north of the city. unless you check into the Park Inn hotel on the upper floors.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256435500_c257c42b62_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is what the promenade along the shore looks like. There are no people at all, although it is close to the center of St. Petersburg.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256138959_1011bf0ad2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A monument across the whole house.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256435530_e64cae1c62_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the distance, some kind of Manhattan is being built on the shore. To the left of here is another port, as I understand it, ferries go from there, there is even a special entrance for cars.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255595188_6902254d6b_h.jpg"/>

Luxurious house on stilts.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254659832_9ef3f3ea4f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On the left is Decembrist Island. It used to be called Goloday (in Russian: starve), oddly enough, in honor of an English man whose last name was Holiday.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255392116_2e9f94fefd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And finally, we come to the Primorskaya metro station, the terminus on the green line.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256435620_e0638bf0f3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
As a bonus track there will be the epic Palace of Soviets, located near the Moskovskaya metro station. The highway leading to Moscow begins nearby.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255392191_134c08ece3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In front of the palace stands probably the most expressive monument to Lenin.
<p/>

<h2>Petrozavodsk</h2>
<p>
Oddly enough, the name of the city of Petrozavodsk comes not from the word “factory” (zavod), but from the word “water” (za-vod'). The capital of Karelia is a fairly developed and civilized city. It is enough to note that bus travel here costs 20 rubles, it's more expensive only in St. Petersburg and Moscow. The buses advertise vacancies with salaries >20,000, so the standard of living here is not bad.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255910067_ef239a7a7d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Although Petrozavodsk was founded around the same time as St. Petersburg, it cannot boast of chic architecture, although the city center is all quite clean, the houses in it are painted and are not falling apart. The beauty is concentrated on the embankment of Lake Onega.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256839033_e18aa7ccd6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are sculptures there.

<p>
Petrozavodsk is the first city in my memory that takes the institution of sister cities seriously. To be honest, what is the point of this idea, what profit will come from it, is unclear. What, residents of Petrozavodsk in Germany should definitely go to Tübingen, and residents of Tübingen should go to Petrozavodsk?

There is also a site with exercise machines in Petrozavodsk, just like in Europe and Brazil.

An administrative building and a monument to the man who they wanted to make the head of Finland after its conquest in 1939, but failed.

Advertising space is available for rent on street signs in Petrozavodsk (like in <a href="../kazakhstan">Alma-Ata</a>, but bolder).

<p>
An excellent hotel in Petrozavodsk costs only 1000 rubles. The only problem is that it is on the outskirts. The house numbers on the street at some point jump from ~20 to ~45, apparently because the village huts were demolished and a modern block was being built in their place.

Next to the new buildings there are many monuments of a bygone era.

What is interesting here is not the garbage cans, but the quality of the road surface in the yard.

You go out onto a wide street, and here is Finland. In Finland, a significant number of cottages in rural areas have roofs painted this color.
<p/>

Karelia generally has a lot in common with Finland.

In Petrozavodsk the white nights are even whiter than in St. Petersburg.

Cafe "McDuck", the photo of which can be seen in the collections of clones, is going through hard times. A McDonald's opened in the house opposite.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257384624_3613b3fab1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
McDuck is named after Scrooge McDuck. The prices there are the same as in McDonald's or even higher.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257385454_3d0e8cd8c5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also the only restaurant of local cuisine, Karelian Gornitsa, which I forgot to photograph. And also an anti-cafe.

<h2>Kizhi</h2>
<p>
To get to Kizhi Island from Petrozavodsk, you need to travel by hydrofoil for about an hour and 15 minutes. It costs as much as 2,300 rubles (  another 250 for entry to the island), which is quite expensive by Russian standards, although in Europe trips by ship are even more expensive. In general, in Russia, many famous places are expensive and difficult to get to because of their remoteness, but sometimes you can pamper yourself. But the most amazing thing is that ordinary people still live on Kizhi Island.
<p/>

<p/>

<p>
The place itself is of amazing beauty, and in fact unique, since wooden churches are very rare.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257024549_5f91f80c1f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Especially those that have been in place for 300 years.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257318795_91e6835250_h.jpg"/>
<p>
From the water you can best see that the entire church is now raised above the ground for restoration. Naturally, you can’t go inside.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257025079_54c2e9d639_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a cemetery around the church. Actually, that’s what it’s called - Kizhi churchyard.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255547567_a3918555de_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Nearby there are houses with ethnographic exhibitions.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257318700_872d903636_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Judging by the signs, the houses were brought from different villages in Karelia. And even a chapel.

<p>
As I already said, there is a permanent population on the island. Tourists do not go to that part of the island very often, since most come on excursions and have no free time, but it cannot be said that no one goes there at all. By the way, at the entrance where they sell tickets, they advise against leaving the wooden platforms located in the tourist part of the island because of snakes. But on the rest of the island there are no platforms, just an ordinary road, like this:
<p/>

<p>
Village of Yamka.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257318855_3e3820332e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
They live here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256278106_60debc4686_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Moreover, all houses are protected monuments.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256278141_511e738f58_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Satellite dishes are very popular in small towns.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256476393_f066cfa12d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The island has bicycles, motorbikes, at least one police car, and even a bus! Here it is parked.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257024904_cf27309716_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But the main mode of transport, of course, is boat. Opposite every house in the village of Yamka there is a small pier; many have motor boats. In general, Kizhi is very close to the mainland; if the population were larger, a bridge could be built. But so far they are not trying to increase the number of tourists.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256278331_5b8f3515a4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Unfortunately, it was not possible to go to other villages, since there was very little time left before the boat departed. The way back goes through the cemetery.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257319145_02347e9921_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There seem to be quite a lot of people living on the islands on Lake Onega.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257025139_210c7293a2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Or at least they have dachas.

<h2>Vyshny Volochyok</h2>
<p>
From St. Petersburg to Moscow it takes from 4 (Sapsan) to 8 hours by train, and 11-12 hours by car. Hitchhiking is about the same, drivers pick you up pretty quickly. The longest wait was near Tver, but even then it was only about 20 minutes. In Vyshny Volochyok I made a break for the night. In my opinion, Volochyok is the funniest name of the city, even cooler than Vydropuzhsk, located 20 kilometers further along the highway.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255732001_d2b332bc9a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The main attraction of Volochyok is the traffic light. As the truck driver who drove us to the city put it, this is a traffic light that fucked the whole of Russia. Due to the fact that the Moscow-St. Petersburg highway runs through the city center in zigzags and periodically stops at traffic lights, huge traffic jams form, starting another ten kilometers from the entrance to Volochyok.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256775970_4ddca4d0ae_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is an overpass across the highway, but people still run across.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255934313_061d9d13a8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also a McDonald's in Volochyok, which is also an important attraction.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255001842_d7daf6e37a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The city is very dark at night. There is almost no lighting, a bunch of dilapidated houses with broken windows. The feeling that you are in the village, and now the village geeks will stab you in the heart.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256776500_f764967a3e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
During the day it just looks like a neglected, unkempt poor city, but the people don’t seem to be completely embittered.
