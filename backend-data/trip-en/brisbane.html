<h1>Australia: Darwin, Adelaide, Brisbane, Gold Coast</h1>
<i>18-24 March 2019</i>
<h2>Darwin</h2>
<p>
The first city I visited in Australia was Darwin, the capital of the Northern Territory. This city is very different from other major cities in the country because of its climate, which is similar to neighboring Indonesia: very hot and humid. Around Darwin, tropical forests stretch for many kilometers, which in the interior of the mainland after some time turn into desert.

<p>
The area around Darwin is home to a huge number of saltwater crocodiles. Once upon a time, these very dangerous animals lived throughout Southeast Asia, but gradually people exterminated them in more densely populated areas so as not to have unpleasant encounters. Now they remain mainly in Northern Australia and off the coast of New Guinea. Swimming in the sea and rivers around Darwin is very dangerous. Not far from the city, for 30 dollars you can ride a boat down the river, where crocodiles will jump out of the water to catch meat on a fishing rod, however, getting there without a car is problematic. You can also see crocodiles in captivity in the very center of Darwin.

<p>
Here you can plunge into a pool with a crocodile in a glass container, although it is very expensive - about $100.

You can touch the little crocodile. It feels very smooth and cool to the touch.
<p/>

<p>
You can also leave meat for small crocodiles on a fishing rod.

Darwin is a small city, the center is about five by five streets, the residential area is quite large, but the population is only 150k. Darwin Main Street:

<p>
What best characterizes this city is that at 6 pm absolutely all the shops on the pedestrian tourist street were closed, as if it were 4 am and not 6 pm.

<p>
Only local residents sat on the benches - Australian aborigines, who both in appearance and in social status have much in common with African-Americans in the United States. The Northern Territory has the largest percentage of Aboriginal people in its population.

<h2>Adelaide</h2>
<p>
They say Adelaide is a boring city with nothing to see. Fortunately, for me it was actually the first city in Australia, so everything was new and interesting.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255995678_e87589b411_o.jpg">
<p>
The first thing I felt when leaving the airport was coolness. The climate is just like in France.

<p>
It is the country's main passenger hub, with long-distance trains to Darwin and Perth, as well as Melbourne and Sydney. Trains to Darwin and Perth, however, are more tourist than passenger, for obvious reasons: flying is cheaper and faster.
<p/>

Adelaide has a pretty good system, several lines, and trains run frequently, every 15 minutes.

Many streets have awnings over the sidewalk, a phenomenon very common in Australia.

There is a monument to Queen Victoria in every city in Australia and New Zealand. Adelaide is named after Queen Adelaide, wife of William IV, Victoria's uncle.

From this monument you can look at a small panorama of the city, which is mostly obscured by the newly built stadium.

Here I first became acquainted with ibises - in Australia, these birds are something like crows, they are also predatory and can eat weakened pigeons.

The area where I lived. Although it is one-story, there were buses to the center every 10 minutes very close by, and a train station was a 30-minute walk away.

Formally, the city of Adelaide ends with the historical center, surrounded by a chain of parks along the perimeter. There are other cities nearby, some of which are essentially residential areas, while others are full-fledged cities with their own center. For example, the city of Port Adelaide is not inferior to the capital in terms of the elegance of its buildings.

Brisbane, the third city in Australia after Sydney and Melbourne, is, in principle, in no way inferior to them - there are no less skyscrapers and offices.

In Brisbane, as in Adelaide, there is an extensive system of suburban trains; they run quite often through the city center, then reaching distant suburbs.

Travel costs are reasonable (almost an hour to Glass House for $4), with the exception of the airport train for $20 AUD. If you have an arrival/departure during the day, you can take a free shuttle to a nearby shopping center, from where regular city buses depart.

A very pleasant area, three supermarkets within walking distance (and McDonald's), several stops by train to the center. I would like to note that in Australia, even in residential areas, there is incredibly pleasant architecture, not only of private houses, but also of apartment buildings, which are quite common there.

Let's look at a supermarket in Australia. There are three main chains in this country: Woolworth's (similar to Perekrestok), Coles and Aldi. The last brand is familiar to those who have been to Germany, and in Australia it is also a discounter. First, let's look at Aldi in the residential area of ​​Coorparoo in Brisbane. We are immediately greeted by local bananas at 4.49 Australian dollars per kilogram - more than 200 rubles. 1 AUD = 0.7 USD = 50 rubles.

<h2>Glass House Mountains</h2>

Just north of Brisbane, Glass House National Park features volcanic hills somewhat reminiscent of the karst of southern Thailand and Malaysia.
