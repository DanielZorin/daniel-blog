<h1>UAE: Sharjah, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Fujairah, Khor Fakkan</h1>
<i>5-8 May 2018</i>
<h2>Dubai</h2>
<p>
The trip to the UAE turned out to be the most spontaneous of all time. I bought a last-minute tour for $400 for two, which is significantly cheaper than plane tickets, and a couple of days later I arrived in the now visa-free Emirates. The disadvantage of this approach is that it was not I who chose how much time to allocate for this or that city, but I adjusted my plan to three days, which, of course, was not enough. I hope I can visit this country again someday.

We are approaching Dubai. The airport is in the frame, the old city is on the right.

<h2>Sharjah</h2>
<p>
My hotel was located in the city of Sharjah. It is northeast of Dubai, but in fact these cities merge smoothly into each other.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256540985_ba161b963f_o.jpg">
<p>
I didn’t choose the hotel; it was inexpensive, but located far from the center and the bus station. Taking into account the fact that I constantly traveled around the country, if I had chosen it myself, I would have settled in a more expensive/worse place, but closer. But the hotel itself was quite good.
<p/>

The area around is new, they have not yet had time to lay asphalt on all the streets except the main one. Only after a couple of kilometers there is asphalt not on the main road.

Public transport in Sharjah is much worse than in Dubai. There are few buses, and for the two of us, even in terms of money, it was more economical to take a taxi to the center.

The closest public beach to my hotel was a 15-20 minute walk. It was quite possible to swim there, the water is very warm at this time of year, but the beach, of course, is not equipped. The alternative was to go to the beach of the pyramid-shaped Radisson Hotel.

<h2>Fujairah</h2>
<p>
On the third day I visited the emirate of Fujairah, whose main city is not on the northern, but on the eastern coast of the country. There is a direct bus from Sharjah that does not go via Dubai. The road crosses the central desert part of the country.

We are approaching the city of Fujairah. Fujairah is just beginning to be built, so it is now clearly visible that it has one big street along which office high-rises have just appeared.

The final destination of the direct bus from Sharjah is the city of Khor Fakkan. It is an exclave of the emirate of Sharjah in Fujairah.
