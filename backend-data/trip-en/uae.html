<h1>UAE: Sharjah, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Fujairah, Khor Fakkan</h1>
<i>5-8 May 2018</i>
<h2>Dubai</h2>
<p>
The trip to the UAE turned out to be the most spontaneous of all time. I bought a last-minute tour for $400 for two, which is significantly cheaper than plane tickets, and a couple of days later I arrived in the now visa-free Emirates. The disadvantage of this approach is that it was not I who chose how much time to allocate for this or that city, but I adjusted my plan to three days, which, of course, was not enough. I hope I can visit this country again someday.

We are approaching Dubai. The airport is in the frame, the old city is on the right.

Below is the emirate of Sharjah, it begins a few kilometers north of the airport.

If there were not 2 floors, but 9-11, one could mistake them for Soviet microdistricts.

First of all, from Sharjah I went to the old city of Dubai (in <a href="../dubai">2012</a>, being in Dubai, I was not in that area).

The old town is old in the sense that it is 50 years old, not 20, but nevertheless it is very different from other areas.
<p/>

In the Dubai metro, you need to sit in the first or last car, then you can admire the views straight ahead.

You can just look at all the skyscrapers, because they are mostly located along the metro line.

<h2>Sharjah</h2>
<p>
My hotel was located in the city of Sharjah. It is northeast of Dubai, but in fact these cities merge smoothly into each other.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256540985_5a389d730e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I didn’t choose the hotel; it was inexpensive, but located far from the center and the bus station. Taking into account the fact that I constantly traveled around the country, if I had chosen it myself, I would have settled in a more expensive/worse place, but closer. But the hotel itself was quite good.
<p/>

<p>
The area around is new, they have not yet had time to lay asphalt on all the streets except the main one. Only after a couple of kilometers there is asphalt not on the main road.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256244664_fe060acd82_h.jpg"/>
<p>
However, there are plenty of shops around, as well as small cafes, canteens, and shawarma shops.

Public transport in Sharjah is much worse than in Dubai. There are few buses, and for the two of us, even in terms of money, it was more economical to take a taxi to the center.
<p/>

The closest public beach to my hotel was a 15-20 minute walk. It was quite possible to swim there, the water is very warm at this time of year, but the beach, of course, is not equipped. The alternative was to go to the beach of the pyramid-shaped Radisson Hotel.

<h2>Abu Dhabi</h2>
<p>
Like the entire trip to the UAE, the visit to the capital of Abu Dhabi was spontaneous, and there was much less time than needed to be allocated to this city. It takes about 2 hours to get there from Sharjah by direct bus.

After transferring to another bus, I went to the most famous landmark of Abu Dhabi - Sheikh Zayed Mosque. Surprisingly, there are no buses directly there; you can only approach the mosque from the back side, where there is no entrance.

I only managed to go to the shopping center for dinner.

<h2>Fujairah</h2>
<p>
On the third day I visited the emirate of Fujairah, whose main city is not on the northern, but on the eastern coast of the country. There is a direct bus from Sharjah that does not go via Dubai. The road crosses the central desert part of the country.

First comes the sandy desert.

Then it starts to get rocky.

We are approaching the city of Fujairah. Fujairah is just beginning to be built, so it is now clearly visible that it has one big street along which office high-rises have just appeared.

Around some, they haven’t even had time to properly lay asphalt in the parking lots yet.

In the future, apparently this will be the central part of the city.

The final destination of the direct bus from Sharjah is the city of Khor Fakkan. It is an exclave of the emirate of Sharjah in Fujairah.
