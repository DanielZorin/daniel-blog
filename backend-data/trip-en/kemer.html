<h1>Turkey: Kemer</h1>
<i>15 March - 28 April 2022</i>
<h2>Kemer</h2>
<p>
Kemer is the city where people go on vacation to all-inclusive resorts. But still, this is not purely a village with hotels, but a small town where there is (almost) everything you need. And it's really beautiful there.
<p/>

<p>
When I arrived in mid-March, it was completely off-season, there were few people in the city, and the hotels were cheap - less than 20 dollars. View from my hotel.
<p/>

<p>
This area with tiled roads consists mainly of hotels. Residential areas where you can rent an apartment are all farther from the sea.

<p>
Behind the port there is a small sandy beach. It seems to be on the hotel grounds, I don’t understand whether entry is free during the season or not.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52036026812_752f759868_o.jpg">
<p>
It's really useless - there are a couple of offices of large companies that still travel from Antalya. Most long-distance buses do not call at Kemer, and local buses run from the clock tower. There is nothing inside the bus station except the Ataturk monument.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52037064621_9cef15efc6_o.jpg">
<p>
To the north of the center of Kemer there are a row of large star hotels on the sea shore.

In principle, if you live here, you can walk to the city center, it’s 1-1.5 kilometers.

<h2>Çamyuva</h2>
<p>
I live not in Kemer itself, but in the neighboring village of Çamyuva, from where it’s about 5-7 kilometers to Kemer. Here is my aprtment site (about a week later the pool was already filled).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52037118178_48ee30be2d_o.jpg">

<p>
The houses are two-story, each with one apartment per floor.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52037066621_16c736591c_o.jpg">
<p>
It's a 20-minute walk to the sea, but all the infrastructure is close - shops, cheap cafes. Buses run to the center of Kemer every 15-20 minutes.
<p/>

In the surrounding area, some of the buildings are the same communities as mine, and some are private houses. My neighbors are distinguished farmers; they have chickens, geese, and goats.

You can buy strawberries cheaper than in the store (a little later they dropped in price to 20 liras per kilo).

In the cafe closest to me you can eat Adana Kebab for only 45 liras, and they also give you puffed bread, a large plate of salad, yogurt and other snacks for free.
<p/>

<p>
The resort area begins closer to the sea. The hotels there are mostly medium-sized - that is, they are no longer guesthouses with 10 rooms, but also not giants with their own territory and many buildings (although there are still one or two giants).
<p/>

<h2>Tekirova</h2>
<p>
For the first outing from Kemer, I chose the nearest town of Tekirova, where the bus route passing through Çamyuva ends. The Lycian Way passes through Tekirova; there are many interesting things along the way.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52037321274_013e3c7f4f_o.jpg">

<p>
Tekirova is also a resort town, and to a lesser extent residential - it looked a bit empty in the off-season.

The last beach where you can park caravans, of which there are many. There is a dirt road access here from the highway, but there doesn’t seem to be a pedestrian path further to Çamyuva (more precisely, judging by the map it ends in a closed area), so from here I returned to the highway and caught a bus.

<h2>Kiriş</h2>
<p>
Literally on the other side of the river from Çamyuva is the village of Kiriş, separated from Kemer itself by Çalış Hill. From the very beginning I had my eye on the hill in order to somehow climb it
<p/>

<p>
There is a short road from Kemer to Kiriş, passing through a small pass near the mountain. It then abuts the river, and passage for cars there is only open in the summer, when the river dries up, but in principle in the spring you can wade barefoot or ride a bicycle. The road looks like this.

Çalış is an official national park, there are signs and plans for the location of the paths.

There is a road without asphalt to the very top, but driving a car is prohibited.
<p/>

<p>
Most of the road goes along the side closer to Kiriş, from here there are views. It is noticeable that most of Kiriş is fields and gardens, with only one residential area in the foreground. Across the river, Çamyuva is more densely built.
<p/>

<h2>Mount Tahtali</h2>
<p>
One of the main attractions of the Kemer region is Mount Tahtali, which can be climbed by the Olimpos Teleferik cable car.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52037319279_1024f38e99_o.jpg">
<p>
The climb costs 35 euros for tourists, 120 liras for locals (about 8 euros), plus 40 liras for a transfer from the main road to the start of the cable car and back (there are transfers from the center of Kemer that are more expensive, but it was still more convenient for me to get to the turn off the main road than first to the center of Kemer).

Somewhere here there is a hike, you can even buy a one-way ticket for the cable car, but the distance there is long, and the climb is one and a half thousand kilometers.
