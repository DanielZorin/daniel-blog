<h1>Finland: Helsinki, Turku</h1>
<i>8-9 October 2016</i>
<h2>Helsinki</h2>
<p>
Helsinki is one of the last European capitals that remained unvisited by me for a long time. Many consider this city boring, but it is quite interesting, I don’t understand why it is worse than <a href="https://goo.gl/or3Hzo">Oslo</a> or <a href="https://goo.gl/52aD5e">Copenhagen</a>. Of the Scandinavian capitals, probably only <a href="https://goo.gl/ki1fzR">Stockholm</a> will undoubtedly be more interesting.

<p>
The center of Helsinki in some places, for obvious reasons, subtly resembles Russia.

A monument to Emperor Alexander II still stands opposite the main cathedral. Until 1917, his monuments stood in most major cities of the empire, just like there are monuments to Lenin now, but the Bolsheviks removed them all.

These streets are more reminiscent of German cities.

Train Station. It is interesting that the Finnish railway is connected only with the Russian one; there is no passenger service to Sweden, although the gap there is very small, despite the fact that it is located far in the north of Lapland. Finland inherited a wider track than in Europe from the Russian Empire.

Street signs in Helsinki feature various animals. This is for a reason - back in the early 19th century, neighborhoods were named after animals.

Such small rocks are very typical for Scandinavia; if you look closely, such terrain is found in almost all major cities of Finland and Sweden.

Probably the main attraction of Helsinki is the Suomenlinna Fortress ("Finnish Castle"). Under the Swedes it was called Sveaborg - "Swedish Castle".
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256175981_fa9ab5a2a0_o.jpg">
<p>
Suomenlinna is located on a separate island near Helsinki, and ferries go there very often for about 5 euros round trip. Although it is primarily an open-air museum, several hundred people still live on the grounds of the fortress. There is even an underground tunnel from the mainland that even a car can drive through, but it is for official use only.
<p/>

The ferry passes by small rock islands. Some have a couple of hickey houses.

<h2>Turku</h2>
<p>
In Turku I stayed in an unusual hotel - it was a moored cruise ship.

A single room cost 35 euros, which is cheap by Finnish standards. Breakfast is also included - this is generally an exceptional rarity in inexpensive hotels.

<p>
There is a shower in the cabin. On the other floor there was a sauna (where would we be without it in Finland!), which I also managed to go to in the morning.

I sailed first to the Åland Islands, a territory with a special status. It takes about 5 hours to sail there from Turku, and then another 2 hours to Sweden. I did not have a cabin, since I sailed during the day.

Upon arrival in Åland, many passengers immediately boarded the ferry in the opposite direction, without even leaving the city.
