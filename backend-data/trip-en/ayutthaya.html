<h1>Thailand: Aranyaprathet, Lopburi, Ayutthaya, Nakhon Ratchasima, Phanom Rung, Phimai, Nakhon Pathom, Kanchanaburi</h1>
<i>1-11 October 2015</i>
<h2>Aranyaprathet</h2>
<p>
First steps in Thailand: the contrast with Cambodia is quite noticeable. There is a modern shopping center near the border.
<p/>

<p>
The border terminal is fresher.

<p>
There is a huge market on the border.

<p>
The railway goes to Cambodia, but there is no passenger traffic on it. There are trains from Bangkok to Aranyaprathet once a day.

<h2>Lopburi</h2>
<p>
When you arrive at Lopburi station, they immediately let you know what awaits you.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256384051_757ee5699c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Several blocks in the city center are occupied by monkeys.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256383271_e996845fcf_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Their citadel is an ancient Khmer temple, originally Hindu, now Buddhist.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257128924_df8460d144_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Entrance to the temple costs 50 baht, I didn’t go not because I didn’t want to pay $1.5 (although everything is visible behind the fence, in principle), but because the monkeys are creepy, I didn’t want to lose my camera.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255652862_35be0546ad_h.jpg"/>
<p>
They're on rails too.

<p>
Luckily, the monkeys only live in a few blocks.

They are easy to spot by their tightly barred balconies, like in China.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255652772_5b3756c9e7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In general, this is not usually practiced in Thailand.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256382956_0f25776cc4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here the altars are fenced on all sides.
<p/>

Otherwise, they will rob and take away the pink Fanta.
<p/>

<p>
There is a lot of interesting things to do outside the monkey town. There are large ruins of a temple where I went to wander.

<p>
In Thailand, like nowhere else, they like to use corrugated sheets of metal for the exterior decoration of buildings. After some time in high humidity they rust, giving the characteristic color to the streets.

<p>
Any self-respecting Thai city should have its own unique design of street signs (they don’t hang on the walls, but stand on sticks, like road signs) and pillars. Signs often feature images of local landmarks.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256581333_2646596fb1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And on the pillars are all sorts of mythical heroes.

The hotel where I lived is also a landmark. It's not every day you see something so retro.
<p/>

<p>
In Lopburi I began to explore traditional Thai cooking. I went to the first place I came across without an English menu, and randomly ordered a couple of more expensive dishes (for 50 baht, not 30).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256383646_b1f98d2af3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The first guess was not very successful - I chose the boiled chicken feet. Well, at least I tried it, I would never take them on purpose.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255653157_d48698599d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The second course, fortunately, was excellent.

<h2>Ayutthaya</h2>
<p>
Ayutthaya, the capital of Thailand before Bangkok, was destroyed in the second half of the 18th century by the Burmese invasion. Most people come here from Bangkok without an overnight stay, but in my opinion, one day in Ayutthaya is not enough (yes, this is coming from a man who has seen a couple of hundred cities in two hours). At least when traveling on foot or by bike, it takes a lot of time, because Ayutthaya is not small at all. The central part of the city is an island between the rivers, about 3 by 4 kilometers, and there are interesting places outside the island.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256053493_cfe4269c9e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At first, I traditionally explored the city on foot. I walk and walk, but there are still no antiquities.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256053223_c20adebfa8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the historical part of Ayutthaya there are simply huge, wide roads.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256895085_e934f941a9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The island is also crossed by canals.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255121992_45c958aa3f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Finally, a couple of kilometers after the street with hotels and the market, the first temple is Wat Mahathat.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255122092_6044a82756_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is the famous Buddha head in the roots of a tree.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255851436_7ba9b93210_h.jpg"/>
<p>
All temples in Ayutthaya are made of red and black bricks.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255851511_79d6e791fa_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The four largest temples have an entrance fee - 50 baht for foreigners, including this one.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256894460_723f5d5059_h.jpg"/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255851576_60ac4c3d58_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Next door is another temple with paid entrance - Wat Ratchaburana, I explored it from the outside.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255122017_3eb127570a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The road goes through a long park with lakes and statues.

The second main temple is Wat Phra Sisanphet, of which only the foundation and three chedis remain.

It is unclear what the decoration of the street signs symbolizes. It doesn't look like any of the temples.

<p>
On the second day, I decided to go to the Bang Pa-in Royal Palace. You can get there from Ayutthaya by any train going towards Bangkok for 3 baht, the ride takes about 15 minutes. The station is located outside the main island, the easiest way to get there is by ferry, which carries you across the river for 5 baht.
<p/>

<p>
Like some other Thai palaces (Dusit in Bangkok and Nakhon Pathom Palace) it is designed to resemble European architecture.
<p/>

<p>
You cannot take photographs inside the palace, but I dare to assure you that everything there is in the best Baroque traditions.

<p>
The first wife of Rama V died by drowning in the palace pond. All the servants looked at this, and no one saved her, because touching the queen was punishable by death. The king erected an obelisk monument to his wife (who, by the way, was also his half-sister), and he personally composed the epitaph in Thai and English.
<p/>

<p>
Returning from the north of Thailand, I could not help but stop again at Ayutthaya, through which all the roads to Bangkok pass. This time I chartered a bicycle for 50 baht to visit distant attractions. It is very pleasant to drive around the city: the roads are wide, the traffic is calm, and the drivers are polite by Thai standards. On some corner you can stumble upon centuries-old ruins.
<p/>

Driving past Wat Phra Sisanphet and taking a closer look at the field, I noticed that there were some piles of bricks preserved on it. This is the foundation of the former royal palace.

Then I made a march of 8 kilometers along rural roads south of the main island.

<p>
And here I am at the ruins of the Portuguese colony. When Ayutthaya was the capital of Siam, foreign diplomatic missions settled outside the island on the outskirts. Ayutthaya was a huge city at that time, by some estimates the largest city in the world in the 18th century.

A few more kilometers to the north, and I found myself in a place familiar from last time - on the confluence. Only from the opposite side.

The area here is completely residential and quiet. Opposite the entrance to the temple there is a like.

Here in the courtyard stood the most unusual stupa in Ayutthaya. I don’t know by what miracle it survived. Children were playing around.

Not far from here there is another ferry for 5 baht, which allowed to quickly return to the center.

<h2>Nakhon Ratchasima</h2>
<p>
Nakhon Ratchasima or Korat is a large city in northeastern Thailand. Good as a base for visiting the sights of the region, but in five days I found several interesting places in the city itself.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256725783_d0a2455087_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The first interesting place is the hotel where I rented a room with air conditioning for 300 baht. It has its own atmosphere, as if you were in an American motel from a Western movie, several decades older.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255796757_ccee5380dd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In principle, the room is spacious, there is a lot of furniture, there is air conditioning. There is no Internet, but in Thailand this is not a big deal, because there are cheap unlimited 3G tariffs.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256726558_f012d372af_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But the walls are somewhat shabby.

<p>
In the main square there is a monument to Grandma Mo, who saved the people of Korat from captivity during the Laotian invasion in 1826. In the background you can see the main shopping center - now there is one in every more or less decent city in Thailand.
<p/>

<p/>

Opposite it, the store was completely abandoned, and no one even bothered to cover the entrance.

Here I first became acquainted with the phenomenon of sushi for 5 baht (the 11th piece is free!).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256726258_3584fe5ab6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Before this, I had only tried sushi in South Korea. In Russia it is very, very, very expensive. One piece costs at least 70 rubles, before it was two dollars, now it’s one, and in Thailand you can buy 7 pieces for 1 dollar. For 100 baht ($3) I bought 22 pieces, you can eat enough of it.
<p/>

Fortunately, the bus station is within walking distance from the center, although the direct route is along this road.

The Korat railway station is far from the center, but you can take a ticket to the Jira junction station, it is close.

<h2>Phanom Rung</h2>
<p>
On the territory of Thailand, several Khmer temples have survived from the times when Cambodia was great, and <a href="../angkor">Angkor</a> was alive. Phanom Rung Temple can be reached from Korat by bus along the main highway to the village of Ban Tako, and from there the rest of the way by motorcycle taxi (I agreed for 300 baht round trip).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256639911_1fdcf06512_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At that time, I had not yet been to Angkor, so the Khmer temples were new to me.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257386669_44ecea79ff_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Tourists are rare here; my appearance even caused a slight stir among Thai schoolchildren who came on an excursion. Entrance ticket for foreigners costs 100 baht ($3).
<p/>

<h2>Phimai</h2>
<p>
Phimai was a major city on the outskirts of the Khmer Empire, the remains of which are well preserved in the center of the modern Thai city of the same name.

When I go somewhere with a transfer in Thailand, I always leave the bus station to take a stroll and support the local economy by eating in the canteen.

<h2>Nakhon Pathom</h2>
<p>
This city, which can be considered a distant suburb of Bangkok, is home to the world's tallest stupa.

In principle, you can easily travel here in one day from Bangkok, but Nakhon Pathom is so conveniently located on the road to Kanchanaburi that I decided to stay at a hotel here.

The Phra Pathom Chedi stupa is 120 meters high.

It was built in its modern form in the mid-19th century under Rama IV and Rama V.

From the front the temple is shaped more like a Khmer one than a Thai one.

<p>
Another attraction of Nakhon Pathom is the palace of King Rama VI (1910-1925). By then, Westernization had come to Thailand, and the king was clearly a lover of European architecture.
<p/>

Here it is - Thai Sans Souci!

<p>
By the way, this is not the main building. The main palace is more modest. You can only go inside with a guided tour, which starts every 15-20 minutes in Thai.

Opposite the palace, the king erected a monument to his beloved dog.

You can walk straight from the palace to the stupa.

<p>
On the corner next to my Siam Hotel there is an excellent restaurant with a huge menu (much larger than the usual with 5-10 items). At the same time, it’s cheap there - noodles cost the same 30-40 baht, meat with mushrooms - 50.
<p/>

<h2>Kanchanaburi</h2>
<p>
Everyone goes to Kanchanaburi to see the "Bridge on the River Kwai". In 1942, the Japanese attacked Myanmar (Burma) to block the only road through the mountains that the Allies could use to supply China. To supply the occupying army in the region, the Japanese had to transport everything along a long sea route around southern Thailand and Malaysia, risking being hit by British submarines along the way. Therefore, it was decided to build a railway from Bangkok to <a href="../yangon">Mawlamyine</a>, which was a very difficult task, since it was necessary to overcome vast mountainous terrain. Construction was carried out not only by Thai and Malay voluntary-forced workers, but also by English and Australian prisoners of war, which explains the increased interest of modern tourists from these countries in this episode of history. The road was built in a year at the cost of many thousands of lives, but it stood only until 1947, and the bridge was bombed back in 1945. In 1947 it was closed as unnecessary, in 1957 the section in Thailand was brought into working order, and it is still working. The River Kwai Bridge in its current form was built after the war, and the river it crosses was renamed (Khwayai in Thai) under the influence of the book and film, while the real River Kwai (Khwanoi) is further down the road. So it goes.
<p/>

<p>
Trains rarely cross the bridge, mostly tourists walk here.
<p/>

<p>
There are many pockets on the bridge where you can hide from the train.
<p/>

I did wait for the train.

<p>
This is an ordinary Thai third class train, I have traveled on these hundreds of times. A ticket to one station across the bridge for foreigners costs 100 baht instead of the required three.

Kanchanaburi also has a chic night market. One of the richest I've seen in Thailand.

<h2>Erawan National Park</h2>
<p>
An hour's drive from Kanchanaburi there is Erawan National Park with a waterfall of the same name.
<p/>

Because of this, the paths were wet, and above about the third level they were clayey, so everything was filled with puddles.

Towards the end, you need to be creative, climb along fallen trunks and individual stones.
