<h1>Malaysia: Kota Bharu, Perhentian Islands, Penang, Alor Setar, Kangar</h1>
<i>11-26 March 2016</i>
<h2>Kota Bharu</h2>
<p>
Kota Bharu (in Malay "New City", like Novgorod or Naples) is the capital of the most conservative state of Malaysia - Kelantan. Sharia is respected here, and there are practically zero Chinese residents, although Chinese tourists boldly wear miniskirts.

<p>
There is only harsh Islamic art with suras.

On the signs, Arabic letters are larger than Latin ones.

Somewhere there are no Latin ones at all.

<p>
The store has separate cash registers for men and women. Well, just like Iran!

Kelantan is one of two states (along with neighboring Terengganu) where the residence of the Sultan is in the capital. Here is his palace with a high fence.

<h2>Perhentian Islands</h2>
<p>
Beach holiday. What could be worse? A narrow strip of sand (and in worse cases, stones), where people walk over each other’s heads, muddy salt water, and prices that are significantly inflated. From cheap Crimea to the “elite” <a href="../nice">Côte d'Azur</a>, you can spend more than 10 minutes on the beach either out of despair, or if you have never seen the sea in your life. Having spent months traveling around Southeast Asia, I mostly either avoided the resorts or took the best of them - a good selection of restaurants and entertainment, while living a kilometer from the sea and swimming in the pool. I didn’t know that it could be different: something beautiful, quiet, where you’d want to go into the sea, and not for $500 a day, like at <a href="../maldives">Maldives</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256628936_e8d0b0d34c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The Perhentian Islands are located off the east coast of Malaysia. There are two of them - Small (Kecil) and Big (Besar) Perhentian. I was only at the Small. There is more infrastructure and lower prices, on Besar one a significant part of the territory has not yet been developed, the hotels are of a higher class. On Kecil there is also the only village with a permanent population. There are no cars or motorcycles in the Perhentians; you can only move around on foot along jungle paths or by taxi boats. There are numerous boats from the mainland for 70 ringit ($17) round trip. Tourists mainly land in two places - Coral Bay and White Beach, which are located on the west and east coasts, respectively; between them you can walk in about 15 minutes through the hill in the center of the island. I stayed in a hotel in the middle between these beaches for 60 ringit ($15) per day, without air conditioning. Electricity is understandably in short supply on the islands, so rooms with air conditioning start at around $30.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255903192_2086c3928b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Both main beaches are built up with hotels and restaurants and are only suitable as a place to eat and hang out. This is Coral Bay.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257375084_ba3c1bdc09_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257375114_38dbca133b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And this is White Beach.
<p/>

<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257375204_381c4cd0dc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You can even ride a banana, just like in Crimea.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257671530_279c4d0314_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Where is it good? We go from Coral Bay to the south along the coast along this path.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257671615_31ca477440_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Well, this is much better!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255900147_d097532f17_h.jpg"/>
<p>
All that remains is to point the camera away from the three girls, and you will get a picture from an advertisement for any beach resort, where in reality this will not happen.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257671665_eaa6947776_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Unfortunately, the most important treasure of the Perhentian Islands is difficult to photograph because it is located under water - the numerous coral reefs near the shore. Here, to see something interesting underwater, you don’t need to go on a diving excursion on a ship to the open sea.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256829908_be6e357ddf_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Yes, you are in heaven!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256829923_88e9a81a81_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This was the very first beach after Coral Bay; if you go further, there will be a chain of similar secluded places.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257671675_6758daf44d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a larger beach on the south coast. There are even a couple of cafes here.
<p/>

<p>
And the hotel with 15-20 rooms.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255900282_636761cbe9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It’s also beautiful underwater here, and the beach itself looks magical.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257671735_e91e92ea78_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a village in the southeast of the island. In addition to tourism, local residents engage in fishing.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255900392_e70bd14139_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Tourists rarely come here because there is no beach, and the walk is not close - about 40 minutes through the hills.
<p/>

I note that prices in cafes here are the same as on the beaches.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257375484_2531b65605_h.jpg"/>
<p>
We walked back along the eastern coast of the island to White Beach, thereby completing a semicircle along the southern half of the island. Here, instead of a path, they are building a wider road.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255900477_ee50382488_h.jpg"/>
<p>
They even brought a bulldozer.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256629306_c4cae5f8c1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Judging by the appearance, the passage will be pedestrian, although maybe mopeds will also appear, that would be sad.
<p/>

<p>
The most heavenly and deserted beaches on Little Perhentian are located on the northern half of the island.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256629576_f1d4387785_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Firstly, north of Coral Bay, behind a couple of large hotels, there is a chain of beaches where there are very few people, no boats and coral reefs. If you don’t want to walk far or take a taxi, then this is the closest option to the hotel zone.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257375679_1c3cbdd314_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The farthest beach in this part of the island can only be reached by swimming; I couldn’t find a path. And then there is a dead end and rocks. To get to the northern end of the island, you need to find a path up the mountain at the back of White Beach and cross the hills in the center of the island.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255900767_7b167adf51_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a telecommunications tower and a platform with solar panels at the top. The Internet on the island is bad. My hotel only had Wi-Fi near the entrance, and it was incredibly slow. My U Mobile SIM card had no network connection at all in most of the island. To get the Internet in the evening I went to White Beach, where I could get 3G. And, of course, there was connection at the foot of the tower on the hill.
<p/>

<p>
When you go down the other side of the hill, you find yourself in the most heavenly and undeveloped part of the island. There is only one hotel on one beach here, and even the jungle path to the next beach is sometimes difficult to find.
<p/>

In the northeast the road ends, there is the only hotel and a view of the eastern cliffs.
<p/>

<p>
On the northwestern edge of the island is the only non-sand beach on Little Perhentian. Instead of sand there are small fragments of coral.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256631541_80bc20db44_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This beach is called Turtle Beach, but I was not lucky enough to see a turtle underwater.
<p/>

<p>
A little about food in the Perhentians. Since everything is imported by sea, prices are approximately twice as high as on the mainland. There are almost no shops, there are a couple of miserable stalls with noodles, but the choice there is very small. The main problem with fruits is that they hardly grow on the island, so they are very expensive. A dish in a restaurant costs about 10-12 ringit ($2.5-3) versus 5-6 on the mainland, but the choice is decent and the food is delicious. It is better to eat seafood.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257375494_e482db303f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a good place on White Beach with burgers for 6-9 ringit.
<p/>

<p>
In the evening it is best to come to the shore of Coral Bay. The tide floods the legs of the tables.

<h2>Penang</h2>
<p>
Penang Island (Penang in English or Pinang in Malay) is one of the most interesting places in Malaysia. This is the only region where the Chinese are the majority and there is no de facto positive discrimination of Muslims. The capital, George Town, retains British colonial architecture, complemented in recent years by the addition of famous Penang street art. Penang is also the culinary capital of Malaysia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256626191_46d470100c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
All three main types of food in Malaysia are well represented in Penang: Chinese, Indian and Malay. This is where those Indian eateries under the general name "Nasi Kandar" come from.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256827973_56ac10052b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Actually, nasi kandar with lamb:

<p>

And teh tarik tea.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257373499_7486de1343_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The most iconic Chinese dish is Char Kway Teow. Fried rice noodles in soy sauce with shrimp.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257669475_134e486b09_h.jpg"/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256827813_960a721d83_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And another signature dish is laksa. Fish soup based on curry and coconut milk, with a strange sour-spicy taste.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256827903_121fb3fb88_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The desserts "cendol" and "kacang" based on grated ice also originate from Penang.
<p/>

<p>
Opposite my hotel on Chulia Street, freshly squeezed juices were poured out in the evening for 2-3 ringit ($0.5-0.7). I liked the carambola juice most of all - better than the fruit in its raw form.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257669940_f4e18d1526_h.jpg"/>
<p>
To keep tourists from getting bored, a lot of street art has been created in various nooks and crannies of Georgetown, and there is even a special map where the paintings on the walls are marked, although, as I found out, not all of them.
