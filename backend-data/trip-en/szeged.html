<h1>Hungary: Budapest, Siofok, Szeged, Kecskemet</h1>
<i>27 November, 1-3 December 2013</i>
<h2>Budapest</h2>
<p>
I <a href="../hungary">was in Budapest a year ago</a> and didn’t think that I would return there soon, but then Wizz Air began flying to Moscow for 20 euro, and Budapest became my main European destination. Budapest greeted me with a fraudulent ATM: when withdrawing, they offer a choice of debiting in forints and dollars; if you choose dollars, then the rate is super unfavorable. At the same time, when you choose forints, he asks again, do you really want to withdraw at our fixed rate? Scam exchangers in Budapest have not gone away either, pay attention to the difference between buying and selling.

<p>
Since I spent quite a lot of time in Budapest last time, I decided not to stay in the city for long, but to immediately rush from the airport to the southern station, and from there to Siófok.

<p>
Ticket printing machines. When you buy a ticket on the website, the system reports a multi-digit number, by entering which you can (and should) print the ticket.

<p>
In the evening I walked around the city a little.
<p/>

<p>
It was pre-Christmas time again.
<p/>

<p>
I must say that the lighting in Budapest is excellent.
<p/>

<p>
Maybe it was my imagination, but there are more homeless people in the passages. Or maybe I didn’t walk through the passages enough at night last time.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255241537_769d2a2553_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In some passages there are entire rookeries of homeless people along the walls.

<p>
Goulash, very filling and inexpensive - about $10.

<p>
In the evening I took a train to Belgrade. European trains have a slightly different system of class gradations than in Russia. There is no analogue to platskart/cheapest class (where the compartments are not separated from the corridor). There is a Sleeping car and a Couchette car, both of which are coupes by our standards. Some have two levels of shelves, others have three. At the same time, there are compartments where there are shelves on both sides, and others where there are only one. In total there are compartments with 2, 3, 4 or 6 seats. When you buy a ticket, you indicate your gender, i.e. apparently men and women are not seated in the same compartment unless they are traveling together. I took the cheapest tickets for a six-seater compartment, but the train was almost empty, I was traveling alone, and there was no one in some compartments at all. An overnight transfer costs about $30, roughly similar to Russian prices.

<h2>Siófok</h2>
<p>
Siófok is one of the main resort towns near Lake Balaton. I expected to see something similar to a typical communist sanatorium resort.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256271119_7bb2a056fa_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But everything turned out better than I thought. Siófok is most similar to <a href="../kaliningrad">Svetlogorsk</a> or <a href="../latvia">Jurmala</a>, that is, is a modernized and tidied up Soviet resort.
<p/>

<p>
However, the main feature of the Hungarian province, the inscription “for sale” on every house, is preserved here.
<p/>

<p>
On the lake shore, apparently, are old sanatoriums.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254791912_9fab21a354_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The disgusting Soviet tradition of fencing off pieces of the shore for oneself is also present here. It's quite a long walk to get to the shore of the lake.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256105302_fcbb259cf4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It was the end of November, so the whole city was immersed in sleep. Even McDonalds was not working, at least I did not notice any cashiers working there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255726853_77d6b91192_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Lake Balaton itself is a common place for swimming and walking.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256566845_9d4307bfda_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The popularity is apparently due to the fact that it is not far from many neighboring countries, and everything is also very cheap.
<p/>

<p>
The railway runs along the coast. On the lake side is the resort area, on the other side there is the city itself.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254792177_dcc9377c03_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Street signs, like in Russia.

<p>
Unlike the resort area, shops were open in the city.

<p>
On the central square, <a href="../hungary2">as usual</a>, there is a memorial.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257579054_8c7b00e765_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And also a water tower.
<p/>

<h2>Szeged</h2>
<p>
Deja vu. This is the name of the feeling that I experienced when I looked at the map of the city of Szeged hanging at the bus stop and moved towards the hotel. The layout of the city is exactly the same as in <a href="../kostroma">Kostroma</a>: rays extend from the center near the river bank in different directions, and the rings have the shape of a polygon (and are not rounded, as, for example, in Moscow). There is a similar layout in <a href="../netherlands">Amsterdam</a>, where there are rings of canals instead of roads, but Szeged is more like Kostroma. I think no one would believe that this photograph was not taken in Russia:
<p/>

<p>
Kostroma mon amour.
<p/>

<p>
Here, just from the sign, it is clear that this is Hungary.

<p>
A huge number of wires, rather rare for Europe.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255585986_e88aadf5d5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The house is for sale. Don't want to buy it?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255791288_90ec13703a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Deja vu again.
<p/>

<p>
Szeged shop.

<p>
This is not France, shops are open until midnight, for which I thank the Hungarians very much.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254855912_914cca0714_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Even the full houses here are similar to the old Russian ones, although specifically in Kostroma there is a lot of diversity in this regard.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256631240_ae5c4241d3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Hungarian details emerge upon closer inspection.

<p>
For some reason the hood was covered with a grill. Is it really from theft?
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254856302_9efcd3d523_h.jpg"/>
<p>
One would expect that there would be a monument to Lenin in the center, but no.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255586096_4e8745cd14_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The center of Szeged is in some places completely different from the rest of the city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255791483_cd643f9304_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And in some places it’s quite similar.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255586156_34aa2dbc97_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is something from Amsterdam in the main cathedral.

University of Szeged. The city is considered a student city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255791613_d66224896b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It's cooler at night.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254855772_c3d59c55d6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Perhaps, of all the cities in Hungary I have been to (not counting Budapest, of course), Szeged most deserves a visit.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255586016_84848e01a3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The beautiful part is quite extensive, and there is no depressing part near it. It's a two hour drive from Budapest.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256335454_62950e9dc2_h.jpg"/>
<p>

An unusual painting was discovered in one of the arches. All the walls around are covered with memorial plaques.

<h2>Kecskemet</h2>
<p>
Hungary will not let you miss your homeland. Go to any medium-sized city and enjoy.

Why did I even go to Kecskemét? Actually in the city center the views are much more interesting.

There are contrasts between Europe and the Soviet Union, you just need to turn in the right direction.
