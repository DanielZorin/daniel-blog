<h1>Slovakia: Šturovo</h1>

<p>
For the first time I crossed the state border on foot. Slovakia in Slovak will be "Slovensko", and Slovenia - "Slovinsko". In Slovenian, respectively, “Slovacka” and “Slovenija”.

Compared to Hungary, Slovakia is a highly developed, civilized country.

Buses travel around the city. In neighboring Esztergom, where the population is three times larger, local transport has been cancelled.

The inscriptions are duplicated in Slovak and Hungarian.

Monument to Jan Sobieski (he led the troops that defeated the Turks here in 1683).

It turns out that the sponsor of the monument died in a plane crash along with Lech Kaczynski.

I had lunch for three euros, exchanged euros for forints at a favorable rate, enjoyed civilization and went back to Hungary.
