<h1>UAE: Dubai</h1>

<h2>Dubai</h2>
<p>
Thanks to Emirates airlines I got the opportunity to visit Dubai twice in transit with a free visa and hotel. If not for this, paying a minimum of 300 US dollars for a day in Dubai would be completely insane. But it’s quite normal to come to this city for one day. Once.
Like other Arab cities, Dubai is a monotonous labyrinth of low-rise gray and white cubic houses, only the streets here are absolutely empty and dull, because instead of traditional cheerful street shops, all trade is located in malls. Here is a typical panorama of Dubai:

First things first. I checked into the hotel around two in the morning and decided to go for a walk around the city. This idea was not really wrong, but rather pointless. Of course, at night everything is closed and there is no one on the streets. Rare cars beeped at me, apparently surprised that someone decided to walk along the sidewalks at night.

Without a map, I still didn’t understand where to go. Crossing multi-lane roads was problematic: crossings are only overground and are located once every kilometer at best, and you cannot cross on the ground, since there is a dividing fence in the middle of the road. The problem of maps in Dubai is very relevant: the city is much larger than it looks on Google Maps, and all the maps are not of sufficient scale to navigate by them. Since the country has no history, most streets are named, as in America, by numbers.

Later I looked at Google maps where I went, and it turned out that in almost three hours I walked around a tiny spot around the hotel. It was clear: it was impossible to walk here. So, you need to use transport. There are metro and buses in Dubai. One trip costs a little more than in Moscow, about 32 rubles ($1), and a full-day pass costs about 150 ($5). Bus stops look reassuring and solid.

Inside you can escape the heat and look at the map.

But you can’t sleep or eat, there’s a fine for that, so there are no homeless people here.

But everything turned out to be much worse than I expected. Firstly, it turned out that it was Friday, and this is a day off. And on weekends the metro opens as early as one o'clock in the afternoon. I had to go by bus. Secondly, it turned out that the buses do not run exactly according to the schedule indicated at the stop. Thirdly, you can’t buy a ticket on the bus (although for once I even had cash, which I bought with the remaining 20 dollars from Argentina). You need to buy a travel card, but they are sold only at metro stations and bus terminals. But the metro is closed, and you have to get to the terminal! Apparently, in Arab countries it is still impossible to do without a taxi. However, the prices for it here are five times lower than in Moscow, so it’s quite possible to use it.

I knew exactly where to go: the Dubai Mall. On Friday morning there you can see a completely empty food court, in which only McDonald's is open.

I walked around the mall, but didn't find anything particularly interesting. Yes, it’s big, but the point of shopping in the UAE eludes me. The prices for clothes there cannot be compared with Italy and Spain, not to mention that it’s much cheaper to fly to Italy, it’s easier to get a visa, there are cheap hotels, and in general I wouldn’t mind spending more than one day in Milan.

Toilets in Dubai Mall. Alas, they are not gold, but the most ordinary ones. Gold only in the Burj Al Arab hotel in rooms for $10,000 per day.

The UAE is a country of guest workers. They make up the vast majority of the population. This is roughly how some particularly angry residents of the province imagine Moscow: a bunch of fat, lazy Muscovites, and millions of Tajiks serving them. But in reality, even in the Moscow metro you very rarely see Tajiks, and those who travel everywhere by car probably don’t know what guests from Central Asia look like. Here, in reality, the local population is in an absolute minority. Here is a good example of an advertisement: the text is in English, Tagalog, Sinhala, Tamil, Urdu, Hindi and Bengali, but not in Arabic.

As in Moscow, guest workers here have no rights, live in slavery and receive pennies.

At this time, local residents leisurely stroll around the malls.

In Dubai there is one whole street with pretentious skyscrapers.

But if you walk around one of the buildings, the carriage will immediately turn into a pumpkin, the princess into Cinderella, and the skyscrapers into barracks.

Tourists in Dubai are exclusively Russian. This is probably explained by the fact that Europeans have a long way to fly here, while their beaches in Greece and Spain are nearby; there is no point in overpaying for a hotel and a plane. There are three and a half people on the beach - all Russians. Mostly families with small children come here; apparently, children should like local amusement parks.

The metro, which opens on Friday at 1 pm, is quite convenient and fast. Although the system with one-time tickets is not very well thought out: if you buy a ticket for a trip through 2 zones, it can then only be recharged for the same trip, but not for three zones. It is interesting that there are separate carriages for women, although their meaning is unclear, except perhaps to pander to proud feminists: in the carriage for women there was a crowd, but in the general carriage for men and women it was quite free.
