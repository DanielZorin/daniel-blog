<h1>Russia: Vologda, Belozersk, Cherepovets, Kirillov, Ferapontovo</h1>
<i>18-20 July 2014</i>
<h2>Vologda</h2>
<p>
In 2011, I was in <a href="../kostroma">Kostroma</a> and had to admit that no one pronounces the unstressed “o” there. Well, in Vologda they definitely have to speak “o”! But no, as it turned out, the speech of a resident of Vologda is no different from the speech of a resident of Moscow. Although there is still a monument to the letter O in Vologda.
<p/>

<p>
From a tourism point of view, Vologda is a very advanced city by Russian standards. There is even a tourist information center here (previously I saw it only in Moscow, St. Petersburg, <a href="../perm">Perm</a> and <a href="../sergiev-posad">Sergiev Posad</a>).
<p/>

<p>
Although it seemed to me that Vologda was away from the main tourist routes, both from Moscow and St. Petersburg it's an overnight train. At the hotel they gave me a free map of the city, just like in Europe! For some reason the map is 16+.

<p>
For some reason, the souvenir row near the local Kremlin was closed.
<p/>

Entrance to the Kremlin, by the way, is free (as in most cities)

On the river bank there is a beach with wooden sun loungers. The child built himself a house from several sunbeds.

<p>
Vologda is not a very big city. In addition, it is one of the few regional capitals that is not the largest city (the largest city in the Vologda region is Cherepovets).
<p/>

On the outskirts in a residential area, instead of streets there are numbers of microdistricts of gas processing plant.

<p>
There are all kinds of art objects in Vologda. For example, there are original benches on the river bank.

The talking bird from "Alice's adventures" (by Kir Bulychev) is distinguished by its wit and intelligence.

The graffiti shows a surprisingly realistic panorama of the city - gray boxes, factory chimneys and one temple.

Mysterious McDonald's advertisement. Firstly, it is many years old, because a cone no longer costs 6 rubles. Secondly, at that time there was no Mac in the Vologda region. Now there is already one, but not at the address "Moskovsky Prospekt".

<h2>Belozersk</h2>
<p>
Belozersk is one of the historical cities of Russia. There is a medieval fortress and quite a small population, but it is far from the level of <a href="../suzdal">Suzdal</a> because it has much fewer churches-monasteries. It’s a bit far away, even from Vologda it takes at least 3 and a half hours to drive.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256960125_99f35657de_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Belozersk is one of the most ancient cities in Russia. 1152 years - exactly the same age as Russia itself, according to generally accepted history, i.e. The first mention of Belozersk coincides with the first mention of Rurik. Actually, this is the same reference, it says that Rurik became the ruler of Novgorod, and his brothers - of Belozersk and Izborsk (although other interpretations are possible!)
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256959905_0dcf5a66fb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Inside the Kremlin there is one church and another building.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255916651_32e6ea7d9e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And lakes.
<p/>

<p>
You can climb onto the ramparts and see the surrounding area.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256960000_9af1debc2a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In Belozersk there is a monument to the victims of repression.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256665559_b2dd48e420_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is not surprising, because the famous White Sea-Baltic Canal runs near the city, right along White Lake (after which the city is named).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256960275_3451003750_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The benches on the embankment are chained. I think that if a person decided to steal a bench, he would not be too lazy to bring a file.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256665654_d532ca2120_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a beach on White Lake where residents of the Vologda region come to on weekends. We also indulged in the pleasure of swimming.

The beach opening hours are amazingly excessive.

Even Lenin stands here in a cozy corner, and not in the center of the square.
<p/>

<h2>Cherepovets</h2>
<p>
People like to add photographs of the city of Cherepovets to demotivators as a symbol of industrial trash (on a par with Norilsk). I expected to see something terrible, but I didn’t.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257054900_7cb10a2d5a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In fact, Cherepovets is a completely ordinary Russian industrial city. Well, yes, this is not <a href="../suzdal">Suzdal</a> and not <a href="../vladimir">Plyos</a>, there are factories here. And there is no special historical center for tourists; in the center there is mainly Soviet monumental art.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256759834_96d8356baf_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Maybe if you go to the Severstal plant, the main enterprise of the city, you can take photos there about the hellish blast furnaces, but on the streets it’s okay.

For some reason, the Frog Princess is very popular in Cherepovets; I saw corresponding installations in two completely different places.

As I already mentioned, Cherepovets is a center of metallurgy. The Severstal company is engaged in the improvement of the city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256759684_a129de700f_h.jpg"/>

Salaries in Cherepovets are quite modest.

Here they say "shaverma" (as in St Petersburg), not "shaurma" (as in Moscow).

There is a KFC in Cherepovets, but no McDonald's. There's Mac House.

<p>
This is how it is, not a very harsh city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255281077_1f2c6b94ba_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Kirillov</h2>
<p>
I discovered a very interesting building in the city of Kirillov. This looks like a regular commieblock. But for some reason the architects decided to decorate their creation with the year of construction, as they liked to do on buildings of the late 19th century.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257315455_40967a1088_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But of course, people don’t come here for this, but because the Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery is located here.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256965878_7013ed9c05_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Near the monastery there is a lake. By the way, Belozersk is only 40 kilometers from here, but driving directly is problematic because there is no bridge across one of the rivers, only a ferry, and public transport runs very rarely.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256473083_6a73ae36a7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
If you arrive by early bus from Vologda, it seems that this place is not very popular, but around 11 o’clock excursion groups arrive here. There are a lot of groups, it’s amazing how many groups travel around the Vologda region, although it would seem that it is quite far from Moscow and St. Petersburg. Moreover, many groups are with foreigners: they speak English, French, Italian.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256473113_45a057c3e6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a fee for photography.

The rest of the city of Kirillov.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255544692_961a9b82ca_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here there is a typical monument to Lenin, which I came across in several different cities (for example, in <a href="../sakhalin">Novosibirsk</a>).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257021654_2a1c0e8b4c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And another very atypical one.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257807415_0144f44a07_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Ferapontovo</h2>
<p>
Quite close to Kirillov is the village of Ferapontovo. The bus runs here once a day, and if you leave for Kirillov from Vologda in the morning, you won’t have time to catch it; you need to spend the night in Kirillov. The alternative is to ask to get on one of the many tourist buses, the main thing here is not miss them, otherwise they quickly leave Kirillov. Or you can hitchhike.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256094471_2b32f6e82b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Ferapontovo is a good Russian village. Not abandoned and hopeless, like 99% of other villages, but sincere and dear.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257137215_e0856506b4_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257137290_d91ac0b996_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is because the Ferapontov Monastery is located here, where frescoes from the early 16th century have been preserved. This is one of the world heritage sites in Russia.
