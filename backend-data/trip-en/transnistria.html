<h1>Transnistria: Bender, Tiraspol</h1>
<i>1-2 February 2013</i>
<p>
At the entrance to the border of Transnistria, I started the song on my player:

<i>Debout, les damnés de la terre
Debout, les forçats de la faim
La raison tonne en son cratère
C'est l'éruption de la fin
</i>

There are a lot of mutually opposing opinions about the unrecognized state of Transnistria. Some people see it as a museum of the USSR, some see it as a reserve of the nineties, some are protesting against ideological clichés. Until recently, Transnistria could be called its own country with blackjack and whores named after the eternal President Smirnov. However, in 2011, democracy came to Transnistria, Smirnov, who was running for the 125th term, lost the elections, and a new president came to power. Now the country is a crazy mix of the 80s, 90s and 2000s. Outwardly, there are a lot of Soviet artifacts, but real life here is not so different from the Russian province.

The most striking legacy of the USSR is the inscriptions in Romanian Cyrillic. We can say that in Transnistria there is a Moldovan language, since the literary norm with the Cyrillic alphabet differs from the Romanian one. Russian and Ukrainian are also official languages, so inscriptions are often written in all three.

Street names are also duplicated.

The main language is Russian, everyone communicates in it, including signs on railings.

Judging by the appearance of other inscriptions, it is immediately clear that this was painted in the USSR. It’s funny that this sign has a spelling mistake in Ukrainian: “процюе” instead of “працюе”

The inscription “House of Soviets” remains on the White House.

There is a socialist panel on the wall, and under it is an excellent restaurant with delicious food and super-low prices by Moscow standards.

The large number of exchange bureaus and advertising reminds us of the nineties.

And here are the signs of an era of stability: nostalgia for the USSR.

The inscription “Tiraspol is the capital of Transnistria”, just like in Russian cities now.

He who shall not be named is respected here. A major hotel in Tiraspol is named after him, and at the local bookstore I couldn’t resist buying a refrigerator magnet with a picture of Him and the President of Transnistria.

By the way, about hotels. For 750 rubles in Tiraspol you can stay at the excellent hotel "Aist". In the reviews on the bourgeois tripadvisor it was written that this hotel is a Soviet museum, but this is only because the authors of the review have not been to real Soviet hostels. The furnishings, of course, are not new, but the level of comfort is quite decent, except that there is no Internet. The most amazing thing is that for 750 rubles you actually get an apartment with two rooms, a bedroom and a living room. Room prices vary depending on the availability of hot water in the shower; if without it, then the room costs only 500 rubles. It is also interesting that upon check-in they do not ask for passports, and do not make you to fill out any questionnaires, which is typical for most hotels in Russia, and in many other countries.

The country has learned to live in isolation. There are many unique things here. For example, money that can only be exchanged within Transnistria. Or license plates. I wonder what countries you can enter with such plates?

They even have their own payment system, replacing Visa and Mastercard.

A kind of country that created itself to spite everyone. Two other similar countries have embassies on the main street.

On the way, I listened to Soviet Anthem, although this song is not so relevant in Transnistria.
