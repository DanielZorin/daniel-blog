<h1>Brazil: São Paulo</h1>
<i>28-30 December 2012, 18 January 2013</i>
<h2>São Paulo</h2>
<p>
I don't really like going to nature. The landscapes are monotonous and boring after a few hours, and you feel loneliness and isolation from civilization. Nowhere to go, no one to talk to. Cities, especially large ones, are another matter. Especially big ones like São Paulo. You go outside and it’s immediately clear that there is life here, and not just squirrels or elephants, that twenty million people live here, more than even in Moscow. This is best seen from a height of 160 meters.

This observation deck is located at the top of the Banespa Tower (aka Edificio Altino Arantes). In all directions, up to the horizon, only buildings are visible.

<p>
There is a cathedral not far away, also huge, like everything else in São Paulo.

<p>
The building right in the center is the tallest in São Paulo, called Mirante do Vale, it is 10 meters higher than the Banespa Tower, but it is at the foot of the hill, not at its top, so it appears lower.

<p>
The landscape looks like it was taken from a computer game. Or made from Lego bricks.

<p>
Helipads are often found on rooftops; this type of transport is popular with local oligarchs due to constant traffic jams.

While I stood in line for an hour and a half to climb to the top of the skyscraper, two girls standing right in front of me confused my black, highly spiritual conservative heart with actions that fall under Russia's law on the promotion of homosexuality. A couple of weeks earlier, same-sex marriage was even legalized in the state of São Paulo. There is no tolerance in Russia; everyone quite openly hates Caucasians, Tajiks and gays. In Europe there is false tolerance, everyone also despises blacks, Arabs and gays, but pretends to love them. In Brazil, tolerance is real. It is difficult for us, people from the Dark Middle Ages, to understand.

The tower's architect, Banespa, was clearly inspired by the Empire State Building in New York.

When viewed up close, the feeling of a city-designer does not go away.

Everything in São Paulo is huge and solid.

In general, painting on houses is popular in Brazil.

Someone considers it their duty to draw a letter under each window. In theory, these are Latin letters, but they look like “dancing men”.

They say that Moscow stands on seven hills, but I have not seen a single one. Moscow is absolutely flat, but in São Paulo the roads really go up and down, the buildings are at different levels, there are overpasses everywhere.
<p/>

<p>
Away from the center, typical low-rise buildings begin, which need to be discussed separately.

The first time I was in São Paulo was after Christmas, but before the New Year.
<p/>

<p>
The streets were crowded, everyone was shopping.
<p/>

<p>
I was amazed to the core that some vegetable traders at the market accepted bank cards for payment.

For quite a long time I hid from the pouring rain in Ibirapuera Park, watching children ride bicycles and roller skates.
<p/>

<p>
In this park, in addition to buildings designed by Niemeyer, there is a huge indoor roller skating rink.

<p>
And also an obelisk with the inscription “They lived little, but died gloriously. They died young to live forever.”
<p/>

<p>
I decided to walk from the park to the metro station, which looked closest on the map. Along the way there was a huge statue...
<p/>

<p>
...I walked, walked, walked, and eventually realized that I had made a mistake. It was impossible to cross the multi-lane road, and I was cut off from the metro line. After passing several stops, I was forced to turn aside and go to the main street - Paulista.

There are many parks in São Paulo, and they are well equipped. Traditional areas for physical exercise are located everywhere.

Advertisements for prostitutes in phone booths in São Paulo are stern and business-like.

Although if you read the text... Frankness is sometimes more impressive than in the photoshopped photos in Rio.

When I was in São Paulo for the second time, traveling from Foz do Iguaçu to Belo Horizonte, I saw an upgrade in the form of small photographs.

In the São Paulo metro there are vending machines that sell books for 150 rubles ($5).

Three weeks later, new ones appeared, accepting any banknote that you don’t mind.

My favorite restaurant. For 15.99 (240 rubles / $8) rodizio is offered: a waiter comes out of the kitchen with a skewer of fried meat, goes around everyone, gives out pieces, leaves and returns with a new skewer with a different type of meat. There was even a chicken heart shish kebab. This goes on until you are full with meat.

On the last day, in the late afternoon, I was relaxing, sitting on some porch on Paulista Street, taking photos of passersby along the way. I still have quite a lot of similar photographs from different cities.
