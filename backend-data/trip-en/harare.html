<h1>Zimbabwe: Harare</h1>
<i>1-2 February 2024</i>
<h2>Harare</h2>
<p>
It is often said that South Africa is not real Africa, it is an overly developed and civilized country. I would argue with this, since South Africa is similar to Europe only as long as you do not leave the "white" areas. But if so, then the first real Africa for me was the country of Zimbabwe. People usually come to Zimbabwe to see Victoria Falls, but I started from the capital because it was interesting to see how things work in Africa.

View of Zimbabwe from an airplane. An endless plain, and for some reason perfectly round fields.

Robert Mugabe Airport. Mugabe was the president who fought for the independence of Zimbabwe (the white minority there wanted to create apartheid similar to South Africa, but it fell in the early 1980s), and then ruled for 37 years. During his reign, Zimbabwe became famous throughout the world mainly for hyperinflation, which we will talk about a little later. In 2017, a coup took place and Mugabe was overthrown, but the cult of personality was not condemned, and now streets and the airport are named after Mugabe.

I rented a room in the cheapest hotel from booking.com, it cost $30. It’s a bit far from the center (5 kilometers), so I had to take a taxi. Taxis in Zimbabwe are also expensive, with even short trips costing $4-5 (via the Hwindi or inDrive apps). In South Africa and Zambia, taxis are twice as cheap.

Zimbabwe has a very unusual money situation. In 2008-2009, there was a legendary wave of inflation, during which banknotes reached a face value of up to 100 trillion (100,000,000,000,000) Zimbabwean dollars. After this, the local currency was abolished, and US dollars and other foreign currencies (primarily rands from South Africa) began to be used. But the influx of currency was not enough, and in 2019 the Zimbabwean dollar was returned (with new banknotes), initially the rates were 1:1, but immediately began to fall. In February 2024, the unofficial rate was either 15,000 (as it is written on the Internet), or 12,000 (as they thought in supermarkets, judging by this sign). But the largest bill is only 100 dollars, that is, Zimbabwean dollars are not particularly suitable even for small change - one US dollar is already more than a bank pack of 100 banknotes. As a result, in fact, they are not in circulation; everyone pays in American dollars or with bank cards (as I understand, local salaries are paid by bank transfer, partly in Zimbabwean and partly in American dollars). If you want to buy something cheaper than $1 (a bottle of water, for example), then there will be no change, you need to buy goods for an equal amount.

Splitting bills in Zimbabwe is not a trivial task. I went through five very large grocery stores before I found change for ten dollars. Yes, from ten, not from a hundred. And the small change is very important, both for a taxi and for small purchases. In principle, you can pay by card in stores and fast foods, but I didn’t have a card with me, and it’s scary that the bank might block it. 1 dollar bills are the most precious, it’s good that I had a lot of them left from my last trip to the USA back in 2022. I regretted that I paid $10 in bills of $1 for the Iraqi visa.
Dollars in Zimbabwe are very shabby. Below is my dollar, brought from America, above is a dollar that circulated in Zimbabwe.

<p>
On the streets, every 5 meters, there are people who top up mobile phone accounts, and they also seem to be able to do the opposite operation - cash out dollars from the account.

<p>
Some of the money changers had stacks of old Zimbabwean dollars lying around, although not the largest ones - only from 1 to 100 billion. The owner wasn't there, so I didn't find out what they were for. Near Victoria Falls, these bills are sold individually as souvenirs.

I first arrived at the bus station to buy a ticket for the next day to Lusaka. This is what the bus looks like:

<p>
Bus station in the very center of the city. The center doesn't look like a village - there are high-rise buildings, but apparently almost no one lives here, just offices and shops. Purely business area.

The central square of Harare is almost the only place where you can sit.

There is also a small pedestrian street here, although it looks unpresentable.

A man in a jacket was saying something about God in the Shona language. When I walked past and took a photo of him, she started speaking partly in English and partly in Shona.

I bought a bunch of mangoes for a dollar, there were at least two kilograms. A bunch of apples also costs a dollar.

<p>
Judging by the assortment, it is clear that this is a poor country. They fill entire shelves with identical products.

Chicken costs 5.60 per kilo, expensive. This is how much a fillet costs in Turkey.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53536199002_57f9022ae5_o.jpg" >
<p>
Fruits in the store are also expensive. The same grapes cost a dollar on the street.
<p/>

<p/>

In some stores prices are in Zimbabwean dollars. Coke for $32,999.99 ($2.75).
<p/>

<p>
Fast food prices. The combo costs $7-8. I didn’t see anything except fast foods like KFC in the center, and there was also a catastrophic lack of seats everywhere.
<p/>

<h2>Road</h2>
<p>
From Harare I took a bus to Zambia. The road took more than 10 hours - on the one hand, the guidebooks said 7, on the other hand, the distance was about 500 kilometers, plus the border. In Indonesia, buses are obviously slower.
<p/>

For some time we stood at the exit from Harare, picking up passengers. At every stop there are people selling drinks and chips.
