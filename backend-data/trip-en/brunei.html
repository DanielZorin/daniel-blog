<h1>Brunei</h1>
<i>15-17 May 2019</i>
<h2>Bandar Seri Begawan</h2>
<p>
As they say, if you sit on the bank of a river for a long time, you can see the corpse of your enemy float by. Guided by this principle, I still waited for Brunei to become visa free. Previously, obtaining a visa to this country took more than three months, and the only real opportunity to get there was with a layover of less than a day at the airport, subject to the purchase of a ticket by the local airline, whose prices are five times higher than any other. Now it’s 70 dollars round trip from Kuala Lumpur - and so I got to Brunei. I hope that if I wait a little longer, sooner or later there will be an opportunity to travel to Turkmenistan, North Korea, Saudi Arabia and Ukraine, I just need to be patient.

We are approaching Brunei. I had already seen these places from an airplane when I flew over Brunei during the trip around Malaysia in 2016.

Brunei is considered a rich country, but it doesn't look much richer than Malaysia. This is not sparkling <a href="../singapore">Singapore</a>, everything here is modest and provincial. Central street of the capital:

Museum of Royal Regalia. Here you can look at the crown, throne and numerous gifts from leaders of different countries. Unfortunately, photography is prohibited, but overall the museum is interesting.

Brunei is generally a Muslim country, but there are a lot of migrants here, so churches are common.

<p>
On the other side of the river there is a village on stilts, which I never had time to go to. But I've been to similar places in <a href="../kuala-lumpur">Malaysia</a>.

Street signs are green. The text is duplicated in Arabic letters in the Malay language.

<p>
Public transport in Brunei is quite good, perhaps even the best in Borneo. Bus travel around the city costs 1 Brunei dollar.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256163208_3b6d0e772d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The Brunei dollar is equal to the Singapore dollar, and you can even pay in Singapore dollars, although I didn’t come across any change. Prices, however, are lower than in Singapore. For example, at KFC set A costs 3.90, in Malayan ringit it is about 11.50. In Malaysia, such a set costs 8.90 ringit. So Brunei is only 25% more expensive than Malaysia, and not two to three times more expensive like Singapore.

<h2>Seria</h2>
<p>
To get a more complete picture of Brunei, I went to see other cities besides the capital. There are only six cities in Brunei, but officially there are four: Bandar Seri Begawan, Kuala Belait (southern border with Malaysia), Seria (capital of Belait district), Tutong (capital of Tutong district). Muara (location of the port and ferry terminal) and Bangar (capital of Temburong district) are officially considered villages, although they have the word "town" (Pekan) in their full name. First, let's look at Seria - the center of Brunei oil production.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257006930_878ca36734_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I get off the bus - it looks like a small Malaysian town.
<p/>

<p>
It turns out that the number 1 laundromat in the world is hidden in Seria.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256712399_a4aca5b4e2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The city is mostly low-rise, consisting of long apartment buildings like these. In the fields between them you can find oil wells.

Brunei, as a rich country, has many workers from poor countries like India and the Philippines.

I woke up early and hadn't eaten anything since the morning. However, during the month of Ramadan in Brunei (unlike Kuala Lumpur), you cannot just eat. On the one hand, many restaurants, especially fast food like KFC, are open. But you can’t eat there in the hall, you can only take it out. I didn’t want to sneak around and eat under the counter in an alley, so I took a cola and chocolate and went back to the capital to get a take-out lunch and eat at the hotel.
<p/>

<p>
It turned out that Brunei has its own branded chocolate, which is inexpensive (a huge 160 gram bar cost about $1.5) and very tasty.

<h2>Tutong</h2>
<p>
The town of Tutong is located between Seria and Bandar. I didn't stay here very long. Central square with market.

<h2>Bangar</h2>
<p>
The Temburong region is a semi-exclave of Brunei; the land connection with the rest of the territory is only through a piece of Malaysia with the city of Limbang. To travel north from Brunei to Malaysia, you will have to cross the border three times, first through Limbang and then Temburong. If you want to do it quickly, then the most convenient way is probably to get to <a href="../borneo">Labuan</a> by ferry, and from there also by ferry to Kota Kinabalu.
Temburong is also connected to the capital of Brunei by water transport, a one-way fare is 6-7 Brunei dollars, the ride takes about 40 minutes. Most of the route passes along rivers in the jungle that form a whole network of water roads.
<p/>

<p>
After leaving the capital, you can see that they are building standard neighborhoods of identical houses on stilts along the river.
