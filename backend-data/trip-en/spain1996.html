<h1>Spain: Malaga, Granada</h1>
<i>April 27 - May 4, July 6-27, 1996</i>
<p>
My first trip abroad was to Spain. More precisely, there were two trips with a short break. I was 6 years old, and we went to Andalusia - to the Malaga area. I remember that I always swam in the pool, and we went to the city beach once, but I didn't like it because the waves were too strong. Once we went on an excursion to <a href="../sevilla">Granada</a>.
