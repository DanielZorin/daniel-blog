<h1>France: Paris, Reims, Châlons-en-Champagne, Nancy, Metz</h1>
<i>9-10 April 2024</i>
<h2>Paris</h2>
<p>
I was planning to fly to Paris in the middle of the day, to walk along the boulevards, but the flight was delayed for 7 hours, and in the end I barely caught the last tram to the metro from Orly airport. The only thing that warmed me was the thought of 280 euros in compensation from the airline (which is twice the price of round-trip tickets). In the morning I immediately left for Brittany, and returned to Paris only a few days later, and only passing through.

As usual, souvenirs with the tower are sold en masse here.

From the tower you can walk to the Arc de Triomphe in about 20 minutes.

<p>
It turned out that a commuter train line (RER) runs almost under Notre Dame. Within the city limits, you can ride it with regular metro tickets (one trip has risen in price to 2.15).

<p>
I rode the train for only two stops, about 10 minutes, but at the exit the weather was completely different - rainy and cloudy. The area around is with modern architecture, I have never been here before.

<h2>Reims</h2>
<p>
Reims is the main city in the Champagne region (where champagne was invented). The city is primarily known as the place where the coronation of French monarchs took place.

<p>
At this place, at the end of the 5th century (the exact date is unknown), the first king of France, Clovis from the Merovingian dynasty, converted to Christianity.

<p>
The cathedral is epic, just a couple of hours ago I was at Notre Dame in Paris, which is much smaller in comparison.

With the exception of the cathedral, Reims is not medieval - there are straight streets, flat squares.

<p>
The high-speed train station is located on the very outskirts of the city, just like in China. But this is still not bad compared to the Lorraine station, which was made in the middle between Metz and Nancy, so that the residents of both cities would be equally inconvenient.

<h2>Châlons-en-Champagne</h2>
<p>
The official capital of the Champagne-Ardenne region was not Reims, but the much smaller city of Châlons-en-Champagne. Now this region has been united with Alsace and Lorraine into one Great East with its capital in Strasbourg.

<h2>Nancy</h2>
<p>
The city of Nancy is the historical capital of the Lorraine region. The central square is called Place Stanislas in honor of Stanislaw Leszczynski, the king of Poland, who was overthrown twice, first during the Northern War in 1709, and then after the War of the Polish Succession in 1736, after which, as a consolation, he was made Duke of Lorraine (then still independent within Holy Roman Empire), and after his death Lorraine became part of France. The ensemble of the square was built precisely in that era.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53652898621_2f9b777b72_o.jpg" >

<h2>Metz</h2>
<p>
In 1871, following the Franco-Prussian War, Germany annexed Alsace and Lorraine. In 1918, these regions returned to France, then in 1940-1945 Germany annexed them again, but not for long. In fact, Germany did not receive all of Lorraine, but only the northern part, including the city of Metz, the current capital of the region. The city with such a German name is still different from other French cities. I leave the station and it’s like I’m in Frankfurt or Dusseldorf.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53653119438_66c94c3e1f_o.jpg" >
<p>
The station itself is also German. Built just before the war, they made it specially huge so that many trains could pass straight to <s>Bakhmut</s> Verdun.
