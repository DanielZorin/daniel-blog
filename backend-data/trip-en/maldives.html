<h1>Maldives</h1>
<i>4 July 2016</i>
<p>
The Maldives is a country known primarily for its very expensive resorts. I absolutely see no point in going to them when you can go, for example, to the Perhentians in Malaysia. It has the same azure sea, coral reefs off the coast, bounty beach and seclusion (suitable for lovers). In Perhentian you can live on just $30 a day if you walk to the beach, or you can get a good hotel in Greater Perhentian for $30-40, and go to different secluded beaches by boat taxi for $5. So no matter how beautiful the Maldives is, $300-500 a day is too much. Fortunately, a few years ago the Maldives opened up to independent travel: you can go anywhere using local transport; most islands have guesthouses for $30 a day. This is quite affordable. There is a one problem though - it takes a lot of time, because cheap ferries between the islands are infrequent.
Due to time constraints, I only visited the capital Male and a few nearby islands: Villingili, Hulhule (where the airport is) and Hulhumale.

Male is a very interesting city that deserves a visit in its own right. 100 thousand people live on an island with size of two kilometers by one kilometer! It is one of the most densely populated places in the world. I wanted to say that <a href="../hong-kong">Hong Kong</a> is defeated, but in fact, one of the islands near Hong Kong just barely beats Male. In Male you cannot build forty-story skyscrapers, because then everything will go under water, so all the buildings are no higher than 5-7 floors, but the alleys are really narrow!
The Maldives start from the airport, which is located on the neighboring island to Male. Most people fly directly from the airport by plane to the resort island, or go there by boat if it’s nearby. You can get to Male by this ferry, they run around the clock and quite often, the fare is 10 rupees ($0.65).

<p>
I could not connect to Wi-Fi at the airport - the SMS with the code did not arrive to my Russian number. For the same reason, open wi-fi throughout the city did not work for me either. After passport control, there are several public computers at the airport. It's amazing that they use Ubuntu instead of Windows!
<p/>

<p>
At resorts, tourists do not see local money; they can pay for everything in dollars. I changed 10 dollars at the airport, receiving 150 Maldivian rupees (or, as they say here, rufiyaa).
<p/>

<p>
You won't get much for this money in the airport. This is the most expensive Burger King I've ever seen: the Whopper menu costs $12 (although prices in the UK are close).

I didn’t know then that this was the only opportunity to eat in Male. It was Muslim fasting month - Ramadan. The Maldives outside the resorts is a Muslim country, so all restaurants in the city were closed until sunset. In the evening they promised set dinners for $10.

Welcome to Male. You can walk around the city end to end, across and in circles several times within a day.

Maldivians come to Male for shopping and government services, so there is a high demand for rental rooms. Advertisements for apartments for rent are plastered on the walls. You might even find something for $10.

All the attractions of Male are in the northern part of the island: mosques and government buildings. Here is the main square.

One could assume that the Maldives is a rich and prosperous state, looking at how many hotels there cost 300  dollars a day, and how small the population is. But in reality this is not the case. The Maldives, of course, are richer than Sri Lanka, East Timor or the Philippines, but the history of this small country is full of troubles, victories, revolutions and betrayals. In the 1950s, the Maldives even managed to fall apart: the government decided to close the British military base on the island of Gan, in response to which the inhabitants of this island and several neighboring ones (who lived off the maintenance of this base) created the Suvadivian (South Maldives) Republic, which existed for entire five years. The head of the separatists was then exiled to the Seychelles - the islands that now also became a super-expensive resort. From 1953 to 2008, the Maldives had only three presidents, the first of whom ruled for six months, the second for 25 years, and the third for 30 years (despite several attempted military coups). In 2008, the opposition won the elections, but in 2012, as a result of the popular uprising and an armed coup, the new president was overthrown and later sent to prison. Now the President of the Maldives is this smiling man - Abdulla Yameen.

Most of the proceeds from resorts go to international corporations, but nevertheless, the Maldives are more prosperous than Sri Lanka. There are even migrant workers here who stand in line to send a money transfer home.

The Maldives has its own unique writing system. The principle is the same as in Devanagari: consonants in the center, vowels above or below.

The size of the island is approximately 500 by 500 meters. However, there is public transport here: the golf cart that drives in circles. I don’t know how much the fare is.

For five and a half rupees you can sail from Male to the island of Hulhumale. This is a completely artificial island, which is intended to become a new residential area in order to relieve the overpopulated capital. The first thing that greets me at the ferry terminal is a bus! Hulhumale is more spacious than Male, so its streets can accommodate full-size buses. Travel, as far as I understand, is free.
<p/>
