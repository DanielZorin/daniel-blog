<h1>Curaçao</h1>
<i>15-17 November 2016</i>
<p>
The island of Curaçao is a possession of the Netherlands. Its capital, Willemstad, is one of three UNESCO-listed cities in the Lesser Antilles (the other two are <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/477463.html">San Juan</a> and <a href="../barbados">Bridgetown</a>). It is a small Amsterdam, painted in acid colors.

<p>
The city consists of two parts - Punda ("center") and Otrabanda ("other shore").

They are connected by a pedestrian bridge.

<p>
Sometimes the bridge is moved to the side to allow ships to pass. Free ferries operate during this time.

In the distance there is a bridge for cars, high enough to fit a cruise ship.

I wanted to get there, but there was a pack of very unfriendly dogs on the way, so I had to retreat.

There are a couple of smaller bridges in Punda.

This one is similar to <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/227757.html">Jakarta</a>.

The island of Curacao is quite popular among by tourists; the central streets and squares are well-kept.

In the meantime, paint is crumbling on the streets further away.

Even in the city, the sea on Curaçao is very attractive. Unfortunately, I had neither the time nor the opportunity to snorkel on remote beaches; they say there are many fish and corals there.

Otrabanda is less polished, but no less cute.

There are two forts at the mouth of the river.

In Otrabanda the fort has been turned into a souvenir shop, and in Punda there are administrative buildings inside.

The official language of Curaçao is called Papiamento. It is a mixture of several languages, primarily Dutch, Spanish and Portuguese. The first time I heard this language was on the plane flying to Curaçao (I was flying with the local airline Insel Air), and I couldn’t understand: the words seemed to be similar to Spanish, but with a Portuguese accent (u instead of o, reduction, etc.) . Shoes = sapatu (sounds the same in Portuguese).

Stima Korsou i tene limpi - I guess this can be translated as "Respect Curacao and keep it clean". In Spanish estimado = respected (English has a similar word esteem), limpio = pure, tener = to hold.

Curaçao uses the same florin-guilders as Sint Maarten. You can pay in dollars too.

<p>
Prices at a local cafe. To get dollars, you need to divide by 1.8. As you can see, the prices are not very high; much cheaper than in the Netherlands, although, of course, much more expensive than Malaysia.

Until 2011, all Dutch colonies except Aruba were one administrative unit, but now Aruba, Curacao and Sint Maarten have equal status with very broad autonomy.

I rented a room in Curacao through airbnb for only $10. It was in the central part of the island, but next to the bus route to Willemstad.

In the center of the island there are thickets of cacti everywhere.

Just outside the capital there is a huge oil refinery near the lake.
