<h1>Portugal: Evora, Elvas, Faro, Sintra, Lisbon</h1>
<i>30 September - 4 October 2014</i>
<h2>Evora</h2>
<p>
Évora is located far from the sea in a maritime country. All houses in the city are painted white and pale yellow.
<p/>

<p>
Black and yellow paving stones were found in only one place!
<p/>

<p>
The houses are gracefully built into an aqueduct that has stood since Roman times.

<p>
There is a hostel in one of approximately the same small houses in the back streets. There were no other guests there, so I photographed the antique interior.

A Roman temple on the outskirts of the Roman Empire has been preserved in Évora.

<p>
Although Évora is a small town, and even many shops are closed here on Sunday, the political struggle does not cease here either. "Since 2001, Portugal has lost 500,000 young people. We want to work, not emigrate! The government is screwed!"
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257134290_dffdc2ecfa_h.jpg"/>
<p>
"The people are robbed and dying of hunger." I didn't notice that.
<p/>

<p>
"When I grow up, I'll go to university to become cultured and listen to good music."
<p/>

<p>
Street signs in Évora are unlike any other city.

Strange gargoyle statues are attached to one of the local churches.

The Seventh-day Adventist Church, as usual, in an unremarkable house.

<h2>Estremoz</h2>
<p>
On the way to Elvas, the bus passes Estremoz Castle.
<p/>

<p>
Near the town there is a quarry where it looks like they quarry the stone that goes into the paving.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257133620_ed0d983571_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Elvas</h2>
<p>
I didn't go to this remote area in vain - I found another hidden pearl of Portugal, and indeed of the whole of Europe. Meet the city of Elvas.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256836974_09b0263535_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Elvas is located 10 kilometers from the border with Spain. In the old days there were many wars between Portugal and Spain, so no expense was spared in building walls around the hill where Elvas stands.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255359177_a8f99278b5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The current star-shaped outer walls have been built since the 17th century.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946307624_0680ad102f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The walls are on several levels, each level has its own gate. There are only two entrances to the city through gates (one of them, in this photo, is for cars), in another place the entrance was made at a later time.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256088796_7df5defd22_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Most of the fortifications are climbable, although one corner is fenced off for a military base and museum.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256089141_37a9174eec_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are also forts on the neighboring hills.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255358782_79ec8b34f4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On the other side of the top there is a steep cliff.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257131985_e6f86c8e65_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256288888_f7a5a64505_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And this is the very first level of fortifications, dating back to the 12th century.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255358857_2aa5d7bb99_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The intermediate walls are so densely covered with houses that they can only be traced through a few towers.
<p/>

<p>
Also in Elvas there is an aqueduct of four levels.
<p/>

<p>
The population is only 20 thousand.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255358742_34514dce75_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The coloring of the houses is in some places the same as in Évora.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257782905_c736e8f578_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In some places it's just white.

In the evenings there is almost no one on the streets.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256837424_8cd04a7668_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Only the students in robes continued to have fun. They forced freshmen to their knees as part of a rite of passage.
<p/>

<h2>Sintra</h2>
<p>
I’ve already been to Sintra, but it’s always nice to take another walk, especially when the train costs 2 euros.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946027456_f7585287d9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Sintra has a couple of streets with souvenirs and many palaces around.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256564505_2596de30b3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In addition to the palace museums, there are many private villas with fences built around them.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255724413_0fdb7d329f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
To get to the two main palaces you either have to walk a long way up the hill or take a bus, which is not very cheap.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255519771_631ac592e3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In principle, you can get into the Pena Palace without a ticket, through the fence.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256269094_6dcde205dc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I limited myself to photographing the park, although it is not difficult to climb over.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256564675_35d6d275cb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You can go down not only along the main road, but also along a goat path like this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257875005_331e217fa6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Then you can go straight to the most beautiful place in Sintra - the Regaleira Palace.
<p/>

We took a walk, now we can go to the station.

<h2>Faro</h2>
<p>
I spent a long time deciding whether it was worth going from Lisbon for one day to Faro (45 euros round trip), but in the end I decided to go for the sake of completeness. In general, the south of Portugal is the least interesting part; it is built up mainly with resort villages. Faro is almost the only city worthy of attention in the region.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256092016_c05bb80884_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Faro is not a resort, although there is a sea here (a deep and winding bay). There is a railway along the beach.
<p/>

<p>
Promenade.
<p/>

<p>
Boat parking is impressive, however.

So old that trees sprout in it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255361842_612b729507_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Inside the wall the city is very small, essentially one square and a couple of alleys. Most life is behind the wall.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256291738_3ff68fa483_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Back street.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256291918_932beceb9e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Almost the entire center is pedestrian.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256092111_d17484cc37_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The peculiarity of Faro is that here in the paving stones, in addition to yellow and black ones, there are also red stones.
<p/>

<p>
Of all the cities in Portugal where I have been, Faro is perhaps the most unkempt.
<p/>

But this graffiti is beyond competition.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256840019_4a1ad0c74d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Faro has excellent street signs. Each has a drawing in accordance with who the street is named after, as in <a href="../madrid1">Madrid</a>.
<p/>

In Portugal, it is not houses that are numbered, but entrances.

<h2>Lisbon</h2>
<p>
If an ordinary Portuguese city stands on a hill, then Lisbon, due to its size, is on seven hills, so the number of observation platforms here breaks all records.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257113369_3268d8e087_h.jpg"/>
<p>
You take an elevator or tram and get a good view.

It has the highest concentration of black and yellow tiles in the country. They are even at train stations.

In practice, this means that almost all migrants from former colonies in Africa settle here.

<p>
In Lisbon, marijuana dealers stand on every corner and offer their goods to passers-by. Portugal is one of the most liberal countries in Europe in this regard. Alcohol lovers also have where to spend money, for example, a tavern where cherry liqueur is poured. There's always a queue.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256046987_f1d1c316be_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Lisbon probably has the most boring street signs in all of Portugal. Similar to Barcelona ones.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256367186_ee46b443b2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is enough beauty here even without signs.

Portugal is a country of nostalgia. Here, more than anywhere else, they love to remember the epic past, and they adore everything vintage and authentic. It's no surprise that there is a store in Lisbon that sells items from brands from when our grandmothers were young.

It's funny that I've been to Lisbon twice, but I didn't take the trams, only the metro. I walked everywhere in the center.
