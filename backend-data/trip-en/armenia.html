<h1>Armenia: Yerevan, Ethcmiadzin, Garni, Geghard, Noyemberyan, Sevan, Goris, Gyumri</h1>
<i>3-6 May 2014</i>
<h2>Noyemberyan-Sevan</h2>
<p>
Before arriving in Armenia, we had not actually been to the mountains; they were only visible on the horizon during the trip through <a href="../chechnya">Grozny and Derbent</a>. Almost immediately after crossing the border of Armenia, <a href="../lugano">Switzerland</a> begins.
<p/>

<p>
The first stop is in a town called Noyemberyan.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256579904_9c493c3b3d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It was so steep here that we specially stopped the car driving back so we could go out at the pass to take photos.
<p/>

<p>
If in Russia the church stands in the center of the village, then in Armenia they like to put the church on some mountain away from houses. This also applies to most large monasteries (Noravank, Tatev, Geghard).
<p/>

<p>
Let's move on.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256033408_593041ce9c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
From the border with Georgia (Sadakhlo-Bagratashen, the most popular crossing) to Yerevan you can go in two ways - through Vanadzor or through Dilijan. The second road is a little longer, but incredibly beautiful.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255102012_01930f1a0e_h.jpg"/>

<p>
The quality of roads in Armenia is mediocre; in Russia, the main roads are usually better.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256874890_106e66c89e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Below this road through the pass is the village of Voskepar (Askipara), which in Soviet times was an exclave of the Azerbaijan SSR in Armenia. During the Karabakh War, all such small enclaves were actually annexed to Armenia (and one Armenian exclave came under the control of Azerbaijan).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256580109_6b4d4a9cab_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In these places, the road de jure crosses the border of Armenia and Azerbaijan several times.
<p/>

<p>
The road to the left of the lake is formally Armenia, actually Azerbaijan.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256033723_c754ade9aa_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Both roads to Yerevan connect near Lake Sevan. There is a third road from Vanadzor not through Sevan, but Google does not recommend it.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256875205_c473d06d54_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Sevan.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256875175_aa74cea2fe_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Another church far from the city is the Sevanavank Monastery.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256033818_1c1669c35c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here the road turns to the city of Sevan and further to Yerevan.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256875285_ad4b67436d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
As you approach Yerevan, huge mountains become visible.
<p/>

<p>
And at this wonderful moment we are entering the capital of Armenia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256580574_34f18a054c_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Yerevan</h2>
<p>
The capital of Armenia lags somewhat behind Tbilisi and Baku in terms of modernization. In general, Yerevan is the most Soviet of the three Transcaucasian capitals, perhaps because there is no money here from oil or grants. On the first day we lived in a residential area, which is officially called Nor-Nork, but in everyday life it is called “Massive”.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256806490_d1c0d43849_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But in good weather you can see Ararat from the window.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255965378_6ffc38bf5b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And here on the horizon are the mountains in the area of Lake Sevan.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255965398_d76d72b28c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the center they have prepared one ideally European street.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255033062_624f4988e5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The more typical architecture is easily recognizable.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255762821_e00ae16cfb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are also surprises; this city hall building seems to have come here from <a href="../washington">America</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256511679_d265f6ac6a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In Yerevan they like to erect monuments against the backdrop of columns.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256807105_052d9822d4_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255965493_7493d15c96_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are many areas with slums in Yerevan, more than in Tbilisi and Baku.
<p/>

<p>
Old artifacts are preserved in the corners.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255033187_1b8371cc06_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The bus station certainly hasn't changed for a long time.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255033347_f83d516480_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256511369_db6a43171d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In Armenia there is Tax free, like in Europe. I have never seen anything like this anywhere else.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256511384_89c526d974_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Russian brands are present.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256806640_20ac256150_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Parking in the center is paid. It costs only about 9 rubles per hour ($0.30).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256862121_a9701d5261_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Metro station. There is only one metro line in Yerevan (Baku and Tbilisi have two each) and it is not particularly functional. Tokens have been preserved here, while in Tbilisi and Baku only smart cards are used.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255762196_d0b28399d0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Near the main attraction of Yerevan - "Cascade" - there are many objects of modern art. I saw this statue in <a href="../madrid1">Madrid</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256806925_739e910f81_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The Love Monument is in <a href="../new-york">New York</a> and <a href="../washington">Philadelphia</a>. And statues of a man hugging his knees stand in the central square of <a href="../nice">Nice</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256511849_cd2f677152_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I saw a design made from tires (though another one - a dinosaur) in <a href="../milan">Genoa</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255762681_0984e0a33c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Ararat and Yerevan are clearly visible from the Cascade.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256807025_d251b7850a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
TV tower and numerous slums on the surrounding hills.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255033572_ccf82fdbe3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
For food, I recommend the restaurant chain "Karas", they have national cuisine and are very cheap. This dinner for two cost about 500 rubles ($15), despite the fact that there were about 5 dishes.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256807130_fb026c15ca_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In general, it’s not boring in Yerevan.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256807155_3b7a98758a_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Etchmiadzin</h2>
<p>
Armenians are very proud that Armenia was the first country to adopt Christianity. I visited two of the most famous monasteries located in close proximity to Yerevan. The first one is called Etchmiadzin.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255353337_aa4481d3a7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The city in which it is located was also previously called Etchmiadzin, but in 1992 it received its older name Vagharshapat.
<p/>

<p>
There are churches here from the 5th-6th centuries.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257126715_677ff89b87_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Everything is built from typical Armenian bricks of different shades of brown.

<p>
The Armenian Church is not Orthodox, unlike the Georgian one, since it separated from other churches much earlier. The image style here is unique.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257126560_43b2a80273_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257126675_c24bbdc2b7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Armenians also have crosses that are unusual for us.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257485624_0dbd0eef22_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Garni and Geghard</h2>
<p>
The second famous monastery is located in the mountains.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256864669_4e2a396671_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256116821_5750751d7d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It is called Geghard. The spear of Longinus was kept here (hello Hideaki Anno!), or rather one of three: there is another one in the Vatican and one in Vienna. Now the spear is kept in the Etchmiadzin Museum.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257159615_510a8d5178_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A spear is attached to the cross.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257159570_22cf4697c5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Inside this monastery is a very dark, ominous place.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255386817_d629de197f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the semi-darkness you can hear the sounds of a stream flowing across the floor.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256744181_c356a2dec5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The light barely breaks through from above.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256864814_060baf22f7_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256864754_71ed8feabd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And crosses are everywhere in huge quantities. No less than on the <a href="../lithuania">Hill of crosses</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255386872_70a1865616_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Nearby is the town of Garni, famous for the fact that a pagan Armenian temple has been preserved there, i.e. a temple built before the adoption of Christianity in the 3rd century.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255386922_7e4b58077e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But the main thing is not the temple itself, but what is around it.

<h2>Goris</h2>
<p>
The second big hitchhiking in Armenia was from Yerevan to Goris (and further to the border). Beautiful weather, and for the first hour and a half the road overlooks Ararat. Then the road turns into the mountains and goes entirely along serpentines, so that the distance from Yerevan to Stepanakert, nominally equal to 300 kilometers, is covered in a total of six hours.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255102737_e8b613f06d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Typical Armenian village. This one is called Areni.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256034053_ff2e3079ec_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Not far from here in the mountains is the famous Noravank monastery, but it’s not in the photo yet.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256875510_3e6b9864e8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The road from Areni passes through these places.

The next mini-stop is the village of Gorayk. Even in the village you can see typical Armenian buildings made of different shades of brown brick.

Finally we are in Goris. Goris is located in a valley, the shape of the city is long and narrow, and the road goes around its edge like a serpentine.

One more pass - and we descend into the valley to the border of Armenia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256034978_3dc5f005c9_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Gyumri</h2>
<p>
I decided to try a new genre: imagine that I am Artemy Lebedev and photograph the city from the car window. As it turned out, you can shoot quite a lot, although a better camera is desirable so that it focuses quickly. So, we are entering the city of Gyumri, the second largest city in Armenia. It used to be called Leninakan (and some people in Armenia still use this name in everyday life), and was almost completely destroyed by an earthquake in 1988.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257202710_80379072f7_h.jpg"/>

<p>
Since then, houses of more than 3-4 floors have not been built here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256358823_10ae583913_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Gyumri is famous in Armenia for its beer "Gyumri", the logo of which (similar to the logo of the London Underground) hangs everywhere.

For the Internet, they still use the IE logo, not Chrome.
