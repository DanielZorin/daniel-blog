<h1>Guam</h1>
<i>18-19 June 2019</i>
<p>
The plane is approaching the island of Guam. Geographically it is part of the Mariana Islands, but politically it is a separate unincorporated US territory. Like Saipan, Russian citizens can enter without a visa. Guam has been under US rule for a long time - it was annexed immediately after the Spanish-American War of 1898, after which it remained American throughout the entire period, except for the Japanese occupation of 1941-1944. While Saipan is a tourist village, Guam is a more important place, with large US air and naval bases.

In the foreground, a piece of the Navy base came into the frame. Judging by the map it's a shopping district. The military area is, of course, closed to public.

So, Guam. Welcome in the languages ​​of all major tourist groups. At a glance, Guam is dominated by Japanese and Korean tourists, with few Chinese. The cheapest way to get to Guam is from Korea, with flights from many cities starting at $130.
<p/>

<p>
Taxi is very expensive - almost 3 dollars per kilometer. I booked a hotel near the airport and walked 2 kilometers to it. The cheapest room on Guam is $60, there are no hostels. Interestingly, expensive hotels in Guam are slightly (10-15 percent) cheaper than in Saipan, apparently due to competition. Saipan has only Hyatt from the well-known chains, but Guam has everything. Hyatt in Guam and Saipan for the same dates cost $243 and $286, respectively.
<p/>

The airport is quite large.

<p>
Guam has three times the population of Saipan, and you can feel it right away. The highway has three lanes in each direction, and trucks rush along it. I wonder what can be transported in such volumes around the small island?

Bus. These shuttles, as well as LeaLea shuttles, travel along several routes in the tourist area of ​​Guam, connecting hotels, two large malls (GPO and Micronesia Mall), and some also go to Hagåtna, the capital of the island. Travel is not cheap - $4, or $12 per day. There are also government buses, which I will explain later.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256896664_26404aec14_o.jpg">

These shuttles run frequently, every 15 minutes along the beach, for longer routes every 30 minutes.

Beach. For such a major beach with expensive hotels, it’s somehow undignified to have so much mud and seaweed.

On my second day in Guam, I explored the central and southern part of the island. First I walked to the capital (about 5 kilometers).

Hagåtna is the capital of Guam. Previously called Agaña (under the Spaniards) or Agana (under the Americans). Recently renamed to a name from the local Chamorro language.

Regarding state public transport in Guam. The central station is located in Hagåtna, there are routes both to the tourist area and to the south of the island. The frequency is disappointing - once every 2-3 hours. The fare is low, however - to get to the south of the island I paid $1.50, and for short distances people paid $0.50. In the foreground, by the way, is also a bus in the shape of a car. The locals use the buses; at the bus stop they tried to beg me for spare change a couple of times, just like in the USA.
