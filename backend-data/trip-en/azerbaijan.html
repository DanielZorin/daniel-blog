<h1>Azerbaijan: Baku, Gobustan, Ganja</h1>
<i>28 April - 1 May 2014</i>
<h2>Baku</h2>
<p>
By default, you expect from Baku all the typical shortcomings of cities in the post-Soviet area. Since I arrived by car and settled on the outskirts, I first saw the back side of Baku, which will be discussed later. When you go outside at the central metro station, your jaw smoothly moves down.
<p/>

<p>
The Azerbaijanis managed to transform a fairly large area in the city center into Europe. Apparently, the style is based on <a href="../paris">Paris</a>.
<p/>

Magic trick: here houses are covered with special sand-colored slabs.
<p/>

Here's a closer look at the street sign in the background.
<p/>

<p>
Sometimes the signs are made in the same style.

<p>
Some buildings, of course, were there before. For example, the building on the right is the city hall; it can be seen on pre-revolutionary postcards.

<p>
But most of the city before Europeanization looked completely different from what it does now.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256063068_67b6148793_o.jpg">
<p>
Something like the local Central Department Store, left over from Soviet times.

What tiles!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256611114_9e3150c3d4_o.jpg">
<p>
What paving stones, similar in color to the paving stones in Portugal, <a href="../rio-de-janeiro">Brazil</a> and <a href="../macau">Macau</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256064328_d2c7f3c669_o.jpg">

What benches!
<p/>

Here the streets are washed with a hose.

The subway passages shine with fresh marble.

What an embankment! Europe, category A.

<p>
Although not entirely, out of nowhere come stupid absolutely useless inappropriate fences.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255861801_929dfe490d_o.jpg">
<p>
Just like in Moscow.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256063423_535bfdb6a0_o.jpg">
<p>
However, this was the only mistake of the embankment architects.

<p>
If Soviet times, films about Europe were shot in <a href="../latvia">Riga</a> and Lviv, and Baku was used for settings of the east. The closest analogues on the territory of the USSR are <a href="../uzbekistan">Bukhara</a> and, with a stretch, <a href="../chechnya">Derbent</a>.

From some tablets you can also find out that the Azerbaijani language used to have a writing system based on the Cyrillic alphabet.
<p/>

There are still traces of a past life.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255862826_425cdb681b_o.jpg">
<p>
But from a distance they are no longer visible.
<p/>

<p>
Let's look at Baku from above (from the top of the Maiden Tower, the most famous landmark of Baku).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256611709_1754141d87_o.jpg">
<p>
Only sand-colored new buildings are visible on the horizon.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255134232_cba93e98be_o.jpg">
<p>
From the hill where the flame towers stand, the view is similar: the entire coastline is being actively developed. In the center you can see the Maiden Tower.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256905075_9672d3ca68_o.jpg">
<p>
The towers are, of course, the office of the oil company. You can go upstairs for free using the funicular.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256714846_2ca1dd49e2_o.jpg">
<p>
On the other side there is a pier and a huge Azerbaijani flag.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255862196_7b895e61dc_o.jpg">
<p>
The streets around the center are being improved gradually. For example, the hospital building was restored. Here the shape has hardly changed, it’s easy to imagine what it looked like originally.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255986252_54997fa1e8_o.jpg">
<p>
Pathos and epicness reign in Baku.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256064453_44ce5f5662_o.jpg">
<p>
The largest and most beautiful KFC restaurant in the world was built here.
<p/>

<p>
In fact, this is an old station building, and the new one is next door.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255986352_299b6d9b99_o.jpg">
<p>
The bus station is enormous, you can get lost.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255861291_e12cc7f461_o.jpg">
<p>
From the inside, however, it looks like a huge clothing market.
<p/>

For perfection, taxi cars from London were ordered here, painted purple instead of black.

<p>
Those who are not rich can take a bus, the fare costs about $0.30. At the stops they hung very cool boards with touch screens where you can study the routes.

<p>
And now about the price. All this brilliance is available primarily to wealthy people; the majority of the population of Russia and Azerbaijan does not fall into this category. Azerbaijan is the most expensive place in all the territories of the former USSR, more expensive than Moscow and <a href="../sakhalin">Sakhalin</a>.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255986302_8bb5e8b971_o.jpg">

<p>
Azerbaijan is the first absolute monarchy on the territory of the late Soviet Union. Power is unlimited and is passed on from father to son. This was not achieved even in Turkmenistan, where the son of the Turkmenbashi betrayed his homeland and emigrated to Russia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255134042_fd2186a4ab_o.jpg">
<p>
The current president, before his father’s death, was not very active in politics, so there were assumptions that he would be a nominal ruler, but Ilham Aliyev turned out to be no timid person and quickly took all the power for himself.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256610129_7efa4208cb_o.jpg">
<p>
It was under Ilham that the personality cult of Heydar Aliyev reached unprecedented heights. The peculiarity of this cult is that Azerbaijanis do not limit themselves to installing monuments at home, but strive to erect them all over the world, causing bewilderment among local residents.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255133727_ed1da561b9_o.jpg">
<p>
Heydar Aliyev successfully replaced Lenin in Azerbaijan. His statements are already being quoted everywhere. To educate the people, quotes are placed at the entrance to each underground passage.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256063973_ddcb34e2cd_o.jpg">
<p>
The son is not far behind and is saving up his own collection of quotes.

Of course, at the entrance to the school, a statement from you know who.
<p/>

Inside the school... well, you get the idea.

With all this, the dictatorship in Azerbaijan does not look scary. While in <a href="../uzbekistan">Tashkent</a> I felt like I was in 1937 (despite the fact that there is not a single portrait of the president there), Azerbaijan rather reminded of a comical Latin American republic from the book “Kings and Cabbages”. It's hard to take it seriously when the president is addressed as "His Excellency."
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255132352_348570a906_o.jpg">
<p>
Even taxi drivers in Azerbaijan are not afraid to openly admit that all oil revenues go primarily to enrich the royal family. Considering how much oil per capita there is in Azerbaijan, the average salary even in Baku does not exceed about 25,000 rubles ($800). For comparison, the global price standard, a Big Mac at McDonald's, costs 150 rubles in Azerbaijan versus 90 in Russia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256905650_4073050a91_o.jpg">
<p>
So people leave Azerbaijan to work in Russia for a reason.

Let's see how ordinary Baku residents live.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255862771_64dee91625_o.jpg">
<p>
There are two million people in Baku, a significant part of which still lives not in the beautiful center and new buildings, but in houses like this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255863341_23a73c03aa_o.jpg">
<p>
Being on the outskirts, you wouldn’t think that somewhere here the Soviet influence has already been cleared out.
<p/>

<p>
The renovated houses in the center have not improved much on the inside either. If you look into the yard, you can see the following.
<p/>

As in any self-respecting southern city, everyone adds as many balconies and attics as they can.
<p/>

Well, now it’s time to look at the real slums, or as they say here, mahallas.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256064523_84aa430e69_o.jpg">
<p>
It is in the place of mahallas that multi-storey new buildings appear. So, the mountain on which the flame-tongued skyscrapers stand was previously built up with slums, now some are built up, but some are not yet, just leveled. Authentic slums can be seen if you climb the mountain where the Baku TV tower stands.
<p/>

<h2>Gobustan</h2>
<p>
Not far from Baku there is the Gobustan nature reserve, famous for its mud volcanoes and rock paintings. You can get there by local bus, but it’s easier to go by intercity bus. To do this, you need to stand at the exit from the bus station and get on any bus that goes south, for example, to the city of Lankaran. For one and a half manats you can get to the town of Gobustan. To go back it’s easy to catch a local bus to Baku for 60 kopecks, since there is only one. The bus arrives at the outskirts, from which you can take any bus to the center for 20 kopecks.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257717835_0450557a65_o.jpg">
<p>
In general, this is far from the only place in Azerbaijan where there are mud volcanoes, but it is the most famous and easily accessible.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256675321_15d2c7c8c1_o.jpg">
<p>
You can only get to the volcanoes themselves by taxi, the standard price is 25 manats (if you don’t bargain, they’ll ask for 30), but thanks to Alena’s talents we managed to negotiate for 20.
<p/>

There are not very many tourists, so it is almost impossible to find travel companions on the spot. There was also a group of Chinese, but they arrived in their own minibus.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257421619_311ff5ae92_o.jpg">
<p>
The liquid is not at all viscous, similar to ordinary muddy water.

The leaking liquid mixes with the clay and hardens. Figures can be sculpted from pieces of clay lying around the perimeter of the volcano.

<h2>Ganja</h2>
<p>
Ganja is the second largest city in Azerbaijan. Oil money still flows here, but foreign tourists usually do not, so here you can look at life without excessive gloss.
<p/>

The first thing that catches your eye is that here you can find Soviet artifacts that were carefully cleaned out in Baku.

In general, Ganja is not a very 'eastern' city; it looks more like a Russian province. Previously, by the way, it was called Elisavetpol and Kirovabad.
