<h1>Turkey: Diyarbakir, Şanlıurfa, Mount Nemrut, Kahta, Adiyaman, Harran, Gaziantep</h1>
<i>25-29 July 2022</i>
<h2>Diyarbakir</h2>
<p>
Diyarbakir is the largest city in Turkey with a predominantly Kurdish population. Because of this, it became the center of an interethnic conflict, the last round of which was not so long ago - in 2016. Then there was a real war going on here, the city center behind the ancient fortress walls was under siege for several months and was subjected to artillery shelling, as a result of this a significant part of it was destroyed, and now the city is being rebuilt almost anew. It seems that this is the first time I have found myself in a city where the war was so recent.

<p>
Diyarbakir has direct flights from Antalya twice a day, making it a convenient starting point for a trip to the southeast. I arrived in the evening already dark, but walked around the city.

<p>
Diyarbakir, of course, is not a night city at all, almost everything is closed, there are restaurants in only one patch. There is little lighting, even taking photographs is problematic because of this.

Let's see the city during the day. First of all, to the citadel, located in the northeast of the old city.
<p/>

The fortress walls of Diyarbakir, as well as the Hevsel gardens located behind them, are included in the UNESCO list.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52252365190_10bb3503aa_h.jpg"/>
<p>
These gardens have been here for several thousand years, and they still grow something there.
<p/>

<p/>

<p>
A river is visible between the gardens - this is the Tigris River (Dicle in Turkish), one of the two rivers of Mesopotamia - the interfluve of the Tigris and Euphrates, where ancient civilizations arose.
<p/>

It is claimed that the wall around Diyarbakir is the second longest wall in the world, after <a href="../dongbei">The Great Wall of China</a>.

The entire eastern half of the old city was leveled after the events of 2016. If you go inside the walls, you will see something like this:

Goat Tower. Near it are the southern gates of the city (my hotel and, in general, the busiest spot are at the northern gate, as well as the Ataturk monument; at night I also walked to the western gate).

<p>
New buildings in the historical center are built in the same style with standard, non-flashy signs. All stores have such signs, including chain supermarkets, which generally each have their own corporate identity.

<p>
Kurds even look different from Turks, not to mention their language, which is from a completely different family (Kurdish is related to Farsi). It is surprising that for a long time the Turkish authorities officially even denied the existence of the Kurds, calling them “mountain” or “eastern” Turks.

<p>
The old districts in the center of Diyarbakir survive mainly in the middle and west (the entire east and southwest have been demolished, and the northwest is more commercial).

Their desolation is striking - not complete, but still the feeling that there are fewer people here than there would be if everything was populated.

<h2>Şanlıurfa</h2>
<p>
Şanlıurfa (or simply Urfa) is one of the oldest and most colorful cities in Turkey. It is a rare city where the historical center has been more or less preserved, where there is an atmosphere of the magical East.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52250873192_3d50ad3a31_h.jpg"/>

<p>

About 20 kilometers from Şanlıurfa there is one of the World Heritage Sites - Göbekli Tepe. I got there in the same rented car as to Nemrut; there is no public transport there.

<h2>Mount Nemrut</h2>
<p>
Of the most famous places in Turkey, Mount Nemrut is probably the most difficult to get to. It's at least 10 kilometers from a place where minibuses theoretically go once an hour, I am not sure if there is a taxi available there at all. And even to the nearest major city buses from neighboring cities go literally a couple of times a day. I considered it justified to spend money on renting a car, which, thanks to the increased level of my knowledge of the Turkish language, I managed to do in Sanliurfa for 1000 liras (not without a problem - many rental companies do not allow driving to the neighboring region, and not everyone has cars with an automatic transmission).
<p/>

<p>
The first 50 kilometers were along the highway to Diyarbakir.

On the horizon is the city of Siverek, where you need to turn onto a smaller road to Mount Nemrut.

At this point, the Euphrates turns into the huge Atatürk Reservoir (the third largest body of water in Turkey) due to a dam built downstream.

The village of Karadut is the last settlement before Mount Nemrut. Minibuses seem to go to Narince along the highway every hour (along the Siverek - Kahta route), but if they go here, it’s rare.

<h2>Harran</h2>
<p>
Harran is a small town near the border with Syria, famous for its beehive-shaped mud houses.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52252142194_b8b3ab5996_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The structure of the city is unusual - in the middle there is a huge wasteland where there once was an ancient city, to the south of it there is an old district with beehive houses, and to the west there is a modern city. In the south there are still ruins of a castle that were closed to the public.

It's quite cool inside (by the standards of this hot desert region). The rooms from which there is no exit to the street (in the second row) are quite dark, since the light only comes from the window in the ceiling and small side windows.

<h2>Gaziantep</h2>
<p>
Gaziantep is one of the largest cities in Turkey, located in the southeast near Aleppo in Syria. Originally called simply Antep (Aintab), it was renamed "Veteran Antep" after the Turkish War of Independence due to its long resistance to intervention.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52252145224_550fd4e1b5_h.jpg"/>

<p>
In the center of the city there is a castle on a hill.

<p>
Inside the castle there is an exhibition with bas-reliefs describing the events of the war. Antep was under siege by French troops for almost a year, from April 1920 to February 1921. It held the enemy forces for a long time, allowing the army to be used on other sectors of the front. In the text comments it was mentioned several times that local Armenians were on the side of the French, but somehow modestly it was not indicated why.
