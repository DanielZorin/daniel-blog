<h1>Ireland: Killarney, Limerick, Galway, Sligo</h1>
<i>27-30 August 2019</i>
<h2>Killarney</h2>
<p>
Killarney is the most tourist town in Ireland, much like <a href="../laos">Vang Vieng</a> in Laos - a small town where there are much fewer local residents than there are hotel rooms. The center consists almost entirely of bars and souvenir shops.

<h2>Ring of Kerry</h2>
<p>
In my opinion, there is nothing to do in Killarney unless you like to hang out in a souvenir shop all day. Therefore, the main reason to be here is trips to the southwestern coast of Ireland: the Dingle Peninsula and the Iveragh Peninsula. Iveragh is a fairly large peninsula, and the road along the coast circles, starting and ending in Killarney, the capital of County Kerry, which is why the route is called the "Ring of Kerry".
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257313505_04e9a5ba45_o.jpg">

<p>
The road is for the most part quite narrow, with one lane in each direction. It is recommended to drive counterclockwise by car, because buses travel in the opposite direction, clockwise. The bus tour is surprisingly cheap, only 20 euros.
<p/>

Well, at least there is a promenade along the sea and a rocky beach. It’s cold even in August, but it’s beautiful, of course.

After Sneem there is a fork in the road: you can go back to Killarney along the larger road along the coast, or along the smaller but shorter one through the pass. This is the most picturesque part of the Ring of Kerry.

<h2>Limerick</h2>
<p>
You can get from Killarney to Galway with one change in the city of Limerick, after which the genre of humorous five-line poems is named.

The stone commemorates the Treaty of Limerick in 1691, which ended the civil war in which King James II tried to regain the throne of England (from which he had been deposed in 1688), by relying on Ireland (and previously Scotland).

<h2>Galway</h2>
<p>
Galway is the fourth largest city in Ireland after Dublin, Cork and Limerick. There is a lot of tourism here, like Killarney, but there are also a lot of ordinary people and students who come to study at university. The center is very lively.

<h2>Cliffs of Moher</h2>
<p>
Galway is primarily the gateway to visit the Cliffs of Moher. In principle, you can get there from Dublin in one day, but then the journey will take more than three hours one way, and from Galway you can still see a lot of interesting things along the way.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255384697_f40dcaaa48_o.jpg">

<p>
The area south of Galway is called the Burren. Here you can often find such an unusual landscape - fields covered with what look like stone slabs.
<p/>

It is located at the most popular place where the cliffs reach their maximum height - more than 200 meters.
<p/>

<p>
It’s interesting that the official path here is laid as much as 5 meters from the edge (on the left you can see how it is fenced off with stone slabs), so if you walk along it, you can’t see anything at all.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255384707_c453b489f6_o.jpg">

The well-trodden paths confirm that almost everyone does not walk behind the fence.

There are quite a lot of people in the summer, but, as in all other attractions in the world, 90% of them are concentrated in 10% of the area near the entrance, the further you go, the freer it is around.

The cliffs stretch south for another 8 kilometers, gradually decreasing. Unfortunately, I didn’t have time to go that far, so I only got to the first big turn.

View in the opposite direction - there are just fields there. If you look from there, you won’t guess that there is a cliff 200 meters high beyond the edge.

<h2>Sligo</h2>
<p>
Initially, after Galway, I thought of going to Northern Ireland by the fastest route - through Dublin, where transport runs every hour. But then I figured that there was nothing stopping me from driving along the west coast and spending the night in Londonderry, and so I would see more of Northern Ireland, and at the same time I would also visit the north-west of the republic. Only one change - in the city of Sligo.

In general, this is an ordinary provincial center, like others, it has its own classic Irish churches, pubs and so on. There aren’t many tourists, but that’s not a big deal, life is in full swing as it is.
