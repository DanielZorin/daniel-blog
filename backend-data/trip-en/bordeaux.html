<h1>France: La Rochelle, Saintes, Cognac, Angoulême, Bordeaux, Saint-Émilion</h1>
<i>7-9 April 2024</i>
<h2>La Rochelle</h2>
<p>
La Rochelle immediately brings back memories of the novel "The Three Musketeers", where the heroes took part in the assault on this city in 1628. At that time, La Rochelle was the capital of the Huguenots (French Protestants).
<p/>

<p>
The station is epic.

<p>
La Rochelle is a coastal city with a large port with a narrow harbor in the center.

<p>
All my life I was sure that oysters looked something like this. At least that’s how they were depicted in children’s books, with a pearl between the wings. It turned out that these were scallops.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53652904251_2aa4b265c5_o.jpg" >
<p>
And oysters look like this:
<p/>

<p>
The cheapest cost 4-5 euros per kilo, regular ones cost 10 euros.

<h2>Saintes</h2>
<p>
In this city I just had a long transfer between trains, but in France almost any city is worthy of a walk. Saintes literally means "saints", but in fact the name comes from the ancient Roman Santonum, which was so named after the Gaulish tribe that lived here.
<p/>

From the station to the historical center it is quite far for a small town, about a kilometer. But it’s already beautiful here, especially this neat row of trees.

It turned out that the founder of this brand was Irish (but moved to France to serve in the army at the age of 19, this was in the 18th century). That's why the brand name doesn't sound French.

<h2>Bordeaux</h2>

Bordeaux is the capital of the Aquitaine region and the city is quite large. It has an extensive historical center, built in a neoclassical style, which visually distinguishes it from other French cities.

In the summer, everything here is filled with water so that there is a reflection.

In the background stands a monument to the Girondins.
<p/>

<p>
During the French Revolution, the Girondins were a group of deputies in the convention, together with the Montagnards they formed the Jacobin Club, which strongly advocated for the republic. Then a conflict arose between the two groups of Jacobins, as a result of which Robespierre and his Montagnards won, the Girondins were executed, and from this moment a period of great revolutionary terror began.

<p>
Why is this monument here? The Gironde is the department (a unit smaller than the region) in which Bordeaux is located.

In Bordeaux, I was able to find a cheap restaurant (by French standards), which is clearly visible from its occupancy.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53653156638_1b1e9e0de2_o.jpg" >
<p>
Here dishes cost 10-12 euros, and snacks generally cost around 5.

Beef Burgundy (Bœuf Bourgignon), one of the classic French dishes. This meat, stewed in wine, turns out very tender. There is a similar dish with chicken - coq au vin ("Rooster in wine"), but I was never able to find it, very few places serve it.

<h2>Saint-Émilion</h2>
<p>
The municipality of Saint-Émilion is included in the World Heritage List. This is a rare village that is easily accessible by public transport: it’s only 30 minutes from Bordeaux by direct train, and trains run quite often, since this line popular.
<p/>
