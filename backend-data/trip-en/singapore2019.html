<h2>Singapore</h2>
<p>
On the way to Australia I had a rather long layover in Singapore, about 7 hours. I took advantage of the visa-free access to the city during transit and went for a little walk around Singapore.

I wanted to get by without cash, but it turned out that I wouldn’t be able to leave the airport that way: you can only buy a metro ticket with cash. This is what always happens with me when trying to switch to cashless transactions.

There is an advertisement for One Piece in the carriage.

First, I went to the downtown. At the exit from the metro, on one side there is just a vacant lot, an area for future development.

On the other side, it is built up.

The advertisement encourages you to register your scooters.

I found myself under this famous hotel.

From there I decided to go to the gardens and the giant trees. Last time I was there only at night, but not during the day.

A shopping center area where I spent some time.

Now I complete the circle in the center past government buildings.

Finally, I caught a glimpse of the laser show.

Little did I know then that due to the flight delay I would have to spend the whole night at the airport and sleep under a bench in the corner. Fortunately, the Singapore airport has comfortable carpets on the floor, and there is a cheap food court, where, by the way, cashless payment was also not available at night.
