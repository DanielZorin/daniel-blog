<h1>Nepal: Birganj, Pokhara, Annapurna, Kathmandu</h1>
<i>14-28 May 2017</i>
<h2>Birganj</h2>
<p>
The border of India and Nepal is not as contrasting as the borders of <a href="../ivangorod">Russia and Estonia</a>, <a href="../yucatan">USA and Mexico</a> or <a href="../yangon">Thailand and Myanmar</a>. But still there are many differences. For starters, the Nepalese city is much cleaner than the neighboring Indian one (although still dirty).
<p/>

<p>
There are no horse-drawn carts here, but there are many tuk-tuks of a slightly different model than in India.
<p/>

<p>
However, this may be explained by the fact that Birganj is a rather large city compared to the Indian Raxaul.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256970530_75db01733e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is even some nice architecture.

<p>
Nepal was not a British colony, but there is a clock tower here too.

<p>
Civilization is present here - you can buy a SIM card (I doubt that a SIM card would be easily sold to a foreigner in a small Indian city). There are more restaurants than in India.

<p>
I wanted to go to Kathmandu, but due to election day, entry into the city was closed that day, and I didn’t really want to spend the night in Birganj, so I took a ticket for an overnight bus directly to Pokhara. There was a section of about 50 kilometers on the highway where there was essentially no road, but the rest was more or less okay. I thought it would be worse.
<p/>

<h2>Pokhara</h2>
<p>
Pokhara is the starting point for Annapurna treks. Here you can relax cheaply before and after the trek - I rented a room for 5 dollars close to the center, but it can be cheaper if not so close. Among the attractions in Pokhara there is a lake.
<p/>

<p/>

<p>
And mountains around.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257399384_8afd865fd8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Close to the lake there are a huge number of restaurants and shops for tourists. There you can buy souvenirs, hiking equipment, and cashmere scarves.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257399464_187bb87691_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Restaurants on the main street are not cheap. Even at KFC (yes, they have it!) pieces cost two dollars, much more expensive than in Russia (to convert rupees to dollars, you can divide by 100).
<p/>

<p>
But 10 minutes from the embankment near my hotel you could eat cheaply for a dollar.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256652791_6ac653c664_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Or you could have steaks for 5.
<p/>

<p>
Or local vodka "Ruslan". I don't know how much it costs.

<p>
The assortment of any stall in Pokhara is larger than in the largest shopping center in Delhi. You can almost buy Parmesan cheese there, not to mention panty liners.
<p/>

<p>
Architecturally, Pokhara consists of small, simple houses.

<h2>Annapurna</h2>
<p>
Nepal is famous primarily for trekking in the mountains. The region around Mount Annapurna is the most popular because it can be reached by bus in a few hours from Kathmandu, while the second most popular region - around Everest - requires a flight (or  10 days on foot). The main trek around Annapurna with one pass higher than 5000 meters takes 2-3 weeks. Unfortunately, I didn’t have that much time, so I only walked along the initial sections of this trek, up to a maximum altitude of only 3200 meters.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255823156_0f0a5389a7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Entrance to the track costs $40 - 20 for a ticket and another 20 for a booklet, which is stamped at checkpoints in certain places along the way. Hiking in Nepal is not what we are used to in Russia, with tents and a backpack full of canned food that will last for two weeks. Here the entire path actually passes through a populated area, from one village to another (except for the small highest section of the full track, which goes at an altitude of more than 4500 meters, where a person physically cannot stay for a long time without a supply of oxygen). In every village there are modest hotels where you can buy food. The higher, the more expensive, but in general you can spend 10-15 dollars per day per person. Travel agencies can organize all this much more expensively by assigning a guide and porter to you. The meaning of the guide is not particularly clear; it is difficult to get lost there even with a paper map, because there is essentially one road, with only a few global forks. In most places, even the Internet can be reached. A porter can be helpful if you are not very fit. I left most of my luggage at the hotel in Pokhara, so I was almost light.
<p/>

<p>
The beginning of the trek is in the village of Nayapul, you can get there by public bus from Pokhara for a couple of dollars.

Most of the road goes through the valleys of various mountain rivers.

<p>
The next village is called Birethanti. From here there are two paths - to Ghandruk and to Tikhedunga-Ulleri, ultimately they both go to Ghorepani, from where the road goes up to the pass or to the base camp.

On the slopes of the mountains there are rice terraces, familiar from other countries of South and Southeast Asia.

A road is either a path or a staircase.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255094087_72628b1903_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Typically, the first place to spend the night is Tikhedunga, but this is too easy: the whole road is flat, I reached it in about 3 hours at most. Therefore, I set my sights on spending the night in the next village of Ulleri.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255094137_14b2a98963_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255094167_cc1d3fedfb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Ulleri is nominally not far away - 4 kilometers, but there is a steep climb up the stairs, the first one on the way.
<p/>

<p>
Local residents use mules to lift heavy objects such as building materials; small groups of these animals are constantly found on the stairs.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256572219_2977dba97b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The ascent to Ulleri is 300-400 meters high; Tikhedunga seems shallow and distant from here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256025908_78eb1db708_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Entrance to Ulleri. I was very tired and stopped for the night at the first hotel along the way. A hotel room costs anywhere from $1 to $5 a day, usually just beds and very thick blankets (it's really cold at night).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255094362_041a9a3138_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Hotels receive their main income from food, which is why the cost of a room is so low. Prices are the same everywhere, set by the local tourism committee.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255823851_4f27c93931_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is what the menu looks like.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256572289_ffd685327c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Let me remind you that 100 rupees = 1 US dollar.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255823926_97b31a9ac2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
As you can see, prices are significantly higher than in Pokhara, but you can easily eat rice/noodles with chicken/vegetables for 3-5 dollars. For drinks, I usually took milk or ginger tea (less than a dollar). Beer fans will have to fork out as much as $5, although I don’t understand why you need beer when hiking in the mountains.

<p>
The goal of the second day was to get to Ghorepani and the Poon Hill with a height of 3200. First we had to go through Ulleri, which turned out to be a very long village with a considerable climb from edge to edge.

<p>
A bottle of cola was used to replace a section of hose. By the way, about water. In the villages there are pumps everywhere, where water, as I understand it, comes from mountain rivers. I drank it without problems, although many people buy bottled water.

<p>
After Ulleri there is a fairly large uninhabited area of ​​about 10 kilometers, in fact all the way to Ghorepani.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256026243_fbbb4cab07_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Forest. There are no particular views along most of the route, the path is through the forest. It was also cloudy and definitely smelled like rain, so I walked as quickly as possible.

And finally, the entrance to Ghorepani.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255094812_e0cb792e9e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
As soon as I checked in at the checkpoint, it started to rain.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256867775_df04122970_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It was raining like this, it was impossible to get out from under the canopy for almost an hour.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255824331_f1ae4be85f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Once the rain stopped, I walked the last couple of hundred meters to the top of Ghorepani and checked into a hotel. Meanwhile, the rain had stopped, the blanket was warm, and there was still an hour and a half left before sunset.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255094942_be9e88356d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This meant we could go to Poon Hill.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255824431_52355f4805_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The standard route involves spending the night in Ghorepani and going up the hill in the morning to watch the sunrise. But why is dawn better than sunset? But no one went to sunset, not even the controllers who sell entry tickets in the morning. There was no one at all on the entire hill.
<p/>

This day was the most difficult: although the highest point was passed, the road here went up and down through several valleys and passes.

At the end there was the most difficult section - you had to go down 200 meters into the valley, and then immediately climb 200 meters up.

Since I was ahead of schedule, on the fourth day I planned to cover the remaining distance, fortunately the road was almost all downhill, although more than 20 kilometers. In the morning, as usual, it was sunny, and Annapurna was again visible from the window.

<h2>Kathmandu</h2>
<p>
Kathmandu is the only truly big city in Nepal; it is a huge multi-million agglomeration. Contrary to expectations, Kathmandu turned out to be quite a colorful and interesting place, better than most cities in India. Even despite the consequences of the powerful earthquake that destroyed the city in 2015.
<p/>

The central square has been partially restored, but even in this state the scale is visible.

In general, in Nepal, tickets are treated carelessly. For example, if you go up the side stairs to this famous Swayambhu temple, you won't encounter the ticket office.

There is an area in Kathmandu where many tourists live - Thamel, north of the central square. Thamel is full of hotels, decent shops and restaurants.

You can rent a room for 5 dollars or even cheaper if you bother searching. The most noticeable disadvantage of Kathmandu is the very poor water supply. This is the only city in the world where I was hesitant to even brush my teeth with tap water, let alone drink it.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257297110_29ac16bffa_h.jpg"/>

It is also terribly dusty in Kathmandu, especially on the wider streets (the ring road is pictured in the photo). All the dust flies down into the valley here.

Public transport in Kathmandu consists of large buses that travel along the ring road and other highways, and small public tuk-tuks, as in the photo. The routes of small tuk-tuks are difficult to understand, but going around the circle road is not difficult, and most of the attractions are within walking distance from it.

There is a former royal palace nearby. The monarchy in Nepal was abolished in 2008. In 2001, the heir to the throne staged a Columbine in the palace, killing his father, the king, and his entire family, and then shot himself. His uncle, who had previously been king in early childhood in 1951, became king. The monarchy was abolished because it was one of the conditions for ending the civil war and peace with the Maoist rebels who controlled large parts of the country.
