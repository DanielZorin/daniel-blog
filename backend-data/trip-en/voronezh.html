<h1>Russia: Voronezh</h1>
<i>18-19 November 2020</i>
<h2>Voronezh</h2>
<p>
I was in Voronezh back in 2005, but I had no photographs or special knowledge about the city itself (I was there for the school Olympiad). You can get to Voronezh by fast train in 6 hours or fly by Pobeda plane for 1000 rubles. This is a fairly large city, about 10 years ago it cleverly broke into the honorable category with a population of more than a million due to the expansion of the city limits. As in other cities of the Black Earth Region, the historical center was almost completely destroyed during the War, so now in Voronezh there is a triumph of the Stalinist Empire style.

<p>
Modern Voronezh is one of the most uncomfortable cities in Russia, similar to Chelyabinsk or Volgograd. Most of the streets in the center have 5  lanes, cars drive along them at high speed, there are very few pedestrian crossings, you need to constantly make detours. Unlike Chelyabinsk, there is no “Arbat” here. Well, more precisely, there is, but it’s kind of empty.

There in the middle there is a strange disproportionate monument to Vladimir Vysotsky.

The life is along the main street - Revolution Avenue. At night it is beautifully illuminated.

The central square with the Lenin monument is completely empty, not only are there no benches, there is not even a traffic light - you have to cross six lanes along an uncontrolled crossing.

<p>
Not far from here, near a factory, there is a unique picture: two monuments to Lenin in one frame (this used to happen only in sculpture parks and museums, and not on ordinary city streets). One on the left stands at the entrance, the second on the right behind the fence.

<p>
Voronezh is located on the hills, thanks to this, firstly, a significant part of the center consists of the private housing, and not of high-rise buildings, as in other cities: on the hills it is simply not very possible to build high-rise buildings according to a template. Secondly, in the city you can find observation platforms with good views, such as on Victory Square.

And here there are stairs instead of streets.
<p/>

<p>
There is no direct access for cars.

Below the bank of the Voronezh River is Admiralteyskaya Square.
<p/>

<p>
This is a large historical square, but somewhat isolated from the rest of the city due to its location: even buses don’t actually run here (once an hour).

At this point, the Voronezh River expands, forming a reservoir.

<p>
The Voronezh River flows into the Don, which flows into the Sea of ​​Azov. Therefore, here Peter I founded the first admiralty to build ships for the war with Turkey. A reconstruction of the first ship, the Goto Predestination, is moored near the square.

<p>
Therefore, in Voronezh, far from the sea, paintings on marine themes are often found.

On Admiralteyskaya Square there is a legendary landmark of Voronezh - a toilet in the form of a fairy-tale castle.

A visit to Voronezh would be incomplete without a trip to the other side of the Voronezh Reservoir, glorified by the Sektor Gaza group in the song of the same name. Sektor Gaza is the Russian name of the Gaza Strip, and also sounds like "The sector of gas", and this district got this unofficial name because of the air pollution. The song's chorus started like "Sektor Gaza - you won't survive until 40! Sektor Gaza - put on your gas mask!" Since 1992, the chances of living to forty in this area have increased significantly, since, unlike the Soviet era, factories at least minimally monitor harmful emissions. The industrial complex was built immediately after the war, so aesthetically the area looks good - there are many classic cultural centers and decent residential buildings (at least in the central part).

It is found in different areas, here even the style of the 24 hours inscription was copied from McDonald's. Usually such establishments are found in the Caucasus, or at least in cities where there is no real Mac, but in Voronezh there is one.

The fairly large residential northern part of Voronezh is cut off from the center by railway. In addition to residential neighborhoods, there are many institutes and some attractions there, so I traveled there quite a bit. Just behind the railway station there are wooden houses.

In low-rise areas, you can often find structures like these made from mailboxes; they look abandoned - probably now everyone has their own mailbox hanging on the fence.

Public transport in Voronezh is not that bad. Here, alas, the trams were demolished a long time ago, but at least there are no minibuses here; at least you can get on the local buses without bending over backwards.
