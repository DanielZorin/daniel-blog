<h1>Cameroon: Douala, Limbe, Yaounde</h1>
<i>31 July - 3 August 2024</i>
<h2>Douala</h2>
<p>
Cameroon is probably the most exotic country in Africa I've been to so far. Tourists rarely come here, there's little information. I was generally afraid to go to Africa, thinking that the infrastructure would be bad there - for example, a couple of very expensive and bad hotels for the whole city, almost no restaurants - like it was, for example, in India, only worse. In fact, I haven't found such bad countries yet. Cameroon is quite an advanced country, there are a lot of hotels, restaurants, supermarkets. I'll start with the city of Douala - it's not the capital, but the largest city and the main airport.

<p>
The first thing that catches your eye: the tropics! This is not a highland plateau, like in East Africa, and not a savannah, like in the south. It's hot and humid here, like in Southeast Asia. Cameroon is located approximately on the equator.
<p/>

<p>
Because of the humidity, all the buildings here have this black mold, like in Thailand.

It rained a lot. Motorcycle taxis here drive with long umbrellas.

<p>
Douala is a big city, and there are many things here, but no urbanism. Most of the sidewalks are occupied by cars, if they are not occupied - there will be a minefield over the sewer.
<p/>

<p>
The city has a small historical center. In the main square there is a monument to the First World War.

I took the classic - "ndole". This mass consists mainly of the leaves of the ndole plant, which grows in central Africa, it's a little bitter. Meat is added to it. On the sides is "miondo", which is fermented cassava, a nice thing. Cameroonian food is the most unusual stuff I've tried in Africa.

Cameroonian money is Central African francs (they are also valid in several neighboring countries). There are big problems with change, coins and even 500-franc notes are often not available, even in large stores.

Paul Biya, the President of Cameroon, greets you at the airport. He is famous for having ruled for almost 50 years, since 1975. Only the King of Sweden and the Sultan of Brunei have ruled longer than him, and Biya is the first among presidents. Although the President of neighboring Equatorial Guinea, Teodoro Mbasogo, can argue with this. Biya was Prime Minister from 1975 to 1982, and only became president in 1982. Mbasogo became president a month earlier. In third place (excluding monarchs) is the President of Uganda, who has ruled since 1986.

Douala Airport. I spent the whole day there on departure, as the flight was delayed for 8 hours. The airport is terrible, you can’t buy anything to eat there at all, you even have to go through passport control to go to the toilet.

<h2>Limbe</h2>
<p>
There is an English speaking region in Cameroon along the border with Nigeria. In the 19th century, Cameroon was a German colony, and after 1918 it was divided between Britain and France. Britain got a narrow strip that was governed from Nigeria. After independence, part of British Cameroon joined Nigeria, and part (closer to the sea) joined Cameroon. But there is still a low intensity conflict over independence/extended autonomy for the English-speaking region, and it is not recommended to travel to most of it. However, the southernmost part, near Douala, seems to be OK, so I found a shared taxi and went to the city of Limbe.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945083737_25b7b18273_h.jpg" >
<p>
The drive from Douala to Limbe is 70 kilometers, but the journey took about two hours, there were some checkpoints, stops, and just bad sections of the road.

There is one place where there is a sort of checkpoint, and all cars slow down. Approximately on the border of the English-speaking region. There is a very lively trade along the road.

I ordered the "eru" dish with "kanda". Kanda are these balls made of cowhide. You can't really chew them, only like gum. And "eru" is a boiled herb of the same name with spices, in which the balls are located. It's cool, although a bit bitter for my taste. But very unusual. On the right is the Cameroonian side dish - "garri", a porridge made from cassava root.

<h2>Yaounde</h2>
<p>
Yaounde is the capital of Cameroon. It is located closer to the center of the country on the Cameroonian plateau, so it is not as hot here as in Douala. The city is large and hilly.

<h2>Train ride</h2>
<p>
There are passenger trains in Cameroon. Every day, a fast train in the morning goes from Douala to Yaounde, and returns in the afternoon. There is another slow train, and one night train from Yaounde further north to Ngaoundere. I wanted to go from Douala in the morning, but I couldn’t get a ticket before departure. In the end, I went by bus, and then back by train.
