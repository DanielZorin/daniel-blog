<h1>Guatemala: Flores, Tikal, Livingston, Guatemala City, Antigua, Panajachel</h1>
<i>19-22 October 2021</i>
<h2>Flores</h2>
<p>
Crossing the border, I found myself in Guatemala, a Spanish-speaking country. The border town is called Melchor de Mencos after a Guatemalan army commander.

<p>
The city is quite large and lively, there are a lot of shops with colorful signs, just like in other Latin American countries.

The landscapes of northern Guatemala look like this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51735724656_d21a72c0b6_o.jpg">
<p>
The main city of this region is called Flores. The Peten region occupies almost half of Guatemala, but is sparsely populated, since it is completely jungle (and the rest of Guatemala is mountains and hills).
<p/>

<p>
The drive to Flores is more than 100 kilometers. When we drove past the airport, I was surprised by the level of civilization - a modern shopping center, McDonald's. I thought that Guatemala would be an unmodern poor country, but it has its own islands of prosperity.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51735734686_d85934642c_o.jpg">
<p>
Although those are just islands, the vast majority of local cities look like this:
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51735733921_84ea5f1fbe_o.jpg">
<p>
Suddenly, there are tuk-tuks driving here, like in India and Thailand.

<p/>

<p>
The city of Flores is unusual in that its center is located on a small island in the middle of the lake.
<p/>

There is a similar city in Germany - <a href="../augsburg">Lindau</a>.

Although the island is small, it has a full-fledged hill, so the streets of the old city are photogenic.

<h2>Tikal</h2>
<p>
In northern Guatemala lies Tikal, one of the most famous abandoned ancient cities in the world. It was a little over an hour’s drive from Flores; by the time I got there, the weather had changed dramatically, and instead of heat it began to rain. I bought a full-body raincoat at the entrance and went inside.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51735734201_573a0bc971_o.jpg">

<p>
From the entrance it’s another 15 minutes walk to the first pyramids.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51736379829_1d2b003382_o.jpg">
<p>
It was so flooded that I had to jump over the roots.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51735734501_8f4ab49f2a_o.jpg">
<p>
There was a python lying right on the path. The place, apparently, is wild - there are no populated areas nearby.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51734908727_91ae7b68bc_o.jpg">
<p>
Finally, I reached the main square of the ancient city, and at the same time the rain almost stopped.

In the center you can see altars on the ground where modern Mayans make sacrifices.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51735968348_804a7e1658_o.jpg">
<p>
Then you can walk around other parts of the city. Essentially this is a forest in which you periodically come across all sorts of buildings.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51736622220_dccf84f941_o.jpg">
<p>
The panorama from the largest pyramid on the outskirts is indicative - you can see the main pyramid from the central square, and the endless forest.
<p/>

<p>
It is impossible to take a full-length photograph of this pyramid itself, because the top is not visible from below.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51734908592_c667d2bdcb_o.jpg">
<p>
There is still a third pyramid nearby that you can climb (the place is called the “lost world” / Mundo perdido).

<p>
There were very few tourists - besides the fact that there are generally few of them due to the coronavirus, most most likely arrive in the morning, and I was almost before closing. In fact, someone could only be found near three pyramids that could be climbed. In all other places I walked completely alone, like Indiana Jones.

<h2>Livingston</h2>
<p>
After 4 hours of travel from Flores, I got off in the city of Rio Dulce at the beginning of the river of the same name. The "Sweet River" flows from Lake Izabal and into the Caribbean Sea.

Instead of speed bumps, ropes are used, as in Indonesia.

Twice a day, motor boats depart from the pier under the bridge and travel the entire length of the Rio Dulce River.
<p/>

We arrive in the city of Livingston. This is a city on the Caribbean Sea, accessible only by water. Ferries from Rio Dulce run only twice a day. From the larger city of Puerto Barrios also on the coast they depart as they fill up.
<p/>

<p>
Livingston is named after the American lawyer Edward Livingston, whose work formed the basis of the legislation of independent Guatemala. He should not be confused with David Livingstone, the African explorer for whom there is a city in Zambia. They are spelled slightly differently - Livingston and Livingstone.

I wanted to leave immediately for the capital, but it turned out that the last bus had left two hours ago, and the next one would be late in the evening with the expectation of arriving in the morning. I didn’t want to travel on a bus at night, so I bought a ticket for the first bus in the morning and rented a hotel room near the bus station. It would've been better to go by bus - I would have definitely slept better than in this room, where, as it turned out, there is an invasion of giant cockroaches at night.
<p/>

In the morning I left towards the capital. At the entrance to the bus they searched through bags and pockets in search of weapons, I had never seen anything like this.

<p>
The road to the capital goes uphill, rising to a height of more than 1 kilometer, so it is no longer hot there.

Instead of 5 hours, the bus traveled for 8 hours, standing for an hour and a half in a traffic jam on the highway due to cars involved in an accident, which for some reason did not want to move to the side.

<h2>Guatemala City</h2>
<p>
The capital of Guatemala is called Guatemala. Formally Ciudad de Guatemala, and colloquially Guate (the same is written on the windshield of buses). This city is firmly among the top most dangerous cities in the world, so I didn’t have the desire to explore it in detail. And due to the fact that the road took longer than I thought, there was very little time, and I decided not to risk it and see only the center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51735731856_b9fc78a2e4_o.jpg">

<p>
In general, Guatemala is a city of over a million people, there are many districts that are named by numbers, there are several expensive and rich ones, where everyone is behind fences, and everything else that is visible from the window while you are driving around the city.
<p/>

<h2>Antigua</h2>
<p>
The most touristic city in Guatemala is Antigua - the colonial capital. It was destroyed several times by earthquakes, after which the capital was moved to the current city of Guatemala, and this became “Old Guatemala.”
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51736389274_8a15eb71f8_o.jpg">

<p>
Today's Antigua is similar to other Spanish colonial cities in Mexico or South America.
