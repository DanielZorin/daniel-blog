<h1>Slovenia: Piran, Koper, Ljubljana</h1>
<i>19-21 July 2014</i>
<h2>Hitchhiking</h2>
<p>
So, Slovenia, the country that I wanted to get to for so long, and didn’t know how. The situation was not very good: in Hungary the road was of local importance, but right after the border there is a toll highway on which you cannot stand. The highway is a continuation of the Hungarian highway, coming from Budapest itself, and not far from the border it divides into two roads: to Croatia and Slovenia, and this border crossing is sort of a side one. However, it is a good 15 kilometers to walk to the town of Lendava, where the main highway begins. In fact, at this border (in the photo in the distance you can see the empty customs terminal that operated in pre-Schengen times) there is a whole truck stop. However, only an hour later we were picked up by a Slovak truck driver who was traveling to Spain through Slovenia, Italy and France. I started to get used to speaking a mixture of words from different Slavic languages, mainly Russian and Polish, which I know better.

<p>
In Europe, unlike Russia, truckers do not use walkie-talkies to inform each other of the situation on the road, since here it is not customary for the police to set up ambushes. The truck is equipped with a laptop with a map of Europe, some kind of special one, not Google Maps. There is also a system installed there that forces the driver to stop on a parking lot every N hours to sleep for 45 minutes; we don’t have that either.
<p/>

<p>
In Slovenia, as in Hungary, you cannot stand on the motorway. However, here on the highway there are often pockets for an emergency stop, while in Hungary, on the roads that I saw, essentially everywhere there was a shoulder the width of a full-fledged lane.
<p/>

<p>
In Hungary and Slovenia, when entering a toll road, you do not need to pay directly at the toll booth, unlike most countries. You need to buy a special sticker on your windshield, called "Vignette" in French, which gives you the right to drive on toll roads for a certain period of time. The exit to the toll road is indicated by a sign with the image of this very vignette. However, this does not apply to trucks; there is a special lane for them at the entrance to the highway. The driver has a special card that he touches to the reader. You can also refill it at the booth.

On the right side is the city of Maribor, which I have never visited.

<p>
In Slovenia, along the highways there are always brown boards with points of interest. In general, the brown background color for such signs is the international standard, but in Slovenia these boards are also huge and illustrated.

A typical Slovenian village centers around a church with a narrow, pointed tower.

The landscape throughout the country is approximately this hilly. There seem to be higher mountains closer to the Austrian border.

A mailbox in Slovenia is similar to mailboxes in other countries in this part of Europe.

Near the city of Postojna, our driver turned towards Trieste. There, at a gas station, we quickly found a driver who gave us a ride to coastal Koper. He had a very interesting car with advanced cruise control, which “knew” the road, “saw” neighboring cars, and automatically accelerated the car up to 160 km/h in the right areas, and then slowed down at the right moment. I have never seen anything like this before. From Koper in half an hour by bus you can get to the final point of the route in Slovenia - the city of Piran.

<h2>Piran</h2>
<p>
Piran is an old Italian city that ended up in Yugoslavia and then in Slovenia after Italy's defeat in World War II. Few people know that for more than 10 years after the war, Trieste was an independent city-state, like West Berlin or earlier <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/281976.html">Gdansk</a>. De facto, the territory was half controlled by the American army, half by the Yugoslav army. Then it was divided in two, the city of Trieste itself returned to Italy, and the southern part went to Yugoslavia, now these are the cities of Koper, Izola, Piran in Slovenia and Umag in Croatia.
<p/>

<p>
The Italian population has mostly left Piran, but signs in Italian still hang, although there is Lenin Street.

Garbage is sometimes collected in special recesses.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256850198_82b681f119_o.jpg">
<p>
In general, Piran is similar to other old towns located along the Adriatic coast all the way to Montenegro.

There are quite few tourists here compared to Croatia. Nearby there is the resort town of Portorož with large hotels, there are more people there.
<p/>

For just 50 cents, you can walk through an automatic door to the old walls.

There is nowhere to swim in Piran, there is only a small area where you can descend into the water from stone slabs.

After the hilarious hitchhiking, the first thing I wanted to do was eat. The dish on the right is called "cevapi" or "cevapcici", Bosnian, although found throughout Yugoslavia. The restaurant was called "Sarajevo". The dish on the left is “pljeskavica”, a pork chop that I already tasted when I was in <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/304491.html">Serbia</a>. Prices in Piran are lower than in Western Europe and Russian restaurants; the entire dinner cost about 10 euros.

Slovenia is a small and modest cozy country. Even monuments to freedom fighters are placed somewhere in the corner and are half human height.

<h2>Koper</h2>
<p>
The Yugoslav Adriatic coast begins from Koper (Capodistria in Italian). Like Piran, it is also a former Italian, and even earlier Venetian city. The tower, like the one on St. Mark's Square, will tell you.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256480533_4fbf8e8854_o.jpg">
<p>
Lest you think that Koper is just the old town, this is what most of the city looks like.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257028994_aa87ed08ff_o.jpg">
<p>
There are also multi-storey buildings.

<h2>Ljubljana</h2>
<p>
They say that many people confuse Slovenia and Slovakia. Hint: in Slovak “Slovakia” is Slovensko, and “Slovenia” is Slovinsko. In Slovenian, “Slovakia” is Slovacka, and Slovenia is Slovenija. So if you see a euro coin with the inscription Slovensko, it is from Slovakia, although Slovenia also has euros.
Ljubljana is a city of expressive sculptures.
<p/>

In general, in Slovenia, if you try, you can find socialist relics. The hotel, for example, looked like an ordinary student dorm.
