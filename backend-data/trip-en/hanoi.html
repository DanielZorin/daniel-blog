<h1>Vietnam: Da Nang, Hoi An, Hue, Haiphong, Cat Ba, Hanoi</h1>
<i>8-16 August 2015</i>
<h2>Da Nang</h2>
<p>
Having first arrived at the airport, I went to the hotel on foot: the walk was about 20 minutes (In <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/307590.html">Biarritz</a> and <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/323897.html">Eilat</a> I also walked to the airport, but did not fly from there). What kind of country Vietnam is, and how decent it is there, I had no idea, expecting something sad on the level of the Philippines. But no, Da Nang turned out to be a very civilized and pleasant city.

<p>
The main attraction of the city is the bridge in the shape of a dragon; many tourists take photographs around it.

On the other side of the embankment, they sell ice cream.

As in other Asian countries, there are many things sold from stalls here.

In the evening, chairs are placed on the sidewalks so you can drink beer and eat barbecue.

We went to have dinner at a Vietnamese canteen. Simple food - boiled noodles with meat - pleasantly surprised both in taste and price.

<p>
And here is a signature Vietnamese snack - a French bun with filling. Costs from 10,000 dong ($0.5). Such buns are also available in other former French colonies (Cambodia, Laos), but it was in Vietnam that they were brought to perfection. This is the perfect breakfast or snack.

In the morning it turned out that the city consists of brand new narrow and long houses.
<p/>

There are no slums, at most old buildings.

There is, as it were, communism in Vietnam, and there is plenty of corresponding symbolism.

And there are relatively few temples here, like in China.

Train Station. Trains run across the country, but rather slowly. Buses are faster and the price is about the same.

On the way to the neighboring town of Hoi An, you can see several karst mountains similar to Yangshuo. There are many such landscapes in Vietnam, the most famous is in Ha Long Bay.

<h2>Hoi An</h2>
<p>
The town of Hoi An is one of the very rare (for Southeast Asia) examples of a beautiful old city in the European sense: so you can walk around the center and enjoy the architecture. You can thank the Chinese expat traders for this, who built most of Hoi An's attractions.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256384678_3923e1f00a_o.jpg">
<p>
Even the ticket system here is similar to the Chinese one: you buy a ticket for about $5, which allows you to enter different temples and reception halls. You can just walk around the city for free if you don’t enter from the main street.
<p/>

Chinese temples always have long spirals that burn slowly.

With a ticket you can also enter several houses of respected families. Essentially, you find yourself in a hallway, behind it is a kitchen, where the owners are cooking something.

Vietnam has an intercity bus system, originally made for tourists, connecting the main interesting cities from Hanoi in the north to Ho Chi Minh City in the south (fortunately Vietnam is narrow and long). You can take a single ticket from end to end and get off in different cities. Hoi An is one of the stops for such buses, but Da Nang, which is 25 kilometers away, is not, and there are significantly fewer tourists in Da Nang.

<h2>Hue</h2>
<p>
It is easier to get from Da Nang to Hue by train - from city center to city center and cheaper. The cheapest class of carriages is with wooden benches and fans.

<h2>Haiphong</h2>
<p>
In Vietnam, it is quite difficult to get off the popular tourist route. Due to the shape of the country, there is essentially only one road from north to south, interesting stops on it are quite obvious, and getting to non-tourist cities is inconvenient - you need to look for local bus stations. So the most unusual place I got to was Haiphong, the fourth largest city in Vietnam. Many people pass through Haiphong on the way to Halong Bay using a combo ticket, but I walked around Haiphong for several hours on a transfer (by the way, buying tickets separately was a little cheaper).

Intercity buses in Vietnam can be quite comfortable, but you can be unlucky. I drove from Hue overnight here:

There is enough legroom, it’s soft, there is even wi-fi. The bus back from Haiphong was much less convenient; fortunately, the ride to Hanoi was only three hours.

Vietnam has its own territorial claim (like the Kuril Islands for the Japanese or the Falkland Islands for the Argentines). These are the Spratly Islands, a group of uninhabited rocks in the South China Sea. Although there is nothing on the islands, they are claimed by all neighboring countries: China, Vietnam, Taiwan, the Philippines and Malaysia. Control over the islands will make it possible to control transit routes in this region, and oil may also suddenly be discovered there. The islands are de facto owned by China, they have even built military bases on a couple of rocks. In every Vietnamese city there will be a large stand dedicated to the problem of illegally occupied territories with a detailed justification of the claims.

Another half hour by bus through the industrial zone, half an hour by ferry, half an hour by bus - and you are in Ha Long Bay.

<h2>Ha Long Bay</h2>
<p>
Many tourists go to Ha Long Bay on a day trip from Hanoi. It’s inexpensive, but I figured that almost the whole day would be spent on the road, since the drive takes 4-5 hours one way. This means that the only way out is to stay overnight in the bay itself!

There are two routes - from the north through Halong and from the south through Haiphong and Cat Ba Island. There is some chaos going on with the northern route, it is unclear where to find public buses, the entire infrastructure is aimed at organized groups. For individuals the southern path is the best. There are many hotels on Cat Ba Island because it is being developed as a beach resort in itself. I easily found a great room for $9 with air conditioning.

The boat excursion cost $18 per person. The ship is quite large, there is a room below with tables and an upper deck. One could fit 60-70 people on the boat (and any tour operator for Russians would do this), but we had only 15 people in our group, so there was more than enough space for everyone on the deck alone. The audience was mostly adults; there were no 18-20 year old teenagers. The last time I went on an excursion was 8 years ago in Egypt. Anyone who has been to such events knows the main disadvantages: half the time is spent visiting souvenir and jewelry shops, where the tour operator receives a commission, and everything is often delayed, because it is not easy to synchronize 40 people and wait for everyone from the toilet. I had very good impressions from the Vietnamese excursion, because there was nothing like that.

The program is something like this. First, you sail between the islands for two hours, looking at the landscapes. The ship then parks near one of the lagoon islands and everyone transfers to kayaks (attached to the ship on the right). Next was a very rich lunch, which was prepared on the ship itself, with a dozen different dishes. Then the way back with two stops for swimming.

The technology is approximately the same as in <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/397719.html">Yangshuo</a>: streams of water carved out pieces of rock between the rocks, and then the sea level dropped, and they ended up above the surface.

Where there is a small strip of land with sand, a small hotel can be built. For me, staying in such a place for more than one day is boring and expensive.

I have bad luck with mausoleums. It is very inconvenient to get into it in Moscow, and I only visited it once in my childhood. Didn't get to one in <a href="http://juan.livejournal.com/389811.html">Beijing</a> due to repairs. Getting up early in the morning, I went to see Ho Chi Minh.

Hanoi is a city of average interest. Although there was no war here, as in the south and center, there is not much to see. The city center is filled with retail outlets and hotels.

Vietnamese food outlets are all concentrated a little further. Typical menu constructor. The first word is the type of meat.

My main task was to find Thit Cho, that is, dog meat. But it was nowhere to be found, although in the north of Vietnam this dish should be relatively widespread. I tried to search on the map and ask passers-by, but all I found was a place where you can buy this meat by weight.

It seems that there is a whole street with dog meat restaurants, but it is somewhere far from the center. And the place is cool - trains pass above.
