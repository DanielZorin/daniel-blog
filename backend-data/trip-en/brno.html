<h1>Czech Republic: Brno, Austerlitz</h1>
<i>23-25 May 2012</i>
<h2>Austerlitz</h2>
<i>On the Pratzen Heights, where he had fallen with the flagstaff in his hand, lay Prince Andrew Bolkónski bleeding profusely and unconsciously uttering a gentle, piteous, and childlike moan.

Toward evening he ceased moaning and became quite still. He did not know how long his unconsciousness lasted. Suddenly he again felt that he was alive and suffering from a burning, lacerating pain in his head.

“Where is it, that lofty sky that I did not know till now, but saw today?” was his first thought. “And I did not know this suffering either,” he thought. “Yes, I did not know anything, anything at all till now. But where am I?”

He listened and heard the sound of approaching horses, and voices speaking French. He opened his eyes. Above him again was the same lofty sky with clouds that had risen and were floating still higher, and between them gleamed blue infinity. He did not turn his head and did not see those who, judging by the sound of hoofs and voices, had ridden up and stopped near him.</i>

The Austerlitz adventure began when I took a train from Brno to the village of Blažovice. The next plan was to reach Prace, where the Battle of Austerlitz memorial is located, and then walk to Slavkov u Brna, the city formerly called Austerlitz. However, the plan failed due to the fact that I chose the wrong direction across the field, towards the village of Krenovice. Having found out the way from the local residents, I had to make a detour and go to Prace through Zbysov, as a result there was no time or energy left for the ten-kilometer path to Slavkov through Krenovice. Fortunately, the bus driver took us a couple of stops to Slavkov and even allowed us not to punch the ticket.

<p>
The village of Blažovice is notable for the fact that children paint urns there.
<p/>

<p>
The village is quite prosperous.
<p/>

<p>
The battlefield is located south of Blažovice.

<p>
The road into the field is a country road, where it intersects with the railway tracks, there is a bridge, under which you can see that approximately the same thing is written on the walls in all countries.
<p/>

<p>
Finally I approach Krenovice.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256892530_b1568622a2_b.jpg"/>
<p>
Krenovice is a rich village, it has several dozen streets and a couple of thousand inhabitants.
<p/>

<p>
There is a cross near one house.
<p/>

<p>
The sidewalk is covered with tiles, like in Moscow, with an old mini-hatch.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256051368_8f141e4fb2_b.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a restaurant "Kutuzov".
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256598689_bf6eebe8c8_b.jpg"/>
<p>
The next point is the village of Zbysov, quite interesting. The front line was approximately here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255849511_c683610f77_b.jpg"/>
<p>
Here you can find the first tablet about the battle of 1805, with a map of the area and a battle plan.
<p/>

<p>
The rural bus stop is empty. However, there is a timetable, and it is quite clear.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255849541_3170b4bd83_b.jpg"/>
<p>
In this village there is a memorial to those killed in the First World War.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255984727_9a4ac5ce26_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And right next door - those who died in World War II.
<p/>

<p>
Further the road to Prace is clear, but the distance is not close. Along the way, in the middle of the field, there is a modern memorial in honor of the Battle of Austerlitz: a cannonball on three columns. The names of Napoleon, Franz I and Alexander I are engraved on the columns.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255120102_698a3ab899_b.jpg"/>
<p>
Text in French, German and Russian.
<p/>

<p>
Forward - to Prace, left - to Zbysov, right - to Blažovice, back - to Křenovice. Columns with icons are sometimes found along roads, as well as crosses.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255849616_82147a657e_b.jpg"/>
<p>
On the approach to Prace, you can feel a specific smell, as there is some kind of cowshed on the outskirts of the village.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255849626_e8738cdb16_b.jpg"/>
<p>
Prace is a fairly large village with several streets and a grocery store "Hruska", which was closed that day for revision.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256892735_a52f46a63f_b.jpg"/>
<p>
From here, along the street of the same name, you can walk to the “Tomb of Peace” on the hill. To the right of the road there are fields with vineyards.
<p/>

<p>
And here it is, the memorial to the Battle of Austerlitz! Near it there is civilization in the form of a small cafe. There I also got a detailed map of the roads of Moravia, which, in principle, can be used to figure out how to get here.

<p>
Those looking for an easy route can travel to Prace directly from Brno by bus. Prace is the final stop of this route, and after carefully studying the schedule at the stop, I came to the conclusion that there are no other buses here, which means it is impossible to get directly to Slavkov. We had to take the old road to Krenovice.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256598664_900273dc19_b.jpg"/>
<p>
Here is Slavkov-Austerlitz itself, a small well-kept provincial town.
<p/>

<p>
A small palace, for some reason called a “castle,” is the main attraction.

<p>
There is also an antique telephone booth.

<p>
And a store where I saw how they sell beautiful branded Czech mailboxes with a pipe sign.

<h2>Brno</h2>
<p>
I went to Brno for a conference, so I didn’t have much time to explore the city, and after Austerlitz I had almost no energy left. Therefore, I limited myself to the central part of the city and the main attractions. However, the hotel where the conference was held was located on the farthest outskirts, where it took about 20 minutes to get from the center by bus, so I went around there a little. The outskirts look something like this.
<p/>

<p>
Almost one-story America in the center of post-socialist Europe. Two signs on the porch - a house number with a street name and something unclear. Zebetin is the name of the district, but I don’t understand the principle by which numbers like 876 are displayed. The odd/even number does not depend on the side of the street; neighboring houses may have numbers that differ by several dozen.
<p/>

<p>
Here and there in the backyards there are pastoral landscapes, vegetable gardens and barbed wire.
<p/>

<p>
Public transport in Brno, represented by trams and buses, is very well organized. The buses have an electronic display that shows the current stop, the next few, and even whether you need to press a bell button to get off at the stop.
<p/>

<p>
The schedule is accurate to the minute; there is a website through which you can plot a route between any two points in Brno and the surrounding area for several tens of kilometers. Fares depend on zones and time; one ticket can be used to transfer as many times as you like within the zone and time of its validity. The only thing that is not taken into account is that ticket machines only accept cash in coins, and it’s inconvenient to carry a pocket full of 50 CZK coins. Plus, ATMs only issue banknotes, and drivers, on the contrary, may not sell a 35-crown ticket if given a 100-crown banknote. Because of this, on the evening of arrival I missed my bus to the outskirts, and having bought a ticket at a tobacco kiosk, I relaxed at the stop for about 30 minutes.

Of all the places in Brno, only one is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. This is this building.

<p>
Apparently, it is remarkable because any building within a radius of several kilometers is more beautiful than it. For example.
