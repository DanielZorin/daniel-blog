<h1>Egypt: Taba</h1>
<i>January 26 - February 7, 2010</i>
<p>
The last time I was in Egypt in 2010, I was at a hotel in Taba - right on the border with Israel, with an eye on an excursion there. I only have a couple of photos of the hotel left from Egypt. Later I was in the neighboring cities of <a href="../jerusalem">Eilat</a> and <a href="../jordan">Aqaba</a>.
