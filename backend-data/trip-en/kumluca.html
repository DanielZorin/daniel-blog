<h1>Turkey: Kumluca</h1>
<i>10 August 2022</i>
<h2>Kumluca</h2>
<p>
Kumluca is a city neighboring Kemer in the southwest direction. I passed through it in transit on the way to the more distant Kaş and Demre, but did not go into the city itself, since all the most interesting things there are far from the center, you need your own transport. The village closest to Kemer is called Adrasan, it is located south of Çıralı, and is quite similar.

<p>
It also somewhat resembles a backpacker resort.

<p>
Beach. There is almost no one in the middle, since all the hotels are concentrated at the edges.

<p>
A kilometer from the beach there was a huge parking lot for buses, which apparently brought tourists on an excursion to the island of Suluada ("Maldives"), which is just nearby.

The steak cost 200 liras.

<p>
We drive along the mountain road to the village of Karaöz.

Karaöz is picturesque.

<p>
From Karaöz you can drive about three kilometers along a dirt road to the foot of the mountain where the Gelidonia lighthouse stands on the cape of the same name. But the last kilometer was closed; due to the danger of forest fires, walking in forests was generally prohibited in Turkey, including on the Lycian Way.

<p>
Along the way there is also a beach and a camper site, where there were a huge number of local cars.

Beach. By the way, the day was not a day off.
<p/>

<p>
Nearby are the ruins of some kind of fortress.

<p>
You can snorkel a little here, but the underwater world is quite poor (compared to Indonesia).
<p/>

<p>
The larger beach is already behind Karaöz.
<p/>

<p>
Then the road goes along the sea, and there is a rather long and empty beach, essentially all the way to Finike (approximately 20 kilometers).

Greenhouses. When you go down the highway towards Kumluca, you can see a lot of them.

<p>
And here comes Kumluca. This is the most ordinary typical Turkish city, in which there are no tourists at all, although it is adjacent to the most popular resorts.
<p/>

<p>
Most of the houses look new, like almost everywhere else in Turkey.

<p>
Near Kumluca there are the ruins of two ancient cities - Coridalla and Rodiapolis. I no longer had time to get to Rodiapolis (entrance there is only until 17-30), so I stopped at Coridalla, marked on the map with a dot. It turned out it was just a hill.

<p>
But most importantly, there are excellent views in all directions.
