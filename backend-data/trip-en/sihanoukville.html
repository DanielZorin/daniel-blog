<h1>Cambodia: Phnom Penh, Kampot, Kep, Sihanoukville, Battambang, Poipet, Koh Kong</h1>
<i>22 August - 6 September, 29 November - 10 December 2015</i>
<h2>Phnom Penh</h2>
<p>
Cambodia had two stellar moments in history: a thousand years ago it ruled Southeast Asia, and 40 years ago the Khmer Rouge regime tried to raise the country from its knees with mass executions. When I first learned about Pol Pot about 10 years ago, it seemed to me that it was quite recently: my grandmother, for example, witnessed the Second World War, which was 30 years before the Khmer Rouge. But given the low life expectancy in Cambodia, it is now very difficult to meet someone who experienced those times at a conscious age.

<p>
Nazis, Khmer Rouge, ISIS - from reading history books and news it may seem that a small group of obvious (from the outside) maniacs seized power, 99% of the population were brutally oppressed by them, but did not even try to resist somehow. In reality, the regime could not have survived without the support of a large number of ordinary people. In the Genocide Museum, several rooms display ordinary people's opinions of the Khmer Rouge. For example: “Yes, I served the Khmer Rouge, but I don’t regret it. I take care of my wife and children. Let the tribunal judge the leaders of the Khmer Rouge, and they should not hold ordinary people responsible for everything.”
<p/>

<p>
“I don’t regret serving the Khmer Rouge. Whoever is the criminal must answer” (Did he just follow orders?)
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257392999_f024990d38_h.jpg"/>
<p>
These rooms are the most interesting part of the museum because the rest look something like this.
<p/>

<p>
You can't smile or write on the walls.

<p>
By the way, the United States did not oppose the Khmer Rouge because they positioned themselves as Maoists and enemies of Vietnam, which was the main enemy of the United States in the region. Many officials worked under all regimes and have not gone away.
<p/>

<p>
The Khmer Rouge Crimes Tribunal was not established until 20 years after the events, and in its nearly 20 years of operation it convicted only five people.
<p/>

<p>
The Genocide Museum also sells souvenir T-shirts with the inscription “Say NO to genocide!”
<p/>

<p>
The first thing that catches your eye in Phnom Penh is all the houses with long balconies.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256846508_084ea4c40a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Looks like New Orleans.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257688830_8b8eb58846_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The chaos on the roads after Vietnam is not surprising.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257689515_b35d141ebb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But it has its own atmosphere, which consists in the lack of drainage, to put it mildly. After the rain, cars begin to float on the roads.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256645486_b5ba686deb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The temple courtyard through which I wanted to pass turned into a swamp.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257688930_6913e57bb1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And it was so nice.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257392564_9f099579b3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Just an hour ago.

<p>
Something remains from the times of French colonization.

<p>
The most noticeable thing is the central market building.
<p/>

<p>

<p>
The rise of the country from its knees also means the appearance of some modern architecture. Cambodia already has a couple of mini-skyscrapers!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256847183_1de0ec89e7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a similar building in <a href="../mongolia">Ulaanbaatar</a>. In both cases the Chinese are building.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256846643_e09b2b36d2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Along with skyscrapers, public transport appeared in Phnom Penh - several bus routes. Of course, for a city with a million people this is very little, but everything is better than tuk-tuks.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256846563_3deab8c0ef_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The other bank of the Mekong is gradually being built up. Just 10 years ago there was not a single bridge across the Mekong in Cambodia, but now I even personally saw three, one of them near Phnom Penh.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256847473_90a03be4ab_h.jpg"/>
<p>
For now, one huge hotel dominates that shore. Not very convenient in terms of location unless you rent a boat.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256646276_8a7a5fdc1c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The main embankment has been landscaped.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257689665_6fe9ef9782_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The royal palace is located here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256645566_ade8bd5f5f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The monarchy was abolished in 1960 and restored in 1993. There are not as many portraits of the king here as in Thailand.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255917477_68f9ee4026_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are great sunsets on the embankment.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257392729_df19445700_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256645641_3852e602fb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Along with the restoration of the monarchy comes the restoration of spirituality, trampled by the communists. Buddhist temples are being built all over the country, and old ones are being renovated.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257689400_7aaf67cd5c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It is customary here to leave all sorts of offerings in the temple.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255917947_6fd3b40586_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Even pieces of raw meat.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256646091_286c97fba1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The tradition of burning wads of money for good luck is alive and well. You can buy a couple of packs at the market for a dollar. Interestingly, you can buy and burn real money - 100 riel bills. A pack of 100 of these bills costs about $2.5. Unlike the Thais, the Cambodians do not seem to be bothered by the presence of the king's portrait on the banknote.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256645966_7326eef6d9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The Cambodian riel is pegged to the US dollar and ranges from 3800-4200 riel per dollar. You can pay in any shops and markets in dollars (even small ones), in everyday life at the rate of 4000, although in a store with an electronic cash register the conversion is at the rate of 4100 or 4200. At the same time, as you can see, there are not only very high interest rates on dollar deposits (as in Russia), but in riel the rates are even higher.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257688910_d94cc9bbb7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is this place around the corner from the royal palace.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257689685_f6a3282611_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Although Cambodia is no longer the “wild west” it used to be. Pedophilia is now punishable.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257689450_4e2f3c5bab_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Cleanliness in Phnom Penh is not very good, although it can be worse.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255917542_7772c38d92_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Security is generally not bad by world standards, but local rich people still encircle their homes with barbed wire.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256846863_cfc66495a8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Since Cambodia was destroyed by civil wars and began to develop only 20 years ago, and even less with Chinese help, this gives an unexpected bonus: all the infrastructure that exists is quite new. In particular, you will not find a hotel that has not been renovated for 30 years. The Capitol Hotel, for example, is a very good place for $10 with air conditioning. You can also get very cheap rooms from almost $3.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257392439_4ba3e271b8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Downstairs is a restaurant of the same name, where dishes generally cost $1-2.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257393024_971eb068f1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Street signs. All streets have not only names, but also numbers; numbers are often indicated on maps.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257689585_9de09a84b8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Tuk-tuks in Cambodia are all pretty similar. The trolley is attached to the back of the motorcycle, rather than being built on top of it, as in other countries. Occasionally there are unusual examples.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256847533_ef91cbaf17_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is a network of laundries around the city with Wi-Fi and a sumo wrestler on the sign. Why Wi-Fi is in the laundry room is not very clear. At these laundries, you simply drop off your clothes in a bag and pick them up the next day, rather than loading the machine yourself.
<p/>

<p>
Cambodia has not yet reached the heights of civilization, but is gradually moving there.
<p/>

<h2>Kampot</h2>
<p>
Kampot is a regional center in the south of Cambodia. There is no sea, but nevertheless it is often visited by tourists, as they write in guidebooks, “for its relaxed atmosphere.” There is infrastructure in the form of numerous hotels and restaurants, you can live there.
The main attraction of the city is the durian monument. Only in this part of Cambodia are durians grown; during the season you can buy them for $1.5 per kilogram.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255515137_32b2ef775b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In Cambodia, in all provincial cities and even in villages, sculptures are placed at intersections along the highway.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256244776_2bdacb816a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are several of these in Kampot. Here is an square of 2000.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256443833_04f633ee19_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And here is the square with workers extracting salt. People's sculptures are always painted.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256244926_6232d3d5b9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The arrows show which way to go around the circle.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256443573_b5cba3c144_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are a number of administrative buildings built in the colonial style.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257286690_d4c9dfc6e3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
As in other cities, buildings with balconies cover the entire façade.
<p/>

<p>
Banks and reputable companies have glass offices that are higher than ordinary houses.
<p/>

<p/>

<p>
All this is done like a designer - protruding pieces of reinforcement are left on the sides of the house to make it easier to attach to the neighboring house.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257286645_9fc49fbeaa_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The city of Kampot is very close to the sea, on the river bank.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256443768_b9f5a09416_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Local children are not even afraid to swim.

Morning exercises in the central square, just like in China.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256992539_2ef30ae93f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Perhaps the main attraction of Kampot is this. On the corner of the main boulevard and the embankment.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256244951_98fc7ee33f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Best ribs in Cambodia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256992619_b42948ffc1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
A standard portion costs $8 - a kilogram of meat (almost boneless). There is an even larger portion - one and a half kilograms of ribs for $12. If you can eat it alone, your photo will be hung on the honor board. I didn’t try it, one standard portion was enough for us for two.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255515077_509942da95_h.jpg"/>
<p>
For the sake of these ribs, on the way from Sihanoukville to Phnom Penh two months later I stopped in Kampot. The hotel the second time was simply gorgeous, even with the “tree” in the middle of the room.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257507894_c78c1b2f8c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The second time I prepared better - I didn’t eat anything in the morning to make it easier to handle the ribs.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255515192_6ffd62bba6_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Kep</h2>
<p>
If you don’t want the parties of Sihanoukville, you can go to Kep - a small resort town almost near the border with Vietnam.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257013374_54211b22c2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Kep is popular mainly among Cambodians.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256463753_87d19c83b1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Like other residents of Asian countries, Cambodians do not particularly swim in the sea (except for small children). Instead of sitting on the sand on the beach, locals prefer this hammock.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255536112_c284977023_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Or just spread a bedding on the embankment. A picnic in nature.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256464113_816aed1d3f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And there is plenty to picnic here. To do this you need to go to the local market.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256464028_898600c522_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The main delicacy is crabs. There is even a monument to the crab.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256265981_4ede49f9eb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
They are caught right there and unloaded from baskets like these.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255535957_c4cb643f0d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In Russia, crab is a fantastically expensive dish (unless you catch them yourself in Kamchatka). Here they cost $5 per kilogram. For a modest sum they will be prepared right away.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257013194_acda4cfc38_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Ready!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257013224_e9faf77e5b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Cleaning a crab is a science. I even had to Google a training video. There is meat only in the claws and in the middle of the shell. There is so little of it in the claws that I was too lazy to waste time on small ones.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257806345_55e9445439_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is the meat extracted from one crab.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257013254_d4b6fc1723_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And this is from just a kilogram.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257013304_5aeeaa387a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Not just crab - shrimp also cost $5.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257307110_215c074c2e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And this is some kind of unknown fish. The piece is simply gigantic, even minus the rubber veins. At the same time, it’s somehow very cheap - 2 dollars.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257013324_8e61aba2d4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Now let's see the town. This is a row of hotels opposite the beach. There is a bus stop right there. It takes about 20 minutes to the north to get to the market, and about 10 minutes to the east to get to the main part of the city, but the city is quite elongated in this direction.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255535487_8ad713a1de_h.jpg"/>
<p>
One day we chartered bicycles to see the city. The roads are good.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257306530_cb6329a074_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But as soon as you get on the highway leading to Kampot, the good road ends and the unfinished one begins.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256265776_dc5f97c8c3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In the city itself, the main roads are paved, but the side streets are not.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257013114_7c65e525ce_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The main street.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257013039_5cd2173cc3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
As usual, monuments.

<p>
The infrastructure for children in Cambodia is not good. There aren't really any playgrounds for children. The volleyball players made a net from branches and rope.
<p/>

A workshop making benches and altars for offerings. In Cambodia, altars are almost always standard and the same throughout the city.

A bunch of monkeys live near the beach. Monkeys are not at all cute, but very harmful; they can take something away from you if you are careless.

<h2>Sihanoukville</h2>
<p>
Of the many similar resort towns in Southeast Asia, Sihanoukville stands out due to the successful combination of two factors: it is much cheaper than the resorts of Thailand and the Philippines, and there is a lot of party, in contrast to the quiet, family-friendly, conservative cities of Vietnam and Malaysia. In particular, it has some of the best prices in the region for European-style food, which is a welcome change after months of Chinese and Korean food.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256260919_cc7afe51ca_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I have, of course, not visited all the restaurants and eateries in Sihanoukville (there are several dozen of them just near Serendipity Beach, and there are also other areas where I visited once). Many of them are quite ordinary for Asia, such as the eatery with noodles with meat for 7-8 thousand riel ($2) that is closest to my house and market. I will describe several well-remembered establishments that personally receive Michelin stars from me. The first is called Nice Foods, located near Serendipity Beach across the intersection from the well-known Utopia bar.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256556770_f83de54afb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This place is good because it has the lowest prices in the area for non-refined dishes like noodles, soups, sandwiches. At the same time, the menu is very extensive. Noodles cost $1.5-2.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254782297_2169474f0d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
My favorite is the $2 mushroom soup. Shakes cost $1-1.5 everywhere.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255512266_c31787a26f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Sandwiches are cheap - $1.25-$1.5.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254782027_23b090eb97_h.jpg"/>
<p>
If you want fried meat, then opposite, on the street parallel to the beach, there are places with a grill for $3, for example, “Sony and Friend”.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255717913_d27be1fde4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
For $3 this is a very decent dinner.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256261469_036c9fdaff_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Approximate prices can be seen on this menu. This is some kind of establishment on the beach, I haven’t been to it, but I took a picture of the menu because it was in Russian (found in some places in Sihanoukville). Prices here are average by city standards, but if you look, you can find cheaper ones, like at Nice Foods.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256556585_17fa5231bd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And there is such a menu.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256261759_f40a865d8a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Now all sorts of delights. In Sihanoukville, many Chinese run hotels and other businesses, and you can find authentic restaurants with truly Chinese menus. Prices are slightly higher than usual in Cambodia - noodles with egg for $2, with meat for $3.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256259654_db57a101d6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But the tomatoes with eggs are authentic, I guarantee.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255510481_dfc030a048_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And dumplings too.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254780542_e7354d2e5b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I didn’t see seafood directly from the nets, like in Kep, in Sihanoukville, but during the day sellers of shrimp and lobsters constantly walk along the beach. In the evening I somehow managed to get a whole mountain of lobsters for $7.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256556350_113e1a0adc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is one famous place in narrow circles where they serve clams and scallops for $2. No, not per piece, for the whole plate.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256557675_38b57ba848_h.jpg"/>

<p>
It's called Khin's shack. Located on Serendipity Beach towards the end of the built-up area.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255717883_4712944105_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Steaks (with different degrees of doneness, everything as expected) are prepared in the French restaurant Susaday, which is approximately opposite Khin's shack across the road on the second line from the beach.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256261024_52c389e0c1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This place is more for special occasions, although for a steak the price of $8.5 is inexpensive. The sauce for it is with a signature Cambodian spice - Kampot peppers.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256261049_ea0953d66c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Well, the next establishment is for real aesthetes.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256261374_1adacf6527_h.jpg"/>
<p>
"Mom's Kitchen: Feeding Hungry Backpackers Since 2006!" located on the corner of the Utopia bar.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256261439_afd6f6f098_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The downside of this place is that it is very slow. In China and Vietnam, you get used to the fact that after ordering you have to wait for a maximum of 5 minutes, forgetting, like a bad dream, the Russian service where a cup of coffee is brewed for half an hour, then they bring the receipt for half an hour, and another half an hour the change. And the plus of the “kitchen” is that the food there is very tasty. Not just tasty, but very tasty. European dishes. Here's tomato soup for $2.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256261409_947c8d4389_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Pasta costs about $3.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255717978_90911ef48a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Pizza is about $4-5.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254783157_fef369d4a2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And the highlight of the program is barracuda steak for $3! The piece, of course, is small, well, it’s not chicken, but barracuda. It’s not every day that you taste such tender meat, the taste of which doesn’t immediately tell you that you’re eating fish.

Sihanoukville is a fairly large city by Cambodian standards, and it has more than just hotels for beachgoers. For example, here at the entrance to the city there is a factory for the production of Angkor beer. The center of Sihanoukville is not on the seashore, but at a distance of about one and a half kilometers from it, but due to the terrain, it is a walk of three kilometers to the nearest Serendipity beach or you can take a motorcycle taxi for a dollar.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255717413_f396fd817a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
For tourists, the city center is interesting mainly because there is a market and the Sumadera supermarket - probably the most reputable supermarket in the city, where you can buy both imported delicacies and locally produced milk from Sihanoukville. It’s sad to live without a market, because fruits and vegetables are not sold on the beaches. And in the city center you can stay in a hotel, which is what I did all the time.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254782422_71aaec7250_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Zhongguo Guesthouse (China) is located near the Central Market and Capitol Bus Stop. It’s nice that seasonality does not affect the price - a room costs $10 in both August and December. This is a truly Chinese hotel - there are even amulets hanging on the doors.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257873570_83fd01249a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The rooms are spacious, have air conditioning, hot showers, and decent Wi-fi.

<p>
In the center you always have all kinds of fruits at hand; in the morning you can buy crispy French bread for 700 riel ($0.18). Other services are also available, for example, you can get a haircut for $1. But you won’t be able to wake up and go to the beach; it’s a 40-minute walk or a motorcycle ride. But if this is not important to you, then this hotel is the right option, because you won’t find accommodation of this quality for $10 near the beach, especially in high season.

The party in Sihanoukville is on Serendipity Beach. The rest are more suitable for meditation, and Serendipity consists entirely of bars.
<p/>

There are many casinos around. People come to Cambodia from Thailand and Vietnam, where gambling is prohibited. Unlike <a href="../macau">Macau</a>, you can play poker here.

Advertising in Russian. There are a number of Russian-speaking residents in Sihanoukville, because living here for a long time is easier than anywhere else: you pay $300 a year, and your business visa is extended.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256555485_e6032913f4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On the first line of the beach there are only bars, soft chairs and tables next to them, so to sit comfortably on the beach (and not on the sand), you need to buy a shake or coffee for $1. Very convenient, because you still need a cool drink, and when sun loungers belong to hotels, getting them is difficult or expensive.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256556305_61fb30b68f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Happy hour is here 24 hours a day. Cocktails for $2, beer for $0.5.

Further along the coast, part of the beach is popular with Cambodians and visitors from other Asian countries, mainly Chinese.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256556625_177d5fa18c_h.jpg"/>

<p>
The Serendipity area is where Sihanoukville's nightlife centers. You shouldn’t expect something like Full Moon Party - there are much fewer people, but nevertheless, this is a great rarity for the region - a European-style disco, where people party on the dance floor, rather than sitting at tables with beer.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255512391_4e9440bbc5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The oldest bar in Sihanoukville is Utopia. It's more of a pre-party place in the evening. You can live there in a hostel for $2 per bed in a room without air conditioning or $3 with air conditioning.

<p>
You walk through and they give you strong drinks. By the way, flyers are handed out on the streets during the day (and you can find them in the evening), with them you can get free cocktails or beer at certain hours, or get four beers for a dollar. In general, if you want, you can get drunk in Sihanoukville for one dollar or even for free!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254782222_96d1b5f466_h.jpg"/>

In addition to the main Serendipity, there are other beaches in Sihanoukville, where there are significantly fewer people, but also proportionately less infrastructure and entertainment.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255511546_8416ed0632_h.jpg"/>
<p>
First on the list is Victory Beach. From the city center, walk about 4 kilometers in the direction opposite to Serendipity. Main road of Sihanoukville:
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254780972_a4074ce6ac_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The structure looks like a mixture of a temple and a bus stop. The bus station, by the way, is about one and a half kilometers from this place. They say you can’t get a tuk-tuk from the bus station for less than $6, but we paid $2.5.
<p/>

<p>
I heard that Victory is a kind of Russian district. There is an Olivier restaurant here, but in general this place is very small and cramped. A few bars and hotels and that's it. It's all on the hill.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256260129_814f7b35ea_h.jpg"/>
<p>
To get to the beach you still have to go down a dirt road past some huts.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255715858_bc38798002_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The entire beach infrastructure consists of five sun loungers.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255511081_9d82ecab3a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is nothing on the other side, only sand and palm trees.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256260194_69d63ab343_h.jpg"/>

<p>
I had never seen a statue standing in the sea before. In general, the beach is for one time - there is nothing to do except photograph the bull.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255511126_1e84609015_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The next big beach, Independence, is within walking distance, although it's not close. There is a large Independence Hotel there, hence the name of the beach. The hotel is going through hard times.
<p/>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255716293_75cc8f5891_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But it looks good. There are several restaurants. There are, however, no hotels (except for the Independence Hotel) in the vicinity, since there is a lake across the road from the beach, the places are quite deserted and secluded.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256556170_880fda5540_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This beach is interesting primarily because it has the best view of the sunset.

There are a couple more small beaches between Independence and Victory. This is Hawaii Beach.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256555905_e2f43cb610_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And this is Treasure beach, to get to it you need to go along a dead-end branch from the road. A small beach sandwiched between hills. There is one restaurant.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256556435_5a6d670d5f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Between these beaches there is a huge bridge to a small island. The scale of the bridge contrasts greatly with the rest of Sihanoukville.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254781822_86c5fad30c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It is even more surprising that the bridge is simply closed and not in use!
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255511256_5d39f471c0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Here's the view from behind the fence. There is a booth with a guard there. Perhaps he can be bribed with a few dollars, but I haven't checked.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255511701_1f0a58fb7a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The fact is that the well-known Russian businessman Sergei Polonsky wanted to develop this island when he was in Cambodia. Polonsky himself lived on a very tiny island, which is located a little further from the coast. In 2014, they wanted to hold the Kazantip festival (<i>Techno music festival, held annually in Crimea before it was occupied by Russia in 2014</i>) on the island, but local authorities banned it at the last moment (were the Cambodian police really confused by drugs?). Since then, the island has been abandoned, although from the shore it is clear that some hotels have already been built there.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255716628_76c45bf045_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Behind Serendipity Beach is Otres - a place where those who want a quiet but civilized holiday go.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256261809_9d49666cb1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
This is the most beautiful beach in Sihanoukville.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255717623_3e646dc5a0_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The downside is that it is far from the center: you can walk in an hour to Serendipity along the coast, but the road for motorcycles and cars makes a long detour, about 8 kilometers, a motorcycle taxi will cost 2 dollars one way. Apart from the main road, everything else on Otres is great.

<p>
Less than half of the beach has been developed; in other places there is nothing except the road.
<p/>

<p>
In the nearest part of the beach everything is fine, there are cafes and sun loungers.
<p/>

<p>
The water is not as muddy as on Serendipity, and there are fewer boats and jet skis.
<p/>

<p>
And you can see the sunsets quite well from here too.

<h2>Battambang</h2>
<p>
Battambang is the second largest city in Cambodia and is famous for this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256106343_ebdf8db8db_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are several colonial style buildings.

<p>
The river is muddy.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256947960_c588722418_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The city is low-rise, a five-story building already appears in the panorama.
<p/>

Temple gate in Thai style.

At the entrance to the temple there is a poor tiger with a broken head.

<p>
Tuk-tuks are about the same as in Phnom Penh. For the first time, there was a need to ride it - it’s a long way from the bus station to the city center.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256653454_14f91fbb78_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Most of the streets here do not have names, only numbers.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255904976_4422a229c8_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Civilization is present - there is even a 7-11 type store with price tags and self-service.
<p/>

<p>
A monument to a fruit collector on the main square. Unpainted for some reason.
<p/>

Long Cambodian balcony.

<p>
The trash cans look like they are made of tires, like Russian swans.
<p/>

<p>
In the depths of the city I found a temple that was quite luxurious by Cambodian standards.

There are small stupas on the sides.

<p>
From here it is close to the border with Thailand.
<p/>
<h2>Koh Kong</h2>
<p>
The first city after the Thai border, if you drive along the coast. The contrast with Thailand is quite big. As soon as you cross the border, the Thai new highway turns into broken asphalt, although not for long, as you enter the city the road gets better. The alleys can be seas of mud. The city's skyline is dominated by the tax office building.
<p/>

<p>
Nearby are several more brand new administrative buildings and a portrait of the trio of leaders of the ruling party.
<p/>

<p>
The dirtiest and creepiest place in Koh Kong looks like this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255550787_eae55542aa_h.jpg"/>
<p>
However, I only found one such place.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257510954_5f04040ca2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
On the main square there is a monument to grandmother with baskets of fruit.
<p/>

Koh Kong is the rising star of the southwest (Cambodia). Not surprisingly, this is the only city in the southwest.
<p/>

<p>
Some kind of monument, similar in style to Soviet monuments to partisans and soldiers. Built in 2014.
<p/>

<p>
Cool motorcycle.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257322110_1cfa9e4d4a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And not just one, but a whole series.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255550777_330a5e1bcd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The embankment has been improved, but littered.
<p/>

<p>
After this bridge, a couple of kilometers away is the border with Thailand.

In Koh Kong we managed to catch a beautiful sunset over the river.

After this, the city plunged into darkness. Street lighting is present only on a couple of main streets.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257322525_2681158bde_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I found the restaurants in Koh Kong too expensive, but I ended up finding a good place with mostly American food right at the main intersection with the monument.
<p/>

<p>
In the evening, when I went to the store to buy water, a motorcycle taxi driver offered me a ride to a chicken farm. This is what red light districts are called in Cambodia. They are located outside the city and consist of small wooden houses on stilts, in each of which you can be served.
