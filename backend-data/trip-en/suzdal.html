<i>16-18 August 2013</i>
<h2>Suzdal</h2>
<p>
Suzdal is the case when it is better to see once than to hear a hundred times.

I had already been to Suzdal two years ago, so I remembered the city quite well. It's beautiful everywhere here.

<p>
This time I also went to the areas located east of the main street.

All roads lead to the Kremlin.

There are chimes there.

It is definitely worth going through Ilyinsky Meadow, from there you will find the best views of the Kremlin and the rest of the city.

<p>
The main thing is not to get into the swamp, which is in the middle of the meadow; you need to follow the path.

<p>
The church on the hill still stands dilapidated, although in 2011 it was possible to somehow get inside, but now there are bars on all the windows.

<p>
But an exemplary road leads to it.

<p>
Even in Suzdal there are tacky remakes, but only a few.

<p>
The main disadvantage of Suzdal is high prices.

<p>
For example, hotels here start from 2000 rubles. In taverns, on the other hand, prices compare favorably with those in Moscow.

Suzdal is the most beautiful small city in Russia.
