<h1>Russia: Suzdal</h1>
<i>16-18 August 2013</i>
<h2>Suzdal</h2>
<p>
Suzdal is the case when it is better to see once than to hear a hundred times.

I had already been to Suzdal two years ago, so I remembered the city quite well. It's beautiful everywhere here.

<p>
This time I also went to the areas located east of the main street.

<p>
All roads lead to the Kremlin.

<p>
There are chimes there.

<p>
It is definitely worth going through Ilyinsky Meadow, from there you will find the best views of the Kremlin and the rest of the city.

<p>
The main thing is not to get into the swamp, which is in the middle of the meadow; you need to follow the path.

<p>
The church on the hill still stands dilapidated, although in 2011 it was possible to somehow get inside, but now there are bars on all the windows.

<p>
But an exemplary road leads to it.

<p>
Even in Suzdal there are tacky remakes, but only a few.

<p>
The main disadvantage of Suzdal is high prices.

<p>
For example, hotels here start from 2000 rubles. In taverns, on the other hand, prices compare favorably with those in Moscow.

Suzdal is the most beautiful small city in Russia.
