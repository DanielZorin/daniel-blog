<h1>Iraq: Kirkuk, Mosul, Erbil</h1>
<i>1-4 November 2023</i>
<h2>Kirkuk</h2>
<p>
The city of Kirkuk is known as the center of Iraqi oil production. Because of this, it is disputed between central Iraq and Kurdistan. Amid the ISIS offensive in 2014, the Kurds briefly captured Kirkuk, but it is now back under federal government control. The most ironic thing is that in fact most people in Kirkuk are neither Kurds, nor Arabs, but... Turks. More precisely, Iraqi Turkmens (or Turkomans). They speak the Turkmen dialect of Turkish, which is similar to Azerbaijani or the eastern dialects of Turkey.

<p>
The blue and white flag with a crescent is the flag of the Turkmens. This is the entrance to some village on the way to Kirkuk from Baghdad.

Some kind of fortified point. These are common in northern Iraq, perhaps due to the recent war.

<p>
In Kirkuk, many people understand Turkish, it was easier for me to communicate. The inscriptions are also duplicated in Turkish.

From the other side I was able to get to the fence. Previously, people lived in the fortress, but recently almost everything inside was demolished, and now it is a wasteland.

<h2>Mosul</h2>
<p>
Mosul is the second largest city in Iraq with a sad fate. In 2014, ISIS boldly attacked Mosul, the Iraqi army was forced to retreat, and the city of a million fell under the control of the terrorist group in a couple of days. It was here that ISIS proclaimed their “world caliphate.” Half the population fled. For three years, Mosul was the capital of ISIS in Iraq; at its peak, the terrorists controlled most of northern Iraq and came close to Baghdad (Fallujah is only 50 kilometers away). In 2016-2017, the epic battle for Mosul took place, which lasted nine months and ended with the liberation of the city, and with it, essentially, ISIS in Iraq was defeated and went underground. Such a long battle meant ruthless urban warfare for every stronghold, leaving the entire central part of Mosul in ruins in 2017. Over the past six years, something has already been rebuilt, and life has returned to the city, but much remains to be done.
<p/>

<p>
The entrance to the center of Mosul looks something like this:

<p/>

Some passages are blocked, something is already being built there.

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53325441059_d05869d24c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And some things have already been rebuilt, for example this mosque. The previous photo, by the way, was taken from the same point as this one.
<p/>

Here is another photo from the same point.

In the middle of the old city is the Al-Nuri Mosque (or rather, what remains of it).
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53325440934_1907e79039_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The ISIS caliphate was proclaimed in this mosque. During the retreat, the ISIS fighters blew up the mosque and the leaning minaret so that they would not fall to the “traitors.”
<p/>

<p>
There are quite a few Christian churches in the center of Mosul (which is unusual for such an almost mono-religious country as Iraq). The cathedral has already been rebuilt in all its glory.
<p/>

About a third of the houses are inhabited, and from time to time you can see children playing on the streets.

It looks like there are still problems with the water supply here; water from the houses is pouring into the streets into ditches.

Some cars are also found in other places. I’m afraid to imagine how much bombing there was so that the cars turned into this.

In the very north was the citadel of Mosul. It was also very badly damaged. These are the remains of a palace.

Let's see Mosul outside the old city. The inscription “I love Mosul” is already there. Or maybe it even survived ISIS, it looks shabby.

Mosul is located on the site of the ancient city of Nineveh, the capital of the Assyrian Empire. Nineveh stood on a hill on the left bank of the Tigris.
<p/>

I climbed this hill. There were no fences, just a dusty path up.

Near Nineveh I discovered a (comparatively) expensive restaurant - an extremely rare sight in Iraq.

I ordered this dish for 20,000 ($12), it was called “Mosul-style meat.” It was delicious.

<h2>Erbil</h2>
<p>
Erbil is the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan. Kurdistan is somewhat isolated from the rest of Iraq, there was no war here, tourists have been allowed here for a long time on separate visas, so the infrastructure here is somewhat better - there are all sorts of chain brand stores and many hotels. The city is built in rings, and in the middle there is a citadel on a hill, listed as a World Heritage Site.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53324235647_033a4d66db_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Though the citadel is under restoration, and the entrance there is completely closed.

Erbil Airport has special security measures. First, the taxi I was traveling in was searched with dogs, and I had to get out of the car. The taxi driver took me to a separate terminal, where they only checked my ticket. And then I had to wait for a special bus, which takes you to the main terminal, where you get the boarding card and pass regular security.
