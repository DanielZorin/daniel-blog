<h1>Sweden: Stockholm</h1>
<i>4 December 2016</i>
<h2>Stockholm</h2>
<p>
This was my first time on an overnight cruise! In general, cruises as a way of travel in most cases are inferior in all respects to any other options, even bus tours. On bus tours, at least cities like Rome or Paris are allocated 2-3 days, and not half a day, like on a cruise. With a stretch, cruises can be considered justified for traveling around the Caribbean (if you are not alone); nevertheless, by plane it will be cheaper. But as an option for a short weekend trip, a cruise on the Baltic Sea is very good - for the price it turns out to be the cheapest way to travel from Stockholm to Helsinki or Tallinn. From Tallinn a round trip for a cabin for two costs from 50 euros, from Helsinki - from 35. One day in Stockholm, of course, is not enough if this is your first time. Especially on a cruise from Tallinn, because there is less time on shore. But there is enough time to walk through familiar places.

Cabin. So much luggage because I flew there straight from a trip to the Caribbean with a large backpack, and I bought some cheese in Stockholm.

Bar. Bars and restaurants on board are quite expensive, it is better to take food with you.

Swedes buy cases of alcohol on cruises because it is cheaper than on shore.

The downside of a cruise from Tallinn is that the port is a bit far from the center, almost an hour on foot. The Viking Line ferries seem to dock on the south side, closer to the old town.

Rumors about the high cost of Sweden are somewhat exaggerated. I would say that Finland, France, and even Italy will be more expensive for tourists. At least in Italy you can’t eat meat in a restaurant for 7 euros, even for lunch. But in Stockholm it’s possible.

A salmon steak also costs 7 euros, and not only during lunch time.

We had a nice walk. By the way, from Moscow the same trip for three days/four nights is quite feasible, quite inexpensively, if you take an overnight train to/from Ivangorod, cross the border on foot, and get to Tallinn using promotional bus tickets purchased in advance.
