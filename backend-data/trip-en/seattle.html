<h1>USA: Seattle, Portland, San Francisco</h1>

<h2>Seattle</h2>
<p>
After Nevada, the landscape outside the window changes greatly. Now it is no longer a desert, but forests, mountains, rivers, hills. First Oregon, then Washington State.
<p/>

<p>
After studying the map, I came to the conclusion that these were the Three Sisters Mountains in Oregon.

<p>
We are approaching Seattle. The city is located on the shore of a bay, and there are also many islands along the coast.
<p/>

From the window on the other side of the plane, downtown Seattle should have been visible.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255679513_07e26272d6_h.jpg"/>
<p>
We turn over the northern outskirts of Seattle. In the distance to the left is Whitby Island.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255679563_556f8123b4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And now we are flying south towards the airport, and again the city center is on the other side. Here we have a highway and residential areas.
<p/>

<p>
Seattle stands between the bay and the long, elongated Lake Washington. In the distance in the center is the city of Redmond, where the Microsoft office is located.

<p/>

Bellevue has a small downtown with buildings taller than 2 stories.

Seattle is the second technology capital of the United States after San Francisco; two of the largest IT companies are located here: Microsoft and Amazon. The consequence of this is that Seattle is as expensive as San Francisco, and there are even a lot of homeless people on the streets, although it would seem that the climate (rainy, like in England) is not conducive to this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256520940_8153829539_h.jpg"/>
<p>
What do we have in Seattle? For example, the very first Starbucks in the world.
<p/>

But the logo has changed, now someone would probably get offended by such juicy tits.

The Bubblegum Wall is another atypical attraction.

In the early 20th century, all of central Seattle was raised to second-floor level to solve sewer and storm drainage problems. The streets were laid at the second floor level on stilts, and the former first floors became basements. Only the rails remained at the same level, so here you can clearly see that all the buildings start above ground level.

If you go up to the open space along one of the streets, you can see the panorama of the city for free.

In the foreground, the Space Needle tower stands away from the main group of skyscrapers.
<p/>

It was originally built as an observation deck and restaurant for the World's Fair, just like the Eiffel Tower in Paris almost a hundred years earlier.

There is also a tourist monorail with two stops, which, however, is part of Seattle public transport and accepts passes for payment.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255683188_208c8e1cb1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is also a metro in Seattle, or rather the Light Rail, which can also take you to the airport. On the diagram, all stations are indicated by pictograms, like in the <a href="../mexico">Mexico City</a> metro.
<p/>

Train.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255476396_6a75decc18_h.jpg"/>
<p>
It is unusual that in the city center the stations are underground, and they serve both trains (more like trams here) and buses at the same time. The train pulled away, followed by the bus.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255476416_30f28e5b9e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
What is inconvenient is the lack of day tickets, which are so good in almost all cities in the USA and Canada, except New York. In Seattle, if you are a tourist, you will have to buy tickets for one trip for more than three dollars, however, they allow free transfers - the driver gives you a ticket, torn off at the current time.

I went to the Fremont area, primarily because there is a monument to Lenin. It turned out that someone had painted Lenin’s hands as if with blood.
<p/>

<p>
History of the monument. Lewis Carpenter found it in the late 80s in Poland in a garbage dump, where it was dumped after the overthrow of communism, and brought it to his home. Somehow it ended up in Seattle, and everyone got used to it standing on the street.

Last time I walked through a cheap Walmart store, and now I can look at the not-so-cheap one. This is a Kress IGA supermarket, not a chain, located in the very center of Seattle. Of course, Seattle is a much more expensive city than Atlanta, but this should have little effect on food prices; geography is also hardly important here, because logistics to both cities are equally convenient, this is not Alaska.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255986348_8af4a743e7_h.jpg"/>

In general, everything is expensive here, about the same as in <a href="../basel">Switzerland</a>, but it’s still cheaper and healthier than eating at McDonald's all the time .

<h2>Portland</h2>
<p>
All my plans for Portland were ruined by the monstrous delay of the bus from Seattle by 7 hours - as a result, instead of almost the whole day, I barely had time to walk through the very center of the city before dark, and I wantede even to go to the neighboring city of Vancouver, the namesake of the Canadian city. Portland is the largest city in Oregon, but, as is often the case in America, it is not the capital. Now Portland is following the path of its northern brother Seattle with an influx of tech companies and hipsters. Portland took a respectable second place on my list of cities with the most expensive housing in the world, since a bed in a hostel here cost more than $47, but still 16 cents cheaper than the previous day in Seattle. On the other hand, in Seattle four days earlier another hostel cost “only” $33 (but later there were no places there), but in Portland there is only one hostel and there is no choice.

Portland is not a very high-rise city, the downtown looks something like this.

Portland also has a wide network of light rail, which can even take you to the airport.
<p/>

<h2>San Francisco</h2>
<p>
On the way back I had a long layover in San Francisco. I initially thought of going somewhere near the airport, for example to Stanford University, which is much closer than the city center. But that day my strength left me, so I stayed at the airport, however, I still looked a little at San Francisco and Silicon Valley from above.

We are approaching San Francisco from the north, from Portland. Along the shores there are cliffs and forests, no cities are visible.
