<h1>Iceland</h1>
<i>18-20 May 2018</i>
<h2>Reykjavik</h2>
<p>
After the trip to the Balkans in the distant summer of 2014, I had only two unvisited countries in Europe. Getting to Ireland was difficult because of visa, but in Iceland there was no such difficulty - it’s in the Schengen zone. It’s quite possible to fly there inexpensively, but I put off the trip because I realized that it would be a shame to purposefully go there without a car. And finally, in 2018, I visited Iceland while passing through, because it was just halfway between Europe and Canada, and the now deceased airline WOW Air sold cheap tickets.

Two thirds of the 300 thousand Icelanders live in Reykjavik.

There is not much unusual architecture here, I would say that it looks like a province in <a href="../savonlinna">Finland</a>.

Cold winds often blow here, and it seems that this ribbed surface is better resistant to it.

The central square of Reykjavik looks like this:

And two steps away is the second main square.

Iceland is expensive. Chicken noodles cost $13, even more than in New York.

At the same time, dishes in the restaurant cost about the same - $13 (1500-1600 ISK).

It takes about an hour to get to the airport from Reykjavik with a transfer in the neighboring city of Hafnarfjörður, so I also explored this city (with a population of 30 thousand).

Let's look at prices in perhaps the most expensive country in the world. I've only been to the most frequent chain, "10-11" in Reykjavik, which is more of an extended version of 7-11. There is a cheaper "Bonus" store, which I have not been to.
Prices are indicated in Icelandic krona. At that time, the rate was at its peak - 100 crowns per 1 US dollar, but now the rate has dropped to 120-125, that is, Iceland has fallen in price by 20%. Although even with such a discount it is expensive. For example, a bottle of Pepsi costs $6! I have never seen it cost more than 3 in any country, even in Switzerland.

<h2>Golden Ring</h2>

I devoted my second day in Iceland to a trip around the “Golden Circle” - the famous sights of Iceland. The full day excursion cost less than 50 euros - surprisingly cheap, less than the trip from the airport to Reykjavik and back.

Interestingly, 1000 years ago there were many forests in Iceland, as the climate was warmer. Cold weather and deforestation led to the destruction of almost all forests by the first Viking colonists.

The weather in Iceland is very harsh, especially in the interior of the island. There was a terrible wind blowing, so strong that it was physically difficult to walk against it, and I took off my glasses because I was afraid that they would blow off. At the same time, it began to rain periodically, which felt like a lot of mosquito bites from all sides. An umbrella in Iceland is completely useless because the wind will blow it apart 5 seconds after you open it.
