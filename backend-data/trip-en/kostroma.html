<h1>Russia: Ivanovo, Kostroma</h1>
<i>3-4 November 2011</i>
<h2>Ivanovo</h2>
<p>
Some say that Ivanovo is a city of brides. Some say that this is a city of traffic light poles. Also, undoubtedly, Ivanovo is a city of exclamation marks.

In general, the city looks nicer than I imagined. Of course, the beauty brought on is mainly external, but that’s not bad either.

The main place in the city, ironically, is named after Rio de Janeiro. This is a large store where you can buy textile materials at a good price.

The domes of the churches are painted radically black, apparently to create a gloomy mood.

Wonderful greetings from the distant, pre-war past. It is very likely that the name could have been preserved from those times, although now few people remember its meaning.

Kokhma is a suburb of Ivanovo. Typical Russian small town.

<h2>Volgorechensk</h2>
On the way to Kostroma we came across the city of Volgorechensk. Everything is boring here.

And here too. The most beautiful building in the city is the local administration.

And only the standard bright green Sberbank ATM stands out.

<h2>Kostroma</h2>
<p>
You can't help but love Kostroma. I just left the station and immediately saw beautiful architecture.

These are the bus stops.

Beautiful wooden houses in good condition.

There was a United Russia rally in the central square. Pathos flowed like a river.

A street called Molochnaya Gora (Milk Mountain) descends to the Volga from here. In the distance you can see the famous monument to Lenin, standing on a pedestal made in tsarist times and not completed.

Each house must have at least three signs with the house number. On the corner houses there are six.

There's a complaint box hanging here. Bailiffs have not mastered the Internet and accept anonymous denunciations only in writing and by telephone.

Rarely, but there are greetings from Soviet times.

A great rarity is instructions for using a device called a gas heater. It is still often used in the provinces, where hot water is turned off for a long time. The woman’s face on the poster is Soviet-style, gloomy and uncompromising.

In the evenings the city is surprisingly deserted. It has just gotten dark and there are almost no passers-by on the central streets. On the outskirts, on the way to the station, we came across a block of student dormitories, and there was no one there either.
