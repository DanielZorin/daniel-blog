<h1>Somaliland: Hargeisa, Berbera</h1>
<i>9-11 July 2024</i>
<h2>Hargeisa</h2>
<p>
Somalia! How cool it sounds. A country whose name has become a symbol for a collapsed state. Somalia has not existed de facto since 1991. Times have been different since then, somewhere in the early 2000s it seemed to be more or less stable, in the 2010s it was very bad. Now it is somehow average - it seems they do not shoot or blow up actively, but there is no unity either. In fact, there are three states on the territory of Somalia. The first is Somaliland, the northwestern part. Somaliland declared independence in 1991, and after a couple of years of war it received this independence, although no one has recognized it to this day. The second is Puntland (northeast), which announced its withdrawal from the federation in March 2024. And the third part, where the capital is Mogadishu. Part of the territory there is in fact controlled by various unions of Sharia courts and other terrorist organizations. The easiest part to visit is Somaliland where you can get a visa upon arrival and travel on your own.

Before departure, I booked a cheap hotel that I found on Google maps (some hotels are also in booking systems, but they are more expensive).
<p/>

<p>
The $10 hotel is not bad at all (no air conditioning, but it wasn't too hot). I didn't expect that in such a non-tourist country.

<p>
And on the way from the airport it was clear that it's not that bad here, at least business is actively developing.
<p/>

Lots of shops.

There are goats grazing there with a number written on them.

The river is completely dry. The city center is to the north of it.

Entrance to the city center. Instead of a greeting - an advertisement for a furniture store.

<p>
In general, this is some kind of incredible feature of Somalia. Where there are usually some statues, obelisks and other monuments, in Hargeisa there are structures with advertisements.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945085732_179aef044e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is only one large monument here - to an old Soviet plane from the war of independence.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946247873_95d3b2ba1a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is another monument nearby from a local bank. This is the local currency - Somaliland shillings (the rest of Somalia also uses shillings, but different ones).
<p/>

<p>
You can exchange money in these kiosks with wads of cash. For 1 dollar they give about 9000 shillings.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945085502_3ac4200c2b_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Bills of 1 and 5 thousand are in circulation, that is $0.10 and $0.50. Also, everyone accepts cash dollars, it is easier to pay for larger purchases with them. Locals pay via mobile phone, even beggars sit with a piece of paper with a number where to send donations.
<p/>

Central mosque.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946247768_4017cf0b3e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The mosques in Somalia are reminiscent of Saudi Arabia or Oman.
<p/>

<p>
I didn't find any more sights in Hargeisa, so I continued walking around the market, exploring local life.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945985081_69552724bd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The most striking element is the kiosks in bright green colors.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945085687_a5120a249f_h.jpg"/>
<p>
They sell khat. Khat leaves contain the psychoactive substance cathinone. The most famous chemical relative of cathinone is 4-methyl-meth-cathinone, better known as mephedrone, the most popular drug in Russia. Such a broom costs about $2.5. You only need to eat the leaves, and only the small ones, which are closer to the stem.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946444680_14afd62be3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
These stalls not only sell khat, but also offer vanue to consume it, hang out, and chat. I was also generously treated, I ate everything, but I didn't get the feel. In the end, I got tired of it, and I just bought a whole bunch, and gnawed on it little by little until the evening, until it started to work.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946247728_8a706a5aa4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Most of the stalls in the market have a red roof.
<p/>

<h2>Road to Berbera</h2>
<p>
On the second day I went to the second city of Somaliland - Berbera. Blogs and guidebooks have very different opinions about freedom of movement in Somaliland. Somewhere it is written that tourists need to hire armed guards, as in the main part of Somalia. I decided to take a risk and just got on a minibus. In the end, they looked at my passport only once when leaving Hargeisa. We also got there much faster than I thought, since the road is good and there are almost no stops. I sat in the seat next to the driver and looked at the scenery.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946410115_b356cbc044_h.jpg"/>
<p>
At first, the scenery is completely flat.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945050907_aae6525a06_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945950721_254741e365_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are villages along the way.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945050927_506c921299_h.jpg"/>
<p>
They look very modest, but along the roads there are some shops and even restaurants, hastily made from metal sheets.
<p/>

<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945950731_8bde3c6120_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The most solid are the mosques.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946213198_0535a04750_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Garbage removal is a problem, every village has a landfill on the edge.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945950606_009e169015_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Many villages have checkpoints that look something like this. The driver would greet someone there, and they would let us through.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946288139_55eb13fc14_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The road itself is excellent.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946288234_344e7280ee_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Gradually the landscape becomes less flat. Small gorges appear with streams flowing through them.

<h2>Berbera</h2>
<p>
Berbera is the second city of Somaliland, the former capital and main port.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946287964_f9de2f30f4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I left a little earlier than the center to see the area called "Moscow".
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946288074_ce0ef6d5a4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The architectural style is really recognizable. In the 1970s, there was a Soviet military base here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53945950551_7ff1c3b578_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In 1977, Somalia invaded Ethiopia to conquer the Ogaden province, where ethnic Somalis live. Both countries were rather pro-Soviet, but Ethiopia was more so, as a result, the USSR supported it, and the military base was driven out of Somalia so quickly that they barely had time to evacuate.

Somalia lost the war, and this is where the country's mischief begins.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53946212963_f1fe74c210_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And the area is now an ordinary residential area.
<p/>

<p>
Just a residential area of ​​Berbera.

I approach the center.

<p>
Unlike Hargeisa, there is still some colonial architecture preserved here.

Very soon during the walk I realized that it was very hot. After checking the weather, I found out that it was +45 without the slightest shade, that is, in fact, much hotter. I don’t think I’ve ever been so hot. At the same time, there was absolutely nowhere to hide - I didn’t find a single restaurant. The maximum I could do was take water from a kiosk and under a canopy, and even then the refrigerators weren’t very good, and the water wasn’t refreshing. I decided to move towards the bus station, which is located on the edge of the city center. There was a complete desert around the bus station, and only a lot of ibises.
