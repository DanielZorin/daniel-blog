<h1>Russia: Torzhok, Ostashkov, Toropets, Rzhev</h1>
<i>5-7 September 2020</i>
<h2>Torzhok</h2>
<p>
Torzhok is one of the most beautiful cities in Russia, with a very large old center. This could be the second <a href="http://goo.gl/6bHFQ4">Suzdal</a>, but Suzdal was made a tourist city back in Soviet times, and therefore was preserved, and in Torzhok they built factories right in the premises of churches , and they started putting things in order only in the 2010s, so the city still has a long way to go, but I hope everything will work out.

<p>
The train station, bus station and most businesses are located on the high bank of the Tvertsa River, in the same place as the old Moscow-St. Petersburg highway, and most of the historical center is on the other bank.

The first thing that caught my eye was a lot of abandoned houses, completely destroyed inside.

There are two bridges across the river: pedestrian and automobile.
<p/>

Near the car there is a rather large cathedral, which is currently being restored.

Between two bridges on the embankment, the only polished piece of Torzhok suddenly appears.

Stunning views from the top. Thanks to the bends of the river and steep hills, Torzhok is very photogenic, like <a href="http://goo.gl/Bkoe48">Porto</a>.

Let's walk through the streets of Torzhok. Here the old city has been preserved not on a couple of streets, as in other cities, but on a rather large territory.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256694835_f0face59f8_o.jpg">
<p>
The quality of roads in Torzhok, alas, is extremely low, with the exception of the main streets.

<p>
Many houses have a gate on the side to the yard, designed as an extension of the house. This used to be the case everywhere, but now few places have survived, because in big cities the gates were torn down.

On the high bank of the Tvertsa there used to be a Resurrection Convent, but in the 1930s it was closed and turned into a factory.

<h2>Ostashkov</h2>
<p>
The city of Ostashkov stands on the shores of Lake Seliger, the name of which became notorious because of the Nashi congresses held there. And before it was an ordinary lake, well, let’s not talk about sad things. Ostashkov is interesting in itself, because it is one of the best preserved old cities in Russia.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257644450_06c0250de6_o.jpg">

<p>
The roads in Ostashkov are incredibly bad, with the exception of the main street.

Port. From here there are cruises on the lake, but only once a day, and every day also on different routes. Costs 800-1000 rubles. I didn’t go because otherwise I wouldn’t have gotten on the train to Toropets, so I’ll have to come here again sometime. As an option, you can also drive around the lake in your car, there is a road to the famous monastery where cruises go.

The whole trip was essentially organized in this way after I searched for transport from Ostashkov to Toropets on Yandex and was very surprised that there was a direct train between them, albeit once a day. It turns out that this railway has a cult status among train fans because it was built before the revolution, due to its remote location, old railway equipment and stations. Even steam locomotives operate from time to time. The train consisted of two carriages, in which there were seats, but at the same time the vestibule and conductor's compartment were like in a sleeper cars. I've never seen such carriages before.

Line Bologoe - Ostashkov - Toropets - <a href="https://goo.gl/mQDiu5">Velikiye Luki</a> - <a href="http://goo.gl/5QKWkZ">Polotsk</a> was built mostly for military purposes: the French financed it to make it easier for the Russians to transport troops to the front of the First World War.

The train travels slowly through dense forests, rivers, and lakes. Before Toropets itself, almost four hours away, there is only one city - Andreapol.

<h2>Toropets</h2>
<p>
The third and most remote historical city in the Tver region is Toropets (emphasis on the second syllable). Moscow is more than 400 kilometers away, but there are no big cities around for many kilometers: the closest ones are Tver, Smolensk, Pskov - 300 kilometers away. For some time after the war there was a separate region with the capital in <a href="https://goo.gl/mQDiu5">Velikie Luki</a>, but later it was split between Pskovs and Tver. Toropets is located just 20 kilometers from the Moscow-Riga highway, there are buses 3-4 times a day to Moscow (7 hours) and Tver (5 hours), trains once a day on the Velikiye Luki - Ostashkov route.

At the far end of the city there used to be a monastery, which was turned into a foundry and mechanical plant. I went to see what was there. I note again that Toropets has surprisingly good roads compared to other cities in the Tver region, not even in the center.

25 kilometers from Toropets there is the village of Staraya Toropa. It is interesting because long-distance trains Moscow - Velikiye Luki and local trains Rusanovo - Rzhev stop there, and I used the latter. The station is old and made of wood: the road was built at the beginning of the 20th century to connect Moscow with the port of Vindava (Ventspils now).

<h2>Rzhev</h2>
<p>
Finally, I stopped by the city of Rzhev - the second largest in the Tver region. This city was the scene of one of the bloodiest battles in history (according to various estimates, the number of deaths here is comparable to the Battle of Stalingrad). After the defeat near Moscow in 1941, German troops retreated and took positions in the area of ​​Rzhev and Vyazma (Smolensk region), this area was a protrusion in the front line, so the entire year 1942 Soviet troops tried to capture it. But they don’t talk about this in school, because the battle ended in nothing: on the one hand, in 1943 the Germans retreated due to defeats in the south and the threat of encirclement, on the other hand, the Red Army suffered colossal losses many times greater than the enemy, and calling it a success somehow doesn't work out. 90% of Rzhev was destroyed during the war.
