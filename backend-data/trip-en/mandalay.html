<h1>Myanmar: Mandalay, Monywa, Bagan, Inle Lake</h1>
<i>3-12 February 2016</i>
<h2>Mandalay</h2>
<p>
I thought Mandalay was a village with one-story sheds, but it turned out to be quite a decent city.
<p/>

<p>
Finally there was a normal hotel where I could wash myself with hot water. They even served a breakfast of fruit and omelet with coffee, just like the good old days.
<p/>

<p>
I was a little tired after a week in Myanmar, so I didn’t waste energy exploring the many local temples, especially since they are scattered over long distances, and the public transport system in Mandalay is very unclear. Unlike Yangon, where there are buses with route numbers, here there are just cattle trucks like this.

<p>
In the center of the city stands the former royal palace, surrounded by a square wall and a moat. The side of a square is two kilometers. There is a military unit in the palace, and only a couple of buildings are allowed for tourists, and the entrance is only from the most inconvenient side.

As in Yangon, colonial buildings have been preserved in Mandalay, but here they are found in smaller numbers.

The best part about Mandalay was that I found an authentic Chinese restaurant there. They spoke Chinese and prepared dishes with the same taste as in China (only at Burmese prices of 1-2 dollars per dish). It's called Happy one.

<h2>Mingun</h2>
<p>
Just 10 kilometers from Mandalay there is a very interesting town called Mingun. It is located on the other side of the river, so the easiest way to get there is by boat, although it is also possible to travel by minibus with a detour of 30 kilometers, but with a stop in the city of Sagaing (which has the only bridge in the area). This is what the river port of Mandalay looks like. Boats to Bagan also depart from here, but it is now faster and cheaper to get there by bus.

Suddenly! A small group of tourists from Russia with a guide was traveling to Mingun.

Taxi a la Myanmar! There is no point in it, just for fun to ride. It's a 5-minute walk to the attractions, but first we went in the other direction.

Well, now to the main thing. The king of Myanmar at the end of the 18th century suffered from gigantomania (a common disease in this region) and decided to make the largest pagoda in the world, 150 meters high.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256422236_2982737cdd_o.jpg">
<p>
Then the money ran out and a legend was invented that the king would die when the pagoda was completed, so construction stopped.
<p/>

In only one case did the king's megalomania reach its end - he made a giant bell. He probably just didn’t know that in far northern Moscow there was an even larger bell, so the Mingun one became only the second in the world.

<h2>Monywa</h2>
<p>
The city of Monywa (pronounced "mown - you - are") has not yet been included in the main tourist routes in Myanmar. In practice, in addition to the complete absence of foreigners, this means big problems with finding accommodation - those few hotels that have a license to serve tourists are hesitant and ask up to $30 for rooms, the real price of which is $7-8.
You can visit Monywa for two reasons - to break the long road from Mandalay to Bagan in half and at the same time to look at the giant Buddha statue built outside the city.

To get to the Buddha statue it’s about 25 kilometers one way (a motorcycle taxi, by the way, cost only $8 round trip). Halfway you can visit another attraction - the Thanboddhay Temple. It was founded in the 14th century, but the current building was built in the 1930s.

<h2>Bagan</h2>
<p>
It's time to talk about the most famous landmark of Myanmar.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255857256_47905fda31_o.jpg">
<p>
First, some joke advice on how to save $20 without buying an entrance ticket. Unlike <a href="../angkor">Angkor</a>, in Myanmar they decided that hiring a bunch of guards to stand at the entrance to each temple was too expensive. It is enough to place a ticket office at the main entrance, and 99% will not bother bypassing it, especially since the majority come anyway on organized tours. The ticket office is located on the road leading from the airport, train and bus stations to the center of Nyaung U town, where inexpensive hotels are located. All transport from afar goes through train stations and the airport (there are also ships on the river from Mandalay, but it seems like you have to buy a ticket immediately at the exit from the ship), so unless you have your own motorcycle, you won't be able to arrive from other directions. You need to go around the ticket office on the side; if you go on foot, there is only one difficulty - to walk of about 4 kilometers (it can be hot during the day). From the main road I turned right along the path marked on maps.me. First you walk along the airport fence, then through a residential area, then through a field (there are even a couple of pagodas there), then another residential area and the city center.
Is my conscience tormenting me because I didn’t buy a ticket? No, because this money is still going to someone's pocket. Collecting $20 from each of hundreds of tourists, they did not even manage to hire normal cleaners, which is why the territory of Bagan in some places is the same garbage dump as the rest of Myanmar.
<p/>

<p>
More precisely, here, near the main entrance, garbage is collected and dumped in the field behind the pagoda.
<p/>

<p>
Neither at the hotel nor on site did they check my ticket. I read that they can check in the evening near the temple where everyone goes to watch the sunset, so I went there in the afternoon.
The city of Nyaung U is not similar to Siem Reap, apparently there are much fewer tourists here, plus the rich live in another town of New Pagan, so it is an ordinary residential city. You can experience the local atmosphere in all its glory. This building looks like an abandoned building, but someone lives there.

In Nyaung U I found a normal hotel for $12, even with hot water. For some reason, there was a box full of condoms hanging in the hallway.

There are different ways to get around Bagan. Most travel on buses with a guide. There are no tuk-tuks, like in Angkor, in Pagan, instead there are carts with horses. This is the worst way: the most expensive, the slowest, and the most uncomfortable due to the dust on the roads. It is best to take a bicycle ($1.5 per day) or an electric motorbike ($5 per day). Bagan is more compact than Angkor, only 5 kilometers long, and the terrain is flat, so the bike is quite comfortable. There are jugs of water strategically scattered around the area to keep you from getting too thirsty. And in several temples there are even coolers with ice-cold water.
<p/>

In the most popular temples, if space allows, a market is held.

A couple of Padaung women, famous for their long necks with rings, were brought here specially for tourists. In reality, these people live in the area near the Thai border, many have fled to Thailand, so the Thais also make money by taking tourists to them.

Now, finally, let's look at Pagan itself.
<p/>

<p>
It is often written that UNESCO does not include Bagan in its legendary list due to the fact that there is a junta in Myanmar. There have been no sanctions for several years now, but nothing has changed. The real reason is completely different, and can be easily understood from the following illustration.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255858221_8ef55d7974_o.jpg">
<p>
Much of Bagan has been restored in this way.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255858161_d01f516938_o.jpg">
<p>
In addition, building a pagoda is a big plus in karma, so you can see orderly rows of brand new pagodas of the same type on the territory of Pagan.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256059628_78e8b4ff6d_o.jpg">

<h2>Inle Lake</h2>
<p>
Inle Lake is, as they say in America, a tourist trap. Tourists are taken on boats to souvenir shops and all sorts of workshops. Those who have been to Egypt and Turkey will understand. However, I still think that Inle Lake is worth a visit.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256211406_da71607eb5_o.jpg">
<p>
What do we have? In the morning, you can charter a boat at the pier for 20,000 kyat ($16). Those with an organized tour obviously pay much more and travel in crowds, but Alena and I got a boat for two. If you don’t go to Inthein (and many don’t!), then the price is even lower - 15,000, but Inthein is exactly the most interesting thing.
<p/>

There are several large villages on Inle Lake, where houses are on stilts, and travel is mainly by boats along canals. Local fishermen are known for attaching an oar to their leg to keep their hands free.

Inside, the tourist toilet looked solid. The men's and women's sections are separated by a partition with shards of broken glass.
