<i>12-13 June 2013</i>
<h2>Vladimir</h2>
<p>
Those arriving in Vladimir, upon rising from the station to the main street, are greeted by an incredible stream of schizophasia and spirituality. This is just no comment.

You'll never believe what it is. No, this is not a church. This is a planetarium.

Political clowns. They require some kind of family estates. I read their newspaper, enchanting paranoid delirium.
<p/>

The bus map is wonderful.

<p>
The bus station in Vladimir looks similar to many other stations. A mandatory attribute of the bus station is a large old map of the region with all bus routes. There are such ones in Mari El and in the Kaliningrad region. However, the Vladimir bus station has an interesting feature - it has excellent free Wi-fi.
<p/>

<h2>Ivanovo</h2>
<p>
This time I saw the city only from the bus window. In the summer it looks nicer.
<p/>
<h2>Kokhma</h2>
<p>
In Russia, there is a very strange custom: if someone dies in a Soviet building, then a coffin lid is placed near the entrance, while you can say goodbye to the deceased in his apartment. This doesn’t happen in large cities, because the population there is an order of magnitude larger, and not everyone knows all the residents of the house, and it’s hard to imagine that a deceased person would be left lying in an apartment.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256479438_d7d3db9c04_h.jpg"/>
<p>
I was in Kokhma twice: in 2008 and <a href="../kostroma">2011</a>, but then my acquaintance with the city was limited to the kiosk "Products. Tobacco. 24 hours. Cheap." It must be said that in small towns, stores that operate 24 hours a day, at night, as a rule, sell through a small window, even if the store itself is a large self-service supermarket. This is done for security reasons.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256280741_38be0147b1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Kokhma is a revolutionary city. Previously, there was a monument to Lenin in this place, but in the 90s it was blown up. Then, in the 90s, Kokhma separated from Ivanovo and became a proper city, however, life did not improve from this.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255550602_ae7cb9be0c_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The city has an obligatory attribute of modernity - a brand new temple.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255550407_5328c86cb1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And also the chimes on the administration building.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255550532_cd2fd988cd_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Otherwise, everything is the same here.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256280951_11d3ef56cb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Market from the nineties.

<p>
Roads.

<p>
Bridges.
<p/>

<p>
Street signs.

And the inscription at the entrance to the city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257027814_aa62cf2435_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And a phallic drawing on a Soviet building. People here do not strive for anything, they simply live in the astral plane.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255550642_3529dd41dc_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Although no, there is something new here. Here they painted berries on the tires.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257321695_29fbe71d4a_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And they put up a sign in English. Welcome to Kokhma!
<p/>

<h2>Plyos</h2>
<p>
Plyos is a resort on the Volga where Medvedev’s dacha is located. There was also a huge sanatorium here during the Soviet era, but it has been abandoned for twenty years, as a result it has turned into a gloomy Silent Hill in the middle of a rather positive city.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256852388_b2944759ed_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Houses that previously housed vacationers stand with broken windows and boards falling off.

<p>
Some were supposed to look beautiful in the old days.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257694100_60099cb2ef_h.jpg"/>
<p>

<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255923252_e6e66d9fcb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The building faces directly onto the street (unlike the others, which are located in a green area where there are no residential buildings.)
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255923197_ece990f72d_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There are also the ruins of an old hospital.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257397979_a634c28009_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Let's go back to more fun places.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255923272_e1841498fb_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Two steps from the main square of Plyos, some die-hard communist decorated his house with portraits of Lenin and Stalin.

<p>

<p/>

<p>
This happens in the center of Plyos.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255922947_709360f917_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Or so.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256852293_507ea8f0b4_h.jpg"/>
<p>
Quite a normal picture.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257397884_8a11fd043e_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And here is a rare beauty.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256852318_08b49135d5_h.jpg"/>
<p>
That also happens.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51257693790_ecd40bcee7_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But on the main promenade everything is fine.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256651041_d2071ea5b9_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The central square is also ok.

<h2>Privolzhsk</h2>
<p>
Welcome to nowhere.

<p>
Interesting logic: "Don't litter. Save the city budget". I think most people who litter don't care about budget.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256867263_b8820660c2_h.jpg"/>
<p>
But there is a very cheerful monument to Lenin in the central square.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255938277_c8c961e4b3_h.jpg"/>
<h2>Shuya</h2>
<p>
I was peacefully photographing a trash can near the Staraya Shuya restaurant, when a strange-looking dork came out of the restaurant and began to explain to me that the law is that even on the territory near the restaurant you cannot take photographs without permission. I was polite and calm, and it paid off! Although I deleted the photo of the urn (I didn’t even restore it because I took it out of boredom), the guy asked to take a photo of him, so I still had a great photo of a colorful character.
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256253769_557df09d10_h.jpg"/>
<p>
In Shuya, on the main square there is not a monument to Lenin or the heroes of the Great Patriotic War, but a monument to the victims of repression.
<p/>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51254774887_660f9eee87_h.jpg"/>
<p>
There is more.
<p/>

<p>
In Shuya, people on the walls <i>speak out</i>.
<i>Sorry, I don't know how I fell in love. Sorry, I can't be without you. Tell me, why did I confess. Sorry, I love you.</i>
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51256254164_4f9a763db3_h.jpg"/>
<p>
And they conduct dialogues.
<i>You will never see me again - Fucking awesome!</i>
<p/>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51255710018_f5b35319c1_h.jpg"/>
<p>
The center of Shuya is ok, which is very good for one of the poorest regions of Russia.
<p/>

<p>
The bridge is absolutely gorgeous.
